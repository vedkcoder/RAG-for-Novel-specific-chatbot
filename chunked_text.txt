the storage room next to the kendo club trying to peep from the hole on the wall unfortunately i couldnt get a look because matsuda and motohama wouldnt get away from the hole seriously thos e guys i couldnt calm myself down either when those two idiots kept saying things like ohhh murayama seriously has big tits and ahhh katase sure has nice legs of course i wanted to see but guys were approaching the storage room so i fled fro m the scene however something extraordinary happened to someone like me whod otherwise be spending his days being a pervert will you please go out with me a girl confessed to me i finally knew what being a teenager was like for a guy like me whod been single his entire life this was a dream come true my girlfriends name is amano yuumachan shes a girl with silky black hair and a slender body shes so cute that i fell in love with her at first sight i mean wouldnt you say yes right away if a cute girl came up to you and said hyoudou kun i love you will you please go out with me thatd
be a dream come true for a guy like me whose never had a girlfriend in his entire life it wouldnt be weird if someone asked what dating sim did you get that from but it really happened it was a miracle a beautiful girl confessed to me i thought at first that this was some sort of joke like this was a penalty game her friends were making her do and that they were watching us from afar nearby i couldnt help thinking that way up until then i believed that i was born to be unpopular with girls but ever since then no longer was i some girlfriendless guy i felt like the world around me changed im not sure how to describe it but it felt was like my heart was at ease i wanted to just go up to any guy i passed and yell i won with all this newfound confidence i started to feel sorry for my two buddies matsuda and motohama who were still single on our first date after we started dating i was ready to put a plan id came up with a while back into action fufufu ive brushed my
teeth numerous times since last night not missing a single spot i even went ahead and bought a new pair of pants since you never know what could happen i arrived to our meeting spot with a super virgin attitude i got here three hours before yuumachan did so in the mean time i counted up to a hundred girls wearing glasses walk past me as i did that i received a suspicious leaflet from a weirdo handing them out it was an occultlooking thing with a weird magiccircle and a sentence your wish will be granted written on it i wanted to throw it away but i decided to put it in my pocket since i didnt have enough time to when yuumachan arrived i told her dont worry i just got here too bullseye i did it ive always wanted to say that then we started walking and held hands i was really touched being on a date with my beautiful girlfriend and holding her hand was the best i was so moved that i nearly burst into tears but i shouldnt rush it nows not the time to panic yet after that we started our date by
first going to a clothing store and taking a look at decorations for our rooms for lunch we ate at a family restaurant just like how any normal high schoolers would and yuumachan was eating her chocolate parfait cutely my stomach was full just from looking at her yeah i felt like i understood how other teenagers feel when they go on dates it felt as if i was alive for the firs t time mum thanks for giving birth to me dad i was worried that i wouldnt be able to continue our family line but it looks like you dont have to worry about that any more as i was thinking about all of this evening had arrived time for the climax maybe a kiss before heading home i got hyped just thinking about that oh maybe well go even further thats what my horny young self thought we were at the park away from town and there wasnt anyone here besides us thanks to that my erotic fantasies started piling up i shouldve read a guide book on dirty things yuumachan had already let go of my hand and stood before the fountain it sure was fun
today yuuma chan smiled kuu damn shes cute the sunset behind her set the perfect mood hey ise kun what is it yuuma chan theres something i want to do to celebrate our first date could you listen to my wish oh yeah its here this is it this must be it my breath smells good check im mentally prepared hnn my heart is beating so fast wwhat are you w wishing for aaaaagh my voices sounds deep shell find out that im thinking of something stupid ive made the dumbest mistake after coming this far but yuumachan just continued to smile at me she then said clearly will you die for me huh what was that huh thatshuh sorry can you repeat that again i think theres something wrong with my ears i mustve heard her wrong i thought that had to be it so i asked her again but will you die for me she clearly repeated herself this time as she laughed her words werent making any sense just as i was about smile and say thats so funny yuuma chan flap black wings appear from her back she then started flapping her wings the black feathers
float in the air and then drop down to my feet what is that huh certainly yuuma chan is cute like an angel but angel no theres no way thats true is this some sort of trick my beautiful girlfriend is flapping her wings as the sun sets behind her it looks like a scene out of a fantasy story but theres no way i could believe something like this her cute looking eyes changed into cold scary eyes the short time i spent with you was fun it was like playing house with a little child yuuma chans voice sounds very cold her tone is like an adults and her mouth is forming into a cold smile buzz a sound much louder than the noise a game console makes vibrates in the air it makes a loud buzzing noise and then it appears in her hands it looked like a spear is it glowing it seems like its a bulk of light or something actually it is a spear hyu the sound of the wind a nasty noise soon follows after it don the moment i thought something grazed my stomach the spear which was in her hand pierced
my stomach she threw that at me but rather than that why i tried to pull the spear out of me but it disappeared the only thing left was a huge hole in my stomach and blood which was flowing out from it blood blood my head felt dizzy and my eyesight became blurry i was already lying on the ground i hadnt realised when my legs lost their balance footsteps close in on me while im down on the ground a small voice vaguely reaches me it s yuuma chans sorry you were a threat to us so we decided to get rid of you early on if you want to hold a grudge then hate the god who put the sacred gear inside you sacred what i cant even ask her a question as i lie on the ground her footsteps get further away from me as that happened i started to lose consciousness the hole in my stomach must be fatal i dont feel any pain but i realised that i was in seriously bad condition because i could feel that i was about to pass out it must feel nice if i pass out now as
if im going to sleep but if that happens then ill die for sure are you serious am i going to die this young i havent even lived half of my life yet how could i laugh if i died because my girlfriend stabbed me at this weird park ku my consciousness starts to fade away as i thought about that it feels like numerous things within me are disappearing oh yeah i wonder whats going to happen at school tomorrow will matsuda and motohama be shocked will they cry for meno way not them mum dadi havent done anything to please them yet as their son ratherits not going to be funny if they find those porno magazines i was hiding after i diewhy the hell am i thinking of that when im about to die i can stillmove my hands i touched my stomach and brought my hand in front of me its redcrimson red my whole hand is red this is my bloodall of its my blood then she came into my mind the one who im imagining is that one girl the beauty with crimson hair every time ive seen her my eyes were drawn to
her crimson hair if i was going to die i wish it was inside the arms of a beautiful girl like her i felt like i was cheating on yuumachan thinking like this wait yuumachan was the one who killed me but if i were to die then id rather die after groping yuuma chans breasts haha my perverted delusions dont stop even as im dying aaah my eyes have gotten even more blurry is this finally the end for me damn i really had a boring life if i were to be reborn id want to be so you were the one who called me suddenly someone appeared in front of me and she spoke to me i cant tell who it is since my eyes are blurry looks like youre dying your woundoh my looks like something interesting is happening to you so youre the onetruly this is intriguing shes laughing as if she found something interesting i wonder whats so funny if youre dying then ill take it your life that is from now on youll live only for me before i passed out i saw brilliant crimson hair in front of me life1 i quit being
a human part 1 wake up wake up if you dont wake up im going to k kiss you hmm its a tsundere voice alarm clock but it doesnt have a function to actually wake its owner up in bed instead said owner had just seen a nightmare and fell to the floor thats me its the worst way to wake up i had that awful dream again lately ive been having the same dream w here yuuma chan kills me but im still alive so it had to be a dream wake up ise just like every morning mums voice comes from downstairs i know im up now after giving her a quick reply i pick myself up from the floor haa my days off to a bad start again i feel so down i put on my uniform while heaving a deep sigh part 2 im off then i yawn as i leave the house during the walk to school i cant help but close my eyes due to the sunlight aaah its so annoying lately ive been starting to feel weak under the sun it feels like the sunlight is piercing through my skin and i cant
stand it anyways the morning sunshine isnt of any use to me because i cant get myself up in the morning at all since i havent been able to wake myself up lately my mum has been waking me up every day on the other hand i become more nocturnal theres something inside me that rises up and makes my anxiety rise ive completely become a night person its weird somethings wrong i often stay up late but it used to be a miracle if i managed to stay up till 1 oclock lately however i can easily stay up till 3 or 4 oclock also ive been going to sleep after sunrise and thats been my daily routine as of now im not addicted to online games nor am i addicted to night shows whats happening to me is my brain trying to avoid sleeping so i dont have to see that dream where my girlfriend kills me well thats what i personally think so that cant be it its natural for the body to feel the need to sleep the feeling i have at night i think its something completely different from before i dont know how to
explain it but i feel pumped and like something mysterious is rising from the depths of my body i went out at night to test it my walking pace increased and my heart shook with joy when i blended in with the darkness of the night i dashed out at night on a whim and to my surprise i had incredible speed if i joined the track team i could easily become the main runner also i dont run out of stamina in fact i have so much that i can do a full marathon as if it was just a simple jog i became overconfident and when i tried sprinting during the day it was so horrible that i thought my stamina at night was just a dream no its an average speed for a highschooler but theres a huge difference when comparing my nightself and my dayself i become weird at night that might sound like something a weirdo would say but this feeling i have at night of being unleashed and the excitement i have is changing me into someone different ugghlike i thought the sunlight is giving me a hard time unlike at night i become
totally weak during the day no matter how much i think about it theres something definitely wrong with me i cant help but think that ive changed ever since that day i went on a date with yuumachan part 3 a private school kuoh academy thats where i attend its a co ed school right now but since it used to be a girls school until a couple of years ago theres more girls than boys as the grades go down the number of boys increase but overall girls outnumber the boys im a second year high school student and the ratio of girls to boys in my class is 7 to 3 but for third year students its 8 to 2 even now the girls have far more authority than boys and the majority of the students in the student council are girls with the student president being a girl as well its a school where boys cant stand tall but even knowing that i still joined this school its a simple story theres more girls here that alone is a wonderful thing the only reason why i was able to pass the entrance exams which is said to
be really hard is due to my perverted guts i want to be surrounded by girls as i study for that reason alone im currently attending kuoh whats wrong with that whats wrong with being a pervert its my life i wont let anyone argue against me im going to build a harem here and so that was my mission when i first started attending but now i feel depressed i was nave for thinking i could make 2 or 3 girlfriends here with the majority of students being girls only one group of good looking guys are popular and girls dont even look at me to be more precise they ignore me like trash lying on the floor shit this wasnt my plan nonsense in my plan i was supposed to get my first girlfriend straight after i entered this school after that id have broken up with her and started dating a new girl and by the time i graduated heaps of girls were supposed to fight over me in a battle royale aat this rate my plans will end up being long gone dreams wait arent they already dreams what was wrong with them was it the
era i was born in the law oris there something wrong with me uwaa aaaaah i dont want to even think about it this is pretty much what goes through my mind every day i arrived at my classroom while heaving a big sigh and sat down in my chair hey buddy how was the dvd i lent you it was some good stuff wasnt it the bald head guy speaking to me is my first buddy matsuda he might look like a sportsman but hes just a pervert who makes sexually harassing comments every day he was a sportsboy during his time in junior high where he broke multiple records but h es in the photo club now hes really open about his ambition of wanting to take photos of every part of girls bodies his nickname is the perverted baldy and the sexual harassing paparazzi futhe wind sure was strong this morning thanks to that i was able to get a good view of the girls panties the guy with the glasses whos trying to act cool is my second buddy motohama he has a special ability called scouter that lets him get the numerical values of the
girls measurements through his glasses along with a special body where his power level plummets when he takes his glasses off his nickname is the perverted glasses and the three size scouter these two are my evil buddies seriously seeing these guys faces in the morning really makes me feel down i feel sick i got some nice stuff matsuda opened his bag and let out the things inside without any hesitation the books and dvds being piled up on my desk all have suggestive titles eek a small scream comes from a girl far away from us well of course shed react like that after all something like this is happening this early what i hear next from the girls are discriminating comments like you guys are the worst and go die you filthy scumbags shut it this is how we ent ertain ourselves girls and kids should look away and keep away or else ill rape all of you inside my head your words are vulgar as always matsuda kun not long ago i wouldve went wow where did you get these treasures from with sparkling eyes at everything piled on my desk but since ive been feeling
terrible every morning lately im not in the mood matsuda sighed as he looked at my dull face hey hey hey why you look so down when you have all this treasure in front of you you havent been in the mood lately its really weird youre like a completely different person motohama also said while he poked at his glasses with a bored expression i mean i want to go wow whered you get these from are you trying to lure me into deprav ity but ive been lacking the energy to lately you sick or something no that couldnt be it theres no way that you the manifestation of all sexual desires would ever get sick motohama made a rude remark honestly hes just plain rude then matsuda did a hand gesture as if he realised something oh is this a side effect of that imaginary girlfriend delusion youve been talking about yuuma chan was it do you guys seriously not remember her both of them gave me a sympathetic look in response like we said before we seriously dont know who youre talking about you really should get a check up right motohama yeah im going to
say this again but weve never met a girl named yuuma chan they always act like this every time i a sk them about yuumachan at first i thought they were teasing me but after having a serious talk with them i found out that wasnt the case i definitely remember introducing her to them they were saying things like how come a beauty like her is ises girlfrieeeeend and the world must be having a system errorise you havent done anything illegal have you and kept on making rude comments i remember getting cocky and telling them you guys should get girlfriends as well i remember it very clearly but they dont remember it no they dont have any memory of her at all its as if amano yuuma never existed its as if the time i spent with yuuma chan never happened like those two said it feels like i just imagined it on top of that they showed me i had no record of her phone number or mail address on my phone was it deleted from the memory did someone delete it that cant be theres no way i would delete it so who did i
called the number i had memorised but it wasnt currently i n use so does that mean she never existed was it just all in my imagination something that crazy isnt possible i want to deny it but apart from my memory theres no evidence to prove she existed if i think about it i didnt know where she lived since she went to another school i found the school where they wore the same uniform as her so i asked some students there about her but there wasnt a single student there that fit her description so who was my girlfriend who was i dating so has the d ream ive been having just some fantasy i made up was i telling matsuda and motohama about my dream as if it was all real what am i a pervert i distinctly remember her face you know theres something off about all of this like the strange strength i get at night something is definitely wrong but what is it while im thinking about the past incidents matsuda rests his hand on my shoulder well were in the middle of our youth so some weird stuff like that can happen
to us okay then you guys c ome over to my place after school lets watch my secret collection together thats an excellent idea matsuda kun you should definitely invite ise kun as well of course im going to invite him motohama kun were high school boys who operate on sexu al desires if we dont do anything perverted itd be disrespectful to the parents who gave birth to us the two of them smirk lecherously perverts no matter how you look at them theyre just some perverted creeps sadly im also one of them well never mind i also live for stuff like this okay then today we wont hold back well get some soda and chips while watching porn dvds i say because i cant be bothered to think oh yeah thats it thats definitely the ise we know thats the spirit we need to enjoy our youth even more matsuda and motohama are starting to get excited ill put the incident about yuuma chan on hold i need to take a break sometimes as well for today ill forget about that and get hooked into porn like how boys our age do it happened after we made
plans for the afternoon there was a crimson colour that caught my attention a brilliant crimson colour the schoolyard can be seen from the classroom window and my eyes were glued towards a certain girl the girl with crimson red hair our school idol whose beauty is beyond a normal humans her slim proportions werent the shape of a japanese girls of course she isnt japanese after all i heard people say that shes from northern europe attending a japanese high school due to her fathers work anyone would have their heart stolen by her after witnessing her beauty rias gremory shes a third year student so that makes her my senior when i realised it everyone including me were staring at her as well both boys and girls even matsuda and motohama were also starting at her this happens every morning everyone looks at her when she walks past them some people stop walking others stop talking just about everyone turns around to gaze at her the wind gently blows her crimson hair as everyone watches her her long crimson hair which comes down to her hips makes her surroundings look like its coloured in crimson when the wind
blows it her beautiful skin which is white as snow is remarkable beautiful thats the only way to describe her in one word in fact its the only word you need to describe her i was also fascinated by her beauty and noble atmosphere im so fascinated by her that i always stop what im doing every time i see her but lately the way i see her has changed shes definitely beautiful but shes too beautiful ive started to feel a little bit scared of her beauty and fear her from the bottom of my heart i dont know why ive started feeling this way but its been like this ever since yuuma chans disappearance then her eyes move her clear blue eyes grasp hold of me i feel as if my hearts being grabbed by her whats this feeling its like that feeling you get when someone superior to you is standing in front of you she narrows her blue eyes and it seems like shes smiling is she looking at me that cant be i dont have any connection to her then i suddenly remember something from the dream i had at the end of the dream
there was a person with crimson hair who spoke to me the one who seemed to be gentle yet also cold while im comparing her to the person from my dream shes already out of my sight part 4 i seriously wan na grope some tits im hugging matsuda who couldnt stop crying as all of us watched the last v ideo from our porn dvd marathon after leaving school we started watching porn with high spirits we were all happy and excited when we started but as we watched more we began to get depressed instead because the question why dont we have girlfriends came into our minds i felt like crying after we had a serious talk about it matsuda hadnt stopped crying since 3 movies back motohamas trying to act cool but tears are flowing from his eyes behind his glasses half an hour ago motohama said in a q uiet voice a girl asked me to meet her behind the gymthat was my first time getting mugged by a girl so even i was about to cry after hearing that i wonder what three boys whore all glum while watching porn look like apparently the answer
is three unpopular guys damn it i feel like hating this world after thinking that theres guys my age having sex with girls right now as i thought about that the last film ended and it was already dark outside when i looked at my watch it was already 10 oclock i already told my parents that im at matsudas place but theyll worry about me if i stay here any longer and also ill be late for school tomorrow anyways ill get going now after i said that all of us stood up and started packing up see ya after we split from matsuda at the entrance motohama and i headed home its a beautiful night on nights like these its normal to feel like watching porn motohama said some weird crap while he looked at the sky and gave a big sigh he looked really down well by tomorrow both of them will be back to their usual selves see ya tomorrow yeah sweet dreams i split up with motohama on my way home but he didnt seem energetic when he waved to me ill probably send him a text message afterwards to cheer him up a few
minutes pass by after i split up with motohama im heading home but the energy flowing within me is rising its a symptom of the overflowing with energy at night thing like i thought theres definitely something wrong with me this isnt a normal occurrence since my senses have improved drastically as well my eyes and ears have became especially good i can even hear conversations from inside other peoples houses and see the street even if its nightthis is really weir d since i can even see clearly in complete darkness it feels like these abilities have become quite strong lately thats because this chilly feeling im having right now is the real deal from these chills i can feel that someones been watching me for a while now i can feel a mysterious atmosphere ahead of me im shaking so much and it only gets worse its a man wearing a suit glaring at me with fierce eyes it feels like ill freeze up just by looking into his eyes isnt this what you call bloodthirsty i can definitely feel hostility from him no this is something more dangerous this is definitely bloodthrist the man walks closer silently
hes coming towards me so he is after me a pervert a dangerous guy am i in trouble this is bad i still havent stopped shaking why did i have to encounter some dangerous guy on my way home this is rare to meet someone like you in a place like this whats he saying no no it isnt weird if crazy people like him start spouting nonsense so hes a dangerous guy after all oh shit what should i do if he takes out a knife i dont know any self defence martial arts nor have i ever been in a fight before ii know my abilities which power up during night thats it i can use it to run away from here walking backwards i put some distance between us the guy whos releasing a perverted atmosphere starts to walk towards me trying to run away tell me whos your master it must be someone with either a very low rank or a weird hobby to cho ose this place as a territory so who is it i dont even know what the hell youre talking about step i turn around and sprint at full speed fast im
insanely fast its weird for me to say this but my speed during night is insane i just continue to run while going through different streets eventually heading into unfamiliar ones i havent gotten out of breath yet i can keep on running if thats the case then im going to run until he cant catch up to me after about 15 minutes i come into an open area its a park i stop running and walk instead i walk up to the water fountain while trying to catch my breath i look around the park as i stand under the street lamp something feels mysterious about this place i know this place i rememb er this park thats right this is the last place i visited on my date with yuuma chan man what a coincidence or should i call it a miracle did i come here unconsciously that cant be chills i feel chills on my back i feel thatsomeones behind me i slowly turn around and a black feather drops in front of me is it a crows feather no this isnt did you think id let you escape this is why lowly beings are a pain
to handle the person in front of me is a man wearing a suit with black wings growing from his back its the dangerous guy from before an angel no no this isnt some fairy tale so those cant be is it cosplay it looks too real for cosplay are those rreal wings no way tell me the name of your master its a hindrance to be bothered by your kind for that we will wait are you a stray if you have no master then that will explain the worried expression on your face the suspicious guy is mumbling to himself dont make stuff up on your own this situation is serious but i suddenly remember the incident i had in my dream the dream about that date at the very end of that dream i was killed by yuumachan right in front of this water fountain yeah by the yuumachan who had black wings and theres a guy with black wings in front of meis this that thing where a dream becomes reality hey hey how did a hot chick turn into a guy no thats not important whats important is whats going on right now if this
is going according to that dream then the next thing thatll happen to me is hmph i dont feel any presence of your master nor your comrades neither do i not see anything that is trying to hide its presence either also theres no magic circle appearing here according to the current situation you are a stray so it wont be a problem if i kill you the guy who just said some scary stuff raises his hand no matter how you look at it his hand is directed towards me i can hear a noise i know this phenomenon something that looks like light starts to gather in his hand hold on a sec this fantasy stuff should just stay in my dream the light then shapes itself into something resembling a spear a spear so it is a spear i was pierced in my stomach by that thing in my dream and i went through hell im going to get killed by the time i realise it its already pierced my stomach then something comes out of my mouth gough lots of blood comes out of my mouth followed by an intense pain it hurts it hurts so
much i fall down on my knees on the spot i can feel my insides burning the pain spreads throughout my body and it hurts so much that i cant stand it intensethat doesnt even begin to describe this pain i try to pull out the spear with my hand but the pain spreads to my hand as soon as i touch it its hot scorching hot theres burn marks on the places that touched it guuaaaah i start to whine it hurts it hurts so much since my hand is in this state is the spear burning my insides when i thought about that the pain increased so this is how it feels like to be burnt from the inside my tears arent stopping due to the intense pain step step then theres the sound of footsteps coming towards me i look up and the mysterious man makes another spear in his hand it must hurt since light is poisonous to beings like you getting hit by it will result in fatal injuries i thought this weakened spear would be enough to kill you but your body is tougher than i thought so ill strike you again but this
time ill put a bit more strength into it now youre done for is he trying to finish me off ill be killed if i get hit by that thing again as im thinking i start to remember the dream i had crimson the brilliant crimson colour will no theres no way shell help me that was a dream so is this a dream as well if its a dream then please help me even if its just a dream i dont want to be in this situation hyu when i thought i heard the sound of the wind an explosion materialises in front of me when i looked up there was smoke coming from that mans palm blood spilling out of it dont you dare touch him a woman walks past me crimson hair i can tell who it is even just from her back its that person i saw in my dream i wasnt able to see her face in that dream but now im certain that shes the one crimson hair you must be a woman from the house of gremory the man glares at the crimsonhaired woman with eyes full of hatred my name is rias
gremory how are you doing fallen angel san if you are trying to hurt this boy then i wont hold back rias gremory yes shes the senior student at my school the beauty with crimson hair fufu well well so this boy belongs to you this town must also be a part of your territory then well then ill apologise for today but i advise you not to let your servant loose people like me might slay him while having a walk thanks for the advice since this town is under my surveillance if you get in my way then i wont hold back ill say the same to you heiress of the house of gremory my name is dohnaseek i hope we wont meet again the man spreads his black wings and his body starts to float he then flies up into the sky the man glares at riassenpai and me once more then disappears into the sky1 so is it safe now i feel a bit relieved but my visions getting blurry and it feels like im about to pass out huh isnt this bad this is definitely bad right ara are you about to faint this is

at her is making me feel bad i cant become a complete pervert ssenpai i cant help but say it what is it bbreastsi can see everything i said it while looking away from her i want to take a look but thats that i have to endure it if you want to look then go ahead senpai says that daringly while putting on her uniform putting on a smirk japanese words like that exist an electrical shock went through my body tears are falling from my eyes from hearing that phrase you never learn about in school im deeply moved is your stomach all right senpai asks me stomach i touch my stomach while watching senpai get dressed you were stabbed yesterday with that statement i was sufficiently alert thats right i was stabbed by a guy with wings at the park yesterday i was stabbed by a spear that looked like it was made up of light but there arent any marks left on my stomach i was sure there was a hole thats wasnt the type of wound that heals within a day there was so much blood coming out of it that wasnt a dream or
was it a dream by the way what happened yesterday wasnt a dream senpai says it as if she read my mind ii was sure i was wounded i healed you it was critical but thanks to your strong body it was healable with my power in a night i shared some of my demonic powers with you by embracing you while we were naked i was able to do it because w ere from the same clan what isshe saying huh hugged each other while naked eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh wait does that mean its all right im still a virgin she says it as if she reread my mind ah is that so for some reason i felt relieved should i feel relieved dont make a weird face like that this world is surrounded by much more mysterious things that you cant even imagine senpai approaches me while in her underwear she starts to pat my cheek with her slim fingers my face gets red i cant help blushing since a beauty like her is doing it im rias gremory im a devil devil huh is that a joke im not really sure and im your master nice to meet you

guys have you ever seen a pair of real tits before with that one sentence both of them trembled in fear part 8 after school hi how are you doing i looked at the male student who came to see me through halflidded eyes the guy in front of me is our schools number one handsome prince kiba yuuto hes captured the hearts of the girls in our school with just his smile alone by the way hes in the same year as me though hes in a different class you can hear the girls screaming with joy from the classroom and from out in the corridor shut up its so damn noisy in here so what are you doing here i reply to him in a dismissive tone but kiba responds without breaking his smile ive come here under rias gremory senpais orders with that one statement i immediately understood why he was here i see so hes the one senpai told me shed send ok ok so what do you want me to do i want you to follow me no this time the girls screamed no for hyoudou and kiba kun to walk beside each other youll
get infected kiba kun i wont agree with kiba kun hyoudou no maybe its hyoudou kiba kun theyre saying some weird crap shut up already seriously just shut up ah all right i agreed to follow him ill say this beforehand i hate handsome guys i followed kiba whod already walked ahead of me hhey is e matsuda shouted my name dont worry my friend im not going to have a fight thats right you dont have to worry about me pal whatre you going to do with this dvd me the molester and the udon matsuda says out loud while holding said dvd up high i then looked out the window i followed kiba and we ended up at the back of the school here which is surrounded by trees theres a building known as the old school building apparently it was used a long time ago and theres no sign of people here its so creepy that its listed as one of the schools seven wonders the building looks very old and is made from wood but there arent any broken windows and its hard to tell if anythings broken from its appearance its old but it isn
t that bad buchou is here7 kiba says buchou is he talking about senpai huh buchou did senpai belong to a particular club does this mean hes part of that club as well its getting even more mysterious oh well as long as i follow him ill be able to meet with senpai we entered the two story high building and went up the stairs delving further into the building even the corridor looks clean it seems like even the rooms that arent in use dont even have a single dust speck in them when you think about old buildings you expect it to be full of insects spider webs and dust but i havent seen any yet they must be cleaning this place quite often as i was thinking about that we seemed to have reached our destination kiba stopped in front of a particular classroom i was shocked by the sign on the door that read occult research club occult research club just r eading the name made me wonder im not saying that the club sounds weird but thinking that riassenpai is a member of the occult research club is buchou ive brought him kiba waits for
the approval through the wooden door then senpai replied yes come in looks like senpais inside kiba opened the door and im shocked as i followed him into the room theres weird signs and words in every area of the classroom the floor walls and even the ceiling are all covered with them and the one which stands out the most is the circle drawn at the center of the room it looks like a magic circle that takes up most of the space in here i can feel something creepy and weird from it theres also a couple of sofas and desks in the room hmm theres someon e sitting on one of the sofas its a girl with a small frame i know her i know that girl shes the first year girl toujou konekochan shes a first year but she looks like an elementary student because of her childish face and small body shes quit e popular amongst a certain groups of guys the girls as well and shes treated like a mascot for being so cute shes eating youkan quietly8 she always has a sleepy expression if i remember correctly shes said to be very emotionless
she realised we entered and our eyes meet this is hyoudou issei kun next kiba introduces her to me toujou konekochan bows her head ah nice to meet you i also bow my head after the greetings she continues to eat her youkan hmm its just like the rumours say maybe shes just a very quiet girl sha the sound of water flowing comes from the back of the room is that from a shower then i realised theres a shower curtain at the back of the room as well as a shadow on the curtain its the shadow of a girl taking a shower huh a shower this classroom comes with a shower kyu then theres the sound of the shower stopping buchou take this huh theres someone else besides her i hear a girls voice that doesnt belong to senpai thank you akeno looks like senpai is changing behind the curtain i start to blush after remembering what happened this morning senpai you sure had an impressive body looks like i wont be needing porn for a while what a lecherous face someone muttered when i look in the direction it came from its toujou koneko chan i
look at her but the little first year student is just eating youkan is that so so i have a lecherous face im sorry then jya then the curtain opens senpai stands there in her uniform she looks seductive with her wet hair she looks at me then smiles im sorry i couldnt take a s hower last night because i spent the night at your place so i just took a shower now ah is that so but whats bugging me is the fact that theres even a shower in here then i look behind senpai theres someone behind herare you kidding me im so s hocked that i lose my voice blackhair in a ponytail the ponytail which is said to be nearly extinct the one whos said to be the last person with a ponytail at our school that pretty face which is always smiling the one with a japanese atmosphere the one whos called a yamato nadeshiko even though shes a student and also one of our school idols himejima akenosenpai9 she who along with rias senpai is said to be one of the two great onee samas she whos idolised by both male and female
students ara ara hello my name is himejima akeno pleased to make your acquaintance she introduces herself politely with a smile her voice sounds fascinating ooh my name is hyoudou issei n nice to meet you too even though im nervous i greeted her after riassenpai confirmed that we finished our introductions she started talking looks like everyone is here hyoudou i sseikun no let me call you ise yyes we the occult research club welcome you eh ah yes as a devil dad and mum looks like im in for something big heres your tea ah thank you im sitting on a sofa and himejima senpai has made tea for me i drink it quickly it tastes good ara ara thank you very much himejima senpai laughs happily with a ufufu kiba konekochan riassenpai and i are sitting on the sofas surrounding the table akeno you sit over here as well yes buchou himejimasenpai sits next to riassenpai then everyone looks at me wwhat is itim getting nervous since everyones looking at me in a cramped place like this then riassenpai spoke ill get straight to the point were all devils yyou definitely did get straight to the point
your expression says you dont believe what im saying well that cant be helped you did see the man with the black wings last night didnt you shes right if that wasnt a dream then i really did see tha t thats a fallen angel theyre former angels who used to serve god but have fallen to hell because they had evil intentions theyre also the enemy of us devils so now were talking about fallen angels looks like were entering a fantasy story we the devils have been at war with the fallen angels since ancient times fighting over the possession of the underworld which is also known as hell in the human world the underworld is split into two areas one for devils and one for fallen angels the devils form pacts with humans and receive their sacrifices to increase their strength while the fallen angels on the other hand control humans to eliminate devils the angels come in to destroy these two races on gods orders which created the three force s this has been going on since ancient times no no senpai its hard for someone normal like me to take all that in is this
what members of an occult research club do so this conversation has been about the club activities then the occult research club is merely a camouflage its my hobby in actuallity its a gathering place for us devils hold on this is part of the club activities right amano yuuma hearing that name i open my eyes in shock where did she hear that name that day you were on a date with amano yuuma right if youre joking around then can you please stop now i dont want to talk about that here theres anger in my voice thats because that topic is like taboo to me now when i talked about it before no one believed me and no one remembered her everyone told me it mustve been a dream that it was just my delusions nobody believed me and no one remembered she existed i dont know where she heard the story from but i wont accept it if she says that its all occult instead ill just be mad she existed for certain riassenpai stated clearly well it looks like she tried to erase all evidence of herself from around you riassenpai snapped her finger and
himejimasenpai took out a photo im speechless after seeing whos in that photo this is her right amano yuuma chan yeah the person on the photo is my girlfriend whos seemed to had vanished i had taken a picture of her with my cell phone but it had disappeared the photo is a clear picture of her and there are black wings growing from her back this girl isno this is a fallen angel shes the same kind as the one that attacked you last night a fallen angel yuuma chan is a fallen angel riassenpai continued this fallen angel came in contact with you to accomplish a certain goal after she accomplished it she got rid of any record and evidence regarding herself goal yes to kill you wwhat the hell wwhy did she have to kill me calm down ise it couldnt be helpe dno you were just unlucky there are possessors who havent been killed what do you mean unlucky is she saying that i was just unlucky to be killed by yuumachan that day huh killed but im still alive im still here like before that day you went on a date with her and then
went to the park where you were killed with a spear of light but im still alive more than that why was i targeted yeah there arent any reasons for me to be targeted by her why do the fallen angels have to target me the reason why she approached you is so she could check if there was a dangerous object inside you she must have received a weak response from it which is why she took her time checking you then she confirmed that you were a human who possessed a sacred gear sacred gear i was familiar with that term sorry you were a threat to us so we decided to get rid of you early on if you want to hold a grudge then hate the god who put the sacred gear inside you thats what yuuma chan said then so theres a sacred gear inside of me kiba then spoke sacred gear are an irregular power thats bestowed to certain humans for example most of the people whose names are recorded in history are said to be possessors of a sacred gear they used the power of their sacred gears to record their name in
history presently there are people who possess sacred gears within their bodies you know those people who play an important role worldwide most of them possess a sacred gear himejimasenpai continued after kiba riassenpai then continued to explain most of the sacred gears have functions that are only usable in human society but there are exceptional sacred gears that are a threat to us the devils and fallen angels ise raise your hand eh i have to raise my hand why do it quickly riassenpai urges me to do it so i raised my left arm close your eyes and imagine the strongest being that comes to mind sstrongest being son goku from dragon ball then imagine it imagine him in a particular pose where he looks the strongest i imagined goku when hes shooting his kamehameha is this alright lower your arm slowly and stand up i get up from the sofa and lower my arm now mimic their pose you have to imagine it vividly okay no holding back crap theres people around me and i have to copy goku doing the kamehameha at this age im too embarrassed to do it just because im closing my eyes
doesnt mean that no ones gon na laugh at me do it quickly riassenpai urges me again ooooooi are you kidding me do i seriously have to do it shit then look its hyoudou isseis first and last time doing the kamehameha kamehameha i said it while i had both my opened hands stuck together and pushed forward at chest height this is the kamehameha pose now open your eyes here which is filled with demonic power the sacred gear will be able to appear more easily i open my eyes just like riassenpai tells me to flash my left arm glowed whaaaaat what is this what is this can i pull off a kamehameha now the light starts to take form and covers my left arm after the light disappears my left arm is covered in a red gauntlet its equipped with a flashy looking object that looks like a very fine and realistic cosplay item the part that covers the back of my hand has a gemlike object embedded in it actually it looks more like a jewel instead of a gem what the hell is thiiiiiiiis i screamed in complete shock obviously im shocked what is this
i thought i did a kamehameha but instead i got an item on my arm that looks like something someone in henshin heroes would use uwaah what is this thats a sacred gear and it belongs to you once it appears you can use it anywhere and anytime as you wil l tthis red gauntlet is a sacred gear eeeeeeeh i still cant believe it i shot a kamehameha and ii the fallen angel amano yuuma saw your sacred gear as a threat and therefore killed you so the thing about yuuma chan and the sacred gear was all real then the part where i was killed by her was real too so how am i alive you called me when you were on the verge of death i was summoned through this paper riassenpai pulls out a single leaflet i know that leaflet when i was waiting for yuumachan at the meeting spot one of the people there giving out leaflets gave me one its a leaflet with a weird magic circle and a catchphrase that reads your wish will be granted if i look carefully the magic circle on the leaflet is the same as the big magic
circle on the floor this is one of the leaflets we give out this magic circle is used to summon us devils these days there arent many people who would draw this circle to summon us so we give these leaflets to people who look like they would summon devils this magic circle is safe and easy to use that day one of our familiars was disguised as a human and was handing them out in the business district you got it around that time ise after you were attacked by the fallen angel you called me while you were on the verge of death you wished so hard that it summoned me when usually my servants like akeno and the others would be the ones summoned that time i was impaled by the spear of light so i wished really hard when my hand was covered in blood the thing that came to mind was crimson i strongly craved for the girl with crimson hair rias gremory so then the person with red hair that appeared at the end of that dream no the one that appeared at the end of that incident really was senpai when i was
summoned and saw you i knew right away that you were a sacred gear possessor and that you were attacked by a fallen angel but there was a problem ise you were on the brink of death not just devils but humans also die if impaled by a fallen angels spear of light ise you were in that kind of condition so i decided to save your life save my life so senpai was the one who helped me so thats why im alive although as a devil ise you were reborn as a devil of mine rias gremory as my servant pa at that moment wings sprout from the backs of everyone around me theyre different from the black wings of fallen angels their wings are like bat wings pa and with that i also feel some kind of sensation on my back looking over my shoulder i see the same black wings protruding from my back are you kidding me im a devil did i quit being human lets introduce everyone anew yuuto kiba smiles at me after riassenpai calls his name my name is kiba yuuto as yo u already know im a second year like you
hyoudou issei kun umm im a devil too nice to meet you first yeartoujou koneko pleased to make your acquaintanceim a devil too toujou konekochan bows her head my name is himejima akeno and im a third year im also the vice president of this occult research club nice to meet you even though im like this im a devil as well ufufu himejimasenpai bows her head very politely lastly its rias senpai she waves her crimson hair and says very directly and im their master as well as being a devil from the house of gremory rias gremory my house holds the rank of a duke lets get along from now on ise looks like im in a really unbelievable situation life2 i start as a dev il part 1 uooooooooooooooo its midnight and im pedaling my bicycle at full throttle the reason is simple im handing out the leaflets they have an easy to use magic circle on them when humans with strong greed take these in their hands and wish for what they want then we the devils will be summoned before them i then looked at the portable machine in my hand the monitor is displaying
the map of the town im currently in and there are red lights flashing on it im heading to those flashing are as when i arrived at the flashing point which was someones house i put the leaflet inside their mailbox then i moved towards the other flashing points nearby i kept on repeating this procedure over and over again fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck it cant be helped this cant be helped after all im a devil im pedaling along as i scream out loud i think back to the day i found out i was a devil the same day i found out i was a sacred gear possessor that yuumachan was a fallen angel and that riassenpai was a devil by the way my devil wings disappeared immediately after that since theyll become a hindrance to my daily life apparently if i get used to them i can use them to fly but having wings feels really gross though it was a bit of a shocking experience to have wings grow out from my back if you work under me your new life might become very bright you know riassenpai said to me with a wink while im looking down after
i learned i was a devil apparently in exchange for being reincarnated as a devil by riassenpai i have to live on as her servant it seems like thats how it is those who get reincarnated as a devil from being human have to become the servant of the devil who reincarnated them more like this is the rule of the devils what im her servant it might not be that bad to become the servant of a beauty but still i cant agree with it but you know there are ranks among devils called peerage i also have one the place of your birth and your family background plays a big role in it but there are also devils who have risen up everyone starts off as a novice first could you please stop talking like this is some recruiting commercial but are you serious i still cant believe it senpai starts whispering into my ears as im complaining her crimson hair smells so nice it feels like my brain will be paralysed oh is this also a demonic power by the way you might be able to start a life where you can become popular with girls you
know those words started swirling around my mind how before i even could think words spilled out my mouth its my perverted guts its quite remarkable if its this bad wait this may be the work of the demonic power senpai cast onto me even i think i have more anxiety than i usually do the majority of the pure devils were killed in the war that took place a long time ago because of that devils started desperately gathering servants well devils dont have the strength or the influence they originally had when they led their armies even so we need to keep on increasing the number of the devils just like humans the devils are split into genders of male and female and are able to give birth but even with normal birth itll take a lot of time to get back to the same population as before after all devils have a very low birth rate so we wont be able to stand up against the fallen angels so thats why we find humans who seem to have potential and make them into devils as our servants that is so im a servant after all oh dont
make a face like that now ill get to the point since this only increases the number of servants it doesnt increase the number of powerful devils so the devils decided to give an opportunity for power to reincarnated devils those wh o were reincarnated from a human as long as they are powerful because of that there are many devils in human society there are also numerous devils like myself who came to human society as well ise even though you havent realized it im sure youve passed some devils in this town so devils were always nearby then yes though there are humans who can distinguish which ones are devils and those who cant a person with strong greed or a person who wants to get help from devils usually can distinguish us strongly were usually summoned by the ones who can distinguish between them through the leaflet with the magic circle that we give out there are people like you ise who can distinguish devils but dont believe in our existence but a majori ty of them usually believe it if they see our demonic powers what so the reason i summoned senpai was because i had
strong greed looks like theres change in devil society as well it must be difficult but that doesnt matter now the important thing is that theres also a chance for me as well tthen that means i can also get a peerage of my own yes its not impossible of course it would take a lot of time and effort to achieve though uoooooooooooooooooooooooooh i shout inside the clubroom are you serious me im able to make my own harem i i can have sex with them as well right yes i think its fine if its with your servants lightning strikes my body impossible something like that is actually possible in reality an d also as a human its really hard to build your own harem theres no way you can gather herds of girls if youre just ordinary thats because the situation im currently in is bad i dont even have a single girlfriend well i did but she killed me its different now now i can uooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh being a devil rocks hell yeah i cant calm myself down any more i can probably throw away my porno magazine that im secretly hiding i stopped what i was
about to say and th en started thinking about the decision im about to make no not the porno magazine not that i cant throw that away thats my treasure i could still use that until my mum finds out about it this and that are two different issues yeah two differen t issues fufu this boy really is funny riassenpai is laughing as if she finds me really amusing ara ara its just like you said buchou he does make me feel like i have a very idiotic brother now even himejima senpai is laughing with a ufufu ahaha shes kind of saying bad things about me anyways ise youre okay with being my servant right if you have the potential then youll eventually stand out and then you might be able to receive a peerage yes rias senpai wrong youll have to call me buchou buchou cant i call you oneesama i got carried away and asked her i always wanted an onee sama its not even a yuri situation but all guys have a desire to call an older beauty an onee sama riassenpai gave it a serious thought and then shook her head hmm that does
sounds wonderful but since i operate mainly in the school being called buchou has a better ring to it this is the occult research club after all and everyone here also calls me that okay then buchou teach me how to be a devil at my words buchou puts on a devilish smile it seems like shes truly happy fufufu good reply good boy ise okay ill change you into a man buchou starts to touch my chin with her fingers oonee sama its my oneesama ill awaken as a devil while serving under her from now on no ill rise up this should be fine after all i cant revert back to being a human anymore right then ill just have to walk straight ahead ive already accepted the situation im in it might sound stupid but its fine i guess ive already convinced myself its more like my perverted guts are functioning to the max its also because my anxiety is high too im relieved that im a guy who works for his ambition towards sex rather than thinking about this new world i stepped my foot into ill just enjoy my current life im going to become
a harem king if i calmly think back to that day i may have been tricked into this situation by buchous demonic powers well thats oka y i guess were talking about a harem here being able to create one is amazing with this i became a member of the occult research club a few days passed since i became a devil im just pedaling along like crazy in the middle of the night since that day ive become rias buchous servant and ive been working a lot first we gather at the old school building at night this is because we devils can use our power more sufficiently at night the unknown phenomenon that happens to me is the power of a devil since im a devil my power increase during the night its such a wonderful thing but the reason why i feel weak in the morning is also due to me being a devil devils hate light it seems the stronger the power of light is the more lethal it becomes to our bodies lights are poisonous is what buchou told me it seems like the fallen angels and the angels who use light as their weapon
are the natural enemies of devils i was told to run away if i ever encounter them but once you get used to it it seems like youll be okay under the sun the reason why im weak in the morning is because i was recently resurrected as a devil so my body cant stand the morning light it seems like ill get used to it eventually the reason why i was left alone when i was resurrected as a devil was because she wanted me to realize the changes in my body by myself she was planning to tell me the truth and was waiting for the right time that was the day when i was attacked by the guy in the suit so i certainly feel like it was destiny anyways im working hard as rias gremorys servant devil since i just became a devil i was told to study about the devils society and how it works i was ordered to give out these leaflets at night so i can get used to it i thought my parents would get worried if i was gone every night but buchou said with a smile that day i did
everything neccessary when i met your parents so its fine certainly my parents dont get mad when i come home late after finishing my work they j ust say welcome home hmm buchous demonic power is amazing speaking about amazing i was really amazed how much authority buchou has in the academy the academy we go to is buchous territory so thats why shes like the controller of the academy behind the scenes it seems like the one in the highest position in our academy has ties with the devils and therefore cant oppose those from the house of gremory in other words the academy is basically buchous personal belonging thats also the reason w hy were able to enter the school at night and now back to my current work every day i go around on my bicycle posting a leaflet which can summon rias gremorys group inside mailboxes using a mysterious device it seems like the device im holding onto is a secret machine developed with technology from the devils it has the shape of those current portable game devices theres a screen with buttons and its a touch pen type device so it comes with one and
im using the device the way i was told to the monitor displays the map of the town i live in buchous territory each devil is given a certain territory in the human world and they can only do their job within their territory our job is in other words we get summoned make a contract and then grant their wish as a price we receive an award fitting for the particular wish they make it can be money an object and at times even their life well it seems like there arent any contractors wholl go as far as to use their life to make a wish even if there was someone like that it usually gets cancelled since the price doesnt match up to their wish according to buchou peoples values arent equal yup its harsh and the light flashing on the monitor shows the houses where people with a lot of greed live so i go to these areas to hand out the magic circle leaflets as long as there are lights flashing on the monitor my work isnt finished because i turned into a devil other people and even the police dont pay attention to me
humans dont realize my presence when im working ive been pedaling my bicycle every day but the light displayed on the monitor never disappears thats just how much humans continue to have strong greed once you make a wish it apparently becomes an addiction to keep on wishing for other ones making a contract is basically limited to night because devils are only allowed to work at night the daytime is a time for the angels and god which is the part that i still dont understand the leaflets can only be used once so once they use it ill have to hand it out again in other words my work will last forever well thanks to that riasbuchou and the others can continue to be active and we never run out of jobs so were certainly increasing notoriety as devils it seems like well get acknowledged by the king of devils if we keep on making contracts and granting the wishes of humans i see so if i continue working like this then ill be able to receive a peerage from the king so its better to take on bigg er jobs i want it i also want to
make contracts uoooooooooooooooooooh i want to be surrounded by girls as soon as i caaaaan but right now i have to be patient and keep on doing these simple tasks but how long do i have to keep doing this part 2 on a certain day after school i went towards the old school building after splitting apart from my two mates to begin with it seems like my job of handing out the leaflets was originally a job assigned to buchous familiars senpai changes the forms of the mouse and the bat she owns into human forms and makes them hand out the leaflets like i did she says they do this both day and night the reason why i was assigned to do it was because buchou wanted me to know what kind of job devils have to do from the beginning this is something kiba and the others did as well kiba toujou konekochan himejimasenpai are all servant devils of riasbuchou so theyre my seniors so they all have experience in doing the work i did each one of them has a history of doing it ah they arent people but devils it may not be important
but i got an approval from toujou konekochan and himejima senpai to call them koneko chan and akeno san respectively looks like ive gotten one step closer to getting along with them fufufu i purposefully called them by their names in front of matsuda and motohama the looks on their faces was the best i havent told motohama and matsuda about me they wouldnt believe me even if i did and i also think itd be really dangerous for them to step foot into this world i did die once already so i cant drag them into this by the way i still call kiba kiba go die pretty boy ill never call you kiba kun and so today i was called over to the clubroom i went inside the old building that im getting familiar with and headed towards the room on the second floor im coming in when i went inside after saying that everyone was already there oh am i the last one the room was dark and the window was covered to block the light from entering the only light in the room was from the candles spread on the floor so youve come as soon
as buchou confirms that im here she gave an order to akeno san yes buchou ise kun please come to the centre of the magic circle akenosan motioned for me to come with her hand a beautys waving her hand at me thank you very much that alone is a reward for me i walked to the centre of the circle so what now ise your work of giving out the leaflets is over well done buchous smi ling i see so im done with handing out leaflets now ill have you do a devils acutal job oh now i can make contracts yes thats right though since its your first time its going to be a contract with someone who wants to make a small wish koneko has two reservation contracts so since its hard to do both ill leave one to you please help me out konekochan bows her head so im going on behalf of koneko chan thats okay i was getting tired of handing out the leaflets unexpectedly pedaling a bicycle every night and handing out the leaflets made me lonely the other members are outside the circle akenosan who is inside the circle is casting
something then the magic circle starts emitting blue and white lights uumm keep quiet ise akeno is currently inserting your carved seal into the magic circle buchou says my carved seal it seems like the magic circle inside this room represents the gremory i was told that for us servant devils of buchou its something lik e a family crest so for people who are trying to summon us and for people who want to make a contract with us this sign represents our symbol so the activation of the socalled demonic power is related to this kiba and the others have these signs on their bodies in different sizes and it operates whenever they use their demonic powers is what i was told i thought about getting engraved with the same signs but it seems like you have to learn how to control your demonic powers beforehand and then use demonic power which creates natural phenomenon by coordinating it through the magic circle after that well thats what i thought ise put your palm towards here i put my left hand towards buchou just like she said buchou writes something on my palm with her fingers is she writing
a charm it feels like shes drawing something like a circle then my palm glows theres a circular symbol a magic circle engraved in my hand its glowing blue and white wow a magic circle this allows you to tran sport to the clients place instantly by making you go through the teleportation type magic circle and when the contract is done it lets you return to this room oh i get it now so thats its ability akeno are you ready yes buchou akenosan steps out of the magic circle now stand in the centre i stand in the centre of the magic circle like she urged me to then the magic circle starts to emit a stronger glow somehow i can feel power coming from it when im touching this magic circle th e power inside me is flowing out so is this the trait for being a part of the group the magic circle is responding to the client so youll be teleported there now you already have the manual for what to do after getting teleported right yes good response now get going im getting hyped my first job im definitely going to accomplish it safely
the magic circle starts to glow even stronger it looks like im getting instantly teleported there theres many lights covering my body which caused me to close my eyes due to the brightness next time i open my eyes ill be at the clients place kuu im looking forward to this and then i instantly teleported hm hmm huh have i teleported is it done i timidly open my eyes im speec hless from where i am its the club room huh what about the instant teleportation wheres the client when i look buchou seems to be troubled and puts her hand on her forehead akeno san says ara ara with a disappointed face that bastard kiba is sighing he pisses me off but did something happen to me ise buchou calls my name yes its unfortunate but it seems like you cant use the magic circle to get transported to the clients location huh what does that mean i put on a puzzled expression and senpai explains it to me a magic circle requires a certain amount of demonic powerquite little actually in fact its a feat that could be done by any devil even children transportation through the
magic circle is the first and the easie st step of being a devil wwhat does that mean in other words ise your demonic powers are below that of children no its so low that the magic circle cant even respond to it ise your demonic power is incredibly low wha whaaaaaaaaaat wwhat the heeeeeeeeeeell i was speechless eeeeeh so that means that i cant use the magic circle to teleport to the clients location because i dont have demonic powers arent i a devil im a devil right unsightly konekochan says expressionlessly that really hurts konekochan ara ara were in trouble what should we do buchou akenosan also has a troubled face and asks buchou uggh my debut as a devil is off to a rough start then after thinking for a while buchou tells me clearly since theres a client we cant let him wait ise yes this has never happened before but youll have to go there on foot by myself im in shock i wasnt predicting that buchou sama yes just like how you handed out the leaflets youll have to go to the clients house by bicycle this cant be helped you dont have any
demonic powers after all youll have to make up for that with your own body on a bicycle ill have to go to the clients place on a bicycle are there even devils like that point konekochan silently points at me konekochaaaaaan you sure like to make me feel miserable huh hurry and get going its a devils job to make contracts you cant make humans wait buchou urges me on with a serious face ugggh my goal for getting a peerage starts from a bumpy road uuwaaaaaah ill do my best i left the club room in tears part 3 its midnight and i was peddling my bicycle at maximum speed my eyes are covered with tears im crying yeah im crying a devil who cant get summoned through a magic circle that will be me apparently this is the first case ever ladies thanks to that my tears arent stopping what does she mean that i dont have demonic powers dammit will i actually be able to get a peerage at this rate using the devils portable device im peddling my bicycle towards the person who called me its an apartment located 20 minutes away from the school
the client is in one of those rooms if its a delivery service customers will get mad beca use of the late delivery its usually instant teleportation but i made the client wait for 20 minutes if you are working in a store then your manager will be mad at you my manager was troubled when i did that did i leave a bad impression on him hmm living as a devil sure is hard i knock on the door good evening im an errand from the devil gremory sama excuse me but this is the house that summoned us right it should be okay with this devils can only be sensed by humans who want to make contracts even if i do something like this at middle of the night the neighbours wont know whats going on it seems like only the client can hear what i just said during the time when we are doing our job as a devil a special demonic power gets activated and it wont cause trouble to those who isnt involved in it thats what buchou told me wwhos there what i heard is a voice of panicked man umm im a devil
im a newbie and i came here because i was called by you ddont lie there isnt an y devil that knocks on doors devils come out from this leaflet thats how it was for the past summoning and the one i called for is koneko chan yeah hes right i will apologise for that im sorry its also an unexpected incident for me and the oth ers ah im sorry it seems like i dont have enough demonic powers so i cant appear from the magic circle you might just be a pervert i got pissed off as soon as he said that im not a pervert and how should i know if i could i also wanted t o appear through the magic circle what kind of loner would peddle their bicycle through the town in middle of the night why are you the one getting pissed you super pervert super pervert fuck you im telling you that im a devil go home the client opens his door the client complains hes a skinny man he looks unhealthy he looks angry but as soon as he looks at my face his expression softens are you crying eh me
when i put my hand on my cheek tears is on my hand im crying is that so so you were shocked to find out that you cant teleport through the magic circle looks like it i was allowed to come into his room he even made tea for me the incident about the teleportation and the argument earlier crushed my heart more than i expected and unconsciously i was crying of course i want to cry the client morisawasan who saw that allowed me to come inside his room after feeling sorry for me his room looks clean its a tidy room for a single guy like him to live in he told me that he works for the government during the day morisawasan does his job seriously but he was craving to get in touch with other people so he ended up summoning devils from that leaflet so its not koneko chan he fell in love with kone kochan at first sight who was the first devil he made contract with and since then he has been summoning her im sorry but apparently that girl is popular with other clients as well it seems like she is in
charge of the cuteness department when you summon a devil you can wish for which devil to summon by calling out that devils name well thats how it was explained to me and today koneko chans job was passed to me there are cases when the devil they chose cant be summoned so another devil goes as their substitute i wished for a devil from the cuteness category when i used the leaflet im a cute newbie so can you be okay with that hahaha you talk of something impossible if i had a silver sword with me i would have stabbed you oniisan you are laughing but your eyes looks serious by the way what were you going to wish for when you tried to summon koneko chan that is my question maybe i can also grant that wish of his but that is instantly shattered when morisawasan took out a certain thing from the corner of his room i wanted her to wear this which girls school uniform is that from i think i have seen it somewhere before or maybe i havent its the uniform of nagato yuki10 nagatoah from suzumiya haruhi even i know it suzumiya
haruhi series11 it was a popular anime last year devil kun do you also like nagato no im more of an asakura ryouko fan12 and your reason her breasts morisawasan lost his word when he heard me reply without a second thought asakura ryouko a regular character from suzumiya haruhi series and a beautiful girl with a glamorous body so you are a big breasts lover yes oppai are packed with dreams that i am very sure of i then imagine buchous naked breasts bouncing buchou ive fallen in love with your oppai at first sight i was too embarrassed to say it in front of you but i will definitely protect your oppai buchou morisawasan makes a lecherous expression while smirking you have good eyes seems like you have an extremely high passion towards oppai i see so you have an opposite fetish as me i like small breaste d girls i can understand that i have a friend with the same taste the guy that appears to my mind is my evil buddy who wears glasses motohama he is a genuine pervert that i am very sure of yes dont you think she koneko chan looks similar to
nagato for example her atmosphere though shes a bit short when you say it like that konekochan has a small body she shows no expression she has a body with no curves her hair is short and so they do seem similar nagato yuki is also a character like that thats why i wanted her to wear this i really wanted her to wear it morisawasan shed tears of regret he sure is regretting it he really wanted her to wear it huh im sorry about it okay then let me wear it ill fucking kill you bastard morisawa san turns down my kind offer while shouting please dont get mad while crying out that much its a joke i m just kidding morisawasan tries to calm down after whipping off his tears he takes a deep breath and calms down well nev er mind so what is your special skill you are a devil so you should be good at something right something like using a mysterious power just to tell you koneko chan has extreme strength she carried me like a princess morisawasan says it with pride where has your pride as a man gone off to yeah
there must be people who get all high by being lifted up by a girl but my special trait hmm i crossed my arm and then say it seriously my special skill is kamehameha13 go kill yourself what whats with that response you shouldnt say that right away and your words had so much killing intent in it of course i am in what kind of world is there a devil that has kamehameha as his special skill here right here i said it strongly while pointing it myself then do it i will if you can shoot it then shoot dont look down on us the generation who grew up with dragon ball when we were in junior school all of us practiced doing kamehameha during break every monday we even tried to collect spirits so we could use the genkidama though nothing happened dont look down on our generation14 15 shut up so who cares if you were raised while watching dragon ball i have all of the manga volumes i even bought the special cover version in first print as well me and my mates also played hide and seek by using ki i talked back to
all of his argument im pissed yeah im really pissed then ill show you hyoudou isseis version of kamehameha i activate my sacred gear first i close my eyes and then put my left arm upwards i then imagine son goku in my headand put my arm down while making a pos e of doing a kamehameha16 i put all my energy in it shit take this you dragon ball generation this is my ultimate attack kamehameha flash instantly my left arm glows the sacred gear a red gauntlet appears while covering my left arm hows that this is my sacred gear flow i then look at morisawasan and he is crying hard he then grabs volume 1 of dragon ball from his bookshelf he grabs my hand and we exchanged a passionate handshake lets talk about it flow tears are also flowing out of my eyes thats enough to understand what he is trying to say any dragon ball fan will understand what he is trying to say yes lets talk about it so the long night starts hahaha me too i also think it was good that wakamoto san17 voiced ce ll18 as well yeah it sounded just
like how i imagined it to be after he got his manga weve been laughing and talking f or the past 2 hours as we talk we forgot the age gap between us and have already became friends fufufu he had a bad first impression but when we started talking we realised we can get along okay maybe i should make a contract with you as well yeah president thank you for the contract yes yes yes yes yes ive gotten my first contract my road to getting a peerage has started my legend starts from here okay it might be a standard wish but can i wish to become rich i see that is indeed a normal but a popular wish people would ask okay ill check i turned on the portable device for devils and operated it when i input his wish the answer appears ah umm in your case for you to fulfil that wish your price would be your life s o you will die die yes in the devils world they say that individuals life isnt equal im sorry so for you to wish becoming rich morisawa san you would have to die it feels
like i just got my heart ripped out but thats okay anyway if i make that wish where will i die umm ah you will die as soon as the money starts dropping from the sky looks like you cant even touch it this is awful guha so i cant smack the money onto your face then hey dont try to hit me with it yeah i just witnessed someones dream getting crushed i see like i thought making a wish like that is basically near impossible for morisawasan so this is what buchou means that peoples value isnt equal what an unfair world we live in tthen how about a harem how about wishing for lots of girls in a sumptuous feast oh so you will go there huh im a bit moved hes a guy after all of course he will wish for something like that morisawa san i also love harems its every mans dream af ter all amazing i think i can enjoy drinking alcohol with you one day even though im a minor i dont care about that so what does it say i input his wish in the device oh my thats a harsh
answer well it says that you would die as soon as th e beautiful woman and girls come into your sight im going to die just by seeing them no it says as soon as they come into your sight so you wont be able to tell whether they are beautiful or not thats harsh isnt it better to walk past beauti ful girls in the city uuwaaaaaaaaaaaah suddenly morisawasan who is an adult starts to cry so i was a human who didnt have much worth uggh i can only say im sorry for being born i pat softly on morisawa sans shoulder lets continue talk ing about dragon ball till morning you want to battleplay dragon ball i will be goku and you can be freeza is that okay morisawasan nods his head while crying like this my first contract became invalid because i have to take care of my client part 4 next day after school buchou is angry shes lifting her eyebrow and she didnt say a single word im standing in front of her and my face is pale yesterday i was playing dragon ball with my client and finished the night with it oh
yeah kiba said something like this with a bitter smile earlier this kind of case has never happened before ise the tone of her voice is deep and scary yes you talked with the client about manga and what happened after that what about the contract she came straight to the point i have sweats coming out of me tthe contract became invalid we battled played a certain manga till morning battle play yyes you act as a character from that a specific manga and then start an imagination figh t why am i explaining something like this so seriously explaining this to her is making me want to cry ii know that as a high school boy i should be embarrassed no as a professional devil i should be also embarrassed i im regretting it im very sorry i bow down my head while apologising seriously what on earth was i doing till morning after the contract we ask the client to fill in the questionnaire on the leaflet we gave them we ask the client how was your contract with a devil t he questionnaire which is filled appears in this leaflet but buchou shows the paper with
the feedback for the questionnaire to me so theres a thing like that huh devils job are more complex than i thought it was fun it was my first time havin g a good time like this i would like to meet with ise kun again i hope i can make a good contract with him next time this is the questionnaire filled by the client my chest became hot morisawa san i wasnt able to do anything but you this is the first time i received a feedback like this i wasnt sure what to do first thats why i put on a weird expression because i didnt know how to react to this buchou isnt mad but its true that i didnt make a contract to devils whats import ant is that we actually make a contract with humans who summoned us we then receive the price from them thats how devils have lived for a long time ago i didnt know how to react because this is the first time i encountered an incident like this you might have failed as a devil but the client was happy with you buchou has a puzzled expression but she
then smiles but its interesting that is certain there wasnt any devil like you but you really are an interesting boy you might become the number 1 devil for unexpected things but remember to do the basics you make contracts with the clients you grant their wish and then you receive the price okay yes ill do my best buchou forgives my actions that alone makes me so happy that i feel like dancing buchou next time ill definitely do it part 5 at night after i made a vow once again im doing my job im on full throttle peddling my bicycle towards the clients house at night this time im heading towards a mansion that is 30 min utes away from the school it took me 30 minutes to reach even though i was going at full speed the client isnt pissed right i stand front of the door and rang the bell a devil who has to ring the door bell truly is saddening i also want to get summoned through the magic circle soon then after a short time there is a reply through the interphone its opened come in nyou its really a thick voice
its a guy huh nyou did he just say nyou no it must be my ears i open the door took off my shoes at the entrance and walk timidly into the mansion the moment i open the door i became speechless welcome nyou a humongous body and an overwhelming presence its an enormous guy with incredible muscles wearing a gothic lolita outfit if i look carefully the buttons on the outfit looks like they are about to fall off there also some places in his outfit which looks like its about to get ripped more than that his eyes are filled with overwhelming killing intent but his eyes have a glow of a pure innocent person no the most unusual thing is his head he has catears i swallow down my spit a single sweat drops from my cheek my hands are shaking because im getting nervous this isnt a man he is a man among all men an overwhelming presence and the sense of being in danger i have a hunch a hunch that i will be killed in an unreasonable death uumma devildid you summon a devil from the gremory group i ask him timidly flash the
mans eye glows while making sound effect it feels like there is intense battle spirit between us im going to get killeeed hii even though im a devil i changed my posture to protect myself thats right nyou i called devilsan because i want to make a wish nyou unexpected words came out from his thick mouth he ends his sentences with nyou impossibleis he even allowed to do that i want you to make mil tan a magical girl nyou please teleport to another world then i give him my answer right away its impossible thats really impossible seriously i hold my head down because of his wish is something beyond what i expected miltan what the heck is miltan this mans words starts to confuse me with that body of yours you can go to another dimension and return back here alive you can probably defeat satan as well i already tried that nyou you actually tried it but it was impossible nyou there was noone who would give miltan magical powers nyou well you can say that this situation is kind of magical the only option left is to ask my archenemy devilsan nyou i already have
myself treated as his enemy without realising it but i wont say anything to him devil san the voice released by this man miltan shakes the whole room what is this sound magic please give miltan a fantasylike powers nyoooooou dont worry you look fantasy like enough im the one who feels like crying i start to cry for real dammit how come all the clients im in charge of are bunch of perverts whats the meaning of this mil tan mil tan calm down i will listen to what you have to say first things first i think i need to calm this man down and listen to his story miltan puts on a big smile with his scary face after he wipes his tears then lets watch magical girl milky spiral 7 alternative together nyou the story about the magic starts from there nyou my long night has begun part 6 its already the next day and im on my way home after the regular club activity ended haa i made a sigh even today buchou put on a weird expression my contract became invalid twice in a row but i got the best feedback buchou became confused
again because she encountered an incident that she never has experienced twice in a row im sorry for getting involved in a weird situation i feel bad but it seems like my road to getting a peerage will be harder than i thought last night i watched the anime dvd till morning with miltan at first i wasnt serious in watching it but i got hooked to the magi cal girl anime due its hot actions and the story which made me cry so i ended up watching till morning besides that why are all of my clients a bunch of perverts ahaha hyoudou kun must have a demonic power that attracts people like that kiba said something like that to me earlier with his refreshing smile die handsome i hear that the chances of him being summoned by beautiful older woman is high dammit what kind of contract does he have with them is it sex or sex related just thinking about it makes me want to murder him shit damn you kibaaaa hawaau hmm a sudden voice at the same time i heard the voice from behind me there is also a sound of something dropping on the
ground when i turned around there is a sister who is on the floor she is spreading her arms wide open and has her face on the ground that certainly is a clumsy way of falling down a are you okay i approach the sister and give her my hand so she can stand up auu why do i keep on tripping over oh im sorry thank you very much judging from her voice she is young is she the same age as me i take her hand to lift her up wind blows the sisters veil flies off because of the wind her blonde hair which is hidden underneath falls down onto her shoulders her straight blonde hair is sparkling with light because of the sunshine then my eyes move towards her face my heart is taken by her instantly a blonde hair beauty is standing front of me both of her green eyes look so bea utiful that it feels i will be sucked into it for a while i was gazing at her uummis something wrong the sister looks directly into my face with a worried expression ah s sorry umm i cant say it theres no
way that i can tell her i was fascinated with her rather this girl is it yeah im talking about that yes that she looks exactly like my ideal girl blonde beauty version of course i would be attracted to her it feels like i need to continue talking to her is this is a flag im thinking something selfish like that then the travelling bag she is carrying on her shoulder appears to my eyes if i think about it its a rare occasion to see a nun in a town its my first time seeing one before that i need to pick up her veil luckily it landed nearby ttraveling no thats not it i was appointed to the church in this town you must be a resident of this town its a pleasure to meet you she bows her head hmmm getting placed in the church of this town staff reassignment looks like the church is also having a tough time i have been in trouble since i got here ummmi cant speak japanese that welli was lost and other people couldnt understand what i was saying she holds her hand together in front of her chest
and looks really sad so that means this person cant speak japanese the reason why she can speak with me is because this is the power of a devil thats what buchou told me before when you turn into a devil one of the unique ability you attain is language the moment you turn into a devil everyone in the world can understand what you are saying people listening to you will hear it in the language they are most familiar with if they are american then they will hear it in english if they are spanish then they will hear it in spanish and also the opposite if they speak in a language besides japanese you will hear it in japanese yeah its happening just like buchou said during the english lecture i heard everything in japanese i was shocked when i was told to read an english paragraph by the english teacher i somehow read it and all of my classmates looked shocked of course they would since i can speak english naturally now so obviously my classmates will be shocked even the teacher froze because of it well the letters and vocabulary didnt change to japanese because
its limited to sound only but thats good enough its too amazing if i can exchange language anywhere in the world just like that i turned into an international high school student without any requirements i think i might know where the church is i think there is an old church in the outer part of this town i think its that church but is that church still even used yyou do tthank you this is all thanks to god she smiles at me with tears flowing from her eyes this girl is really cute but when i look at the rosario glowing from her chest it gives me an extremely negative reaction well of course it does since im a devil she is the type of human that i shouldnt talk to or get involved with but i cant leave a girl in trouble alone like this i took this sister to the church on our way to the church we went past a park uwaaaaaah what i heard was the cry of a boy are you alright yosh kun he will be fine since he is with his mum it seems like he just tripped over but suddenly
the sister who is walking behind me walks towards the park hey sister went inside the park and went towards the boy who is sitting down and crying i also followed the sister are you okay boys shouldnt cry with a minor injury like this sister pats the boys head gently the boy probably didnt understand what she is saying but the sister has a very kind expression the sister put her palm where the boy has injured himself next moment i was in shock a green light orb appears from the sisters palm and is flashing onto the boys knee whats that demonic powers buchou said that it can only be used by devils and someone related to devils so it cant be when i look carefully the boys injury starts to disappear is the light from her hand healing the boys injury something appears on my mind sacred gear a special power which is bestowed upon certain people i think thats what kiba said before i somehow feel this is it as well looking at that light makes my left arm ache this has to be related did my sacred gear react with her sacred gear is it
responding to it when i look again the boys injury is gone and there isnt even a trace le ft amazing this is also the power of a sacred gear there are so many different types of it the boys mother is in shock anyone who sees unimaginable things will have a similar reaction here your wounds are healed the pain should be gone now the sister pats the boys head and looks at me im sorry but i had to she laughs while sticking her tongue out the boys mother who was shocked before shook her head then grabs the boys hand so they can leave quickly thank you onee chan the boy s words words of gratitude he said thank you onee chan she smiles happily after i translated for her that power yes its the power to heal its a wonderful power that god gave me she looks a bit sad even though shes smiling somehow it seems like she has some dark past or something i probably shouldnt get too deep into it its not the atmosphere where i should say actually i have a sacred gear as well its an unusual power and maybe some
people may suffer because of it even i d idnt feel happy when my sacred gear was covering my arm instead i was really shocked i still didnt know how to use this sacred gear therefore i wasnt happy at all the only thing i can use it for is to mimic kamehameha the conversation ends there and we continued walking towards the church we reached an old church after walking for a few minutes yeah the only church i know is this its just as old as i remember i never heard that this place is still being used but you can see the light inside the church so that means that there are people inside chills chills chills i have chills and sweats are coming out of my body its been like this since before i knew it im a devil so the church which belongs to the god and the angels will be an enemys territory for me even buchou said that i should never get close to a church or a shrine very strongly yes this is the place im so glad sister shows a sigh of relief after having compared our location with the map
she has oh so this is the right place thats good i shouldnt stay here any longer its getting dark so i should be going now its a waste to say good bye to a beauty like her but im a devil and she is a nun love between different sides may sound romantic but this would be a different case thats because im getting really scared of the church my whole body wont stop shaking this sign of fear must be a special trait for devils it feels like im a frog being watched by a snake no rather im a frog who doesnt know wh at to do after being found by the snake then ill be on my way please wait i say my farewell and tried to leave but the sisters words stops me i would like to make you some tea as a gratitude for taking me here oh im in a rush so i have to get going but thats shes troubled she probably wants to make me some tea to show her gratitude but drinking tea here will be dangerous its a shame but i have to refuse my name is hyoudou issei
everyone around me calls me ise so you can c all me ise as well whats your name when i give her my name she responds with a smile my name is asia argento please call me asia then sister asia lets meet again yes ise san i will definitely come and see you asia bows her head down i left the place after waving my hands towards her she watched me until i was out of her sight i understood that she is a good girl and this was our fateful destiny and our first meeting part 7 at night dont ever get close to the church again im being scolded by buchou in the club room buchous expression looks more serious than usual more like she is really mad at me to us devils the church is an enemys territory just stepping into it can cause a rift between the devils and god since it was an act of kindness by taking the nun to the church they didnt harm you but the angels are always on the lookout you were in a situation where it wouldnt be strange for them to hit you with a spear of
light are you serious was i in such a serio us situation if i think about it the chills i felt before wasnt normal i only felt fear at that time so thats what it means to detect danger so my instinct as a devil was telling me that it was a dangerous situation dont get involved with peopl e from the church especially the exorcists who are our biggest enemy they could easily eliminate us because their powers are supported by the prayer of god more so if it is an exorcist with a sacred gear that would be the same as standing on the bounda ry of death ise buchou looks at me directly with her blue eyes while waving her crimson hair her eye is serious the other eye is kind of okay with it but that one eye is really serious so she isnt joking yyes you could avoid death as a human by being resurrected as a devil but devils who are exorcised become completely terminated they return to nothing nothing there is nothing left and you feel nothing do you know how serious that is nothing to tell you the truth i dont buchou
shakes her head after seeing my confused face im sorry i got too heated anyway be careful from now on yes my conversation with buchou ends there ara ara did you finish lecturing him owaa akeno san is standing behind me and i didnt even re alise it she is smiling like usual akeno did something happen akeno sans expression changes after buchou asks her we received an order for a hunt from the arch duke part 8 stray devils there are beings that are called as such the devil who was turned into a servant devil of a devil with a peerage but who betrayed or killed its master cases like that rarely occur the power of devils are enormous you cant even compare it to the time when you were a human so there will be those who choose to use that power for their own selfinterests those devils leave their masters place and cause destruction at different location that is a stray devil the fallen angel donaseek who wore a suit mistook me for a stray devil in other words a stray dog stray dogs create troubles when found the master or the other devils are ordered
to eliminate them that is the law of the devils other beings such as angels and fallen angels sees them as threats and they will eliminate the stray devils whenever foun d there is nothing scarier than a devil who does not abide by any rule i went to the unused building located at the outer part of the town along with buchou akenosan kiba and konekochan every night a stray devil is luring humans to the building to feed on them as such there was a request from the highclass devil to hunt them since it has escaped to the territory of rias gremory i would like to ask you to eliminate it apparently this is also one of the jobs of a devil eating a human there are evil devils like that as well no naturally devils are like that so the only reason they are quiet is because they abide by the law yeah they are devils after all its midnight its a world of darkness theres lot of tall grasses surrounding me and i can see the unused building far away from here its one of the devils traits to have a clear view at night
hmm having a clear view of a creepy place like this isnt so good smell of blood konekochan covers her nose with her uniform after she says that smell of blood i cant smell anything so it means koneko chan has a good sense of smell it becomes quiet i can feel the presence of an enemy nearby and its intent to kill us isnt normal my legs are shaking im really scared if the others werent here i will have escaped buchou who is up at the front putting her hands on her hips looks very reliable ise its a good opportunity to experience what its like to fight buchou says something reckless wait are you serious im positive that i wont be of much use yes its still impossible now she says it straight at me i kind of feel sad but you can watch what a devils battle is like today just concentrate and look at how we fight oh yes i will also explain the traits the servants have explain the traits servants have i put on a confused look but buchou continues devils who are the master give traits to those who will become their
servants yes its probably about time i explain about it and als o about the history of devils buchou starts to explain about the current situation of the devils long time ago there was a three sided war between the devils the fallen angels and god with its angels followers all three sides had a large army and they fought for almost eternity as a result all three sides lost most of their troops and the war finished several hundred years ago with no side winning kiba continues after buchou the devils were no exception big devils with peerage who commanded a bout 20 or 30 troops lost most of their underlings because of the war they lost so many that they couldnt even form new armies akenosan continues on from there i heard that most of the pure devils passed away in that war even after the war there are still problems between the devils the fallen angels and god even though the fallen angels and gods side also lost most of their troops we are still in a position where we cant let our guard down or else we will be in trouble then buchou speaks again then
the devils decided to use a system to form a small group of soldiers and that is the evil piece evil piece seems like its going to get complicated but it looks like i have to listen to it seriously devils with peerage decide to use the traits of the humans game chess to their servant devils it was also sarcasm because most of the servants are devils that were reincarnated from humans since then chess became a popular game in the world of the devils well leave that aside devils who are masters are a king in our case that is me from there they created 5 special traits that consist of queen knight rook bishop and pawn since they couldnt make an army they decided to have a small number of devils and give them enormous powers this system was made in the past few hundred years and this unexpectedly became popular amongst devils with peerage popular you mean the chess rule they started to compete against each other for example like my knight is stronger or no my rook is stronger as a result high class devils started to play a game like that of chess against
each other using their servant devils we call it the rating game anyway this game became very popular amongst the devils now there are even tournaments for it the strength of their pieces and also how strong they are at the game affects the devils social position and their peerage there is a thing called piece collect where they gather humans with talents and make them into their pieces its very popular recently talented servants become their status i see so being strong in that game means that you are a splendid devil it also becomes your pride then umm so servant devils are former humans and they function by becoming the pieces in the game i feel its complicated so will i be someday forced to fight in that game im not a matured devil yet so i cant participate in the official tournament even if i could there are things that i need to go through or else i cant play in short ise and my other servants here wont be participating in a game for a while so does that mean that kiba and the others havent played in that game yet yeah kiba answers my question
the world of devils is strange i used to imagine them being evil and scary but it looks like my imagination is incorrect or maybe i feel like that because im still ignorant of the ways of the devils world before that there is something that is bothering me yeah my position is a piece buchou what is my role and traits and what piece am i ise you are buchou stops there i also know the reason why i can feel chills all over my body thats because of the presence of the enemy and its intent to kill became much stronger there is something approaching us even a guy like me who just turned into a devil knows it i can smell something disgusting but i can also smell something delicious is it sweet or is it sour a low voice which is coming from below the ground this weird ness isnt normal just hearing its voice scares me stray devil vaizor we are here to eliminate you buchou says that ketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketaketa the abnormal laughter echoes around us ah i now clearly understand this isnt a laugh of a human its also not a laugh of a devil
that i know of nggh a topless woman appears from the shadow but the womans body is floating no step a heavy footsteps the next thing that appears is the body of a gigantic beast its a grotesque being with an unnatural form having a womans upper body and the lower body of a monster its holding something that looks like a spear in both of its hands the lower body of the monster has four fat legs with sharp claws is it a snake tail wow the tail is moving on its own from the size of it its definitely more than 5 meters tall if it stands on its hind legs wont it be much taller either way its a monster is this also a devil well duh since buchou called it a stray devil man there are things like this as well i confirmed it again devils are scary leaving your masters side and rampaging as you please definitely deserve death in the name of duke gremory i will gladly eliminate you you are cunning for a littl e girrrrrrl i will rip your body and colour it in red just like your haaaaaaair the monster barks
but buchou just laughs with her nose grunts sure do speak in a stylish manner yuuto yes swoof kiba who was near me sprints ahead as soon as buchou gives him an order fast hes insanely fast i cant even respond to it ise i will continue from the lecture before buchou says lecture the thing about evil pieces traits or something yuutos position is knight its trait is speed those who become a knight have their speed increased just like buchou said kibas speed increases and eventually i wasnt able to follow his movements with my eyes the monster is using its spear to attack but it didnt seem like it will hit and yuutos ultimate weapon is swords kiba stops and suddenly he is holding onto a european sword he took it out of the scabbard and the drawn sword is reflecting the light of the moon su kiba suddenly disappears again next moment the scream of the monster echoes gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah when i looked both of its arms are cut from its torso along with the spear blood gushes out of its wound this is yuutos power speed that you cant follow with your eyes and sword skills
of a professional by combining th ese two he becomes the fastest knight there is a shadow near the monsters legs wait thats koneko chan next is koneko she is a rook the trait of a rook is its damn inseeeeeeeeect stomp the enormous monster tries to stomp on konekochan kkoneko chan hey shes in trouble but the monsters foot didnt hit the ground it wasnt able to stomp completely gugugu the girl with a tiny body is lifting up the monsters foot the trait of a rook is simple absolute strength and also very high defence its impossible for a devil with that calibre to stamp on koneko it cant crush her lift konekochan completely lifts up the monster fly koneko chan jumps high and punches into the monsters stomach very sharply bang the enormous body of the monster gets thrown backwards i then remembered the word of the client that loves konekochan morisawasan konekochan has extreme strength she carried me like a princess its not something you call extreme strength that enormous monster went flying with just one punch yeah i will make sure not to mess with konekochan i will probably get killed just by getting poked
by her finger superhuman girl scary indeed morisawasan who fell in love with her is also scary lastly akeno yes buchou ara ara what should i do akenosan is laughing while walking towards the monster that is on the ground after being hit by konekochan akeno is a queen shes the one who is the strongest after me she is the unbeatable vicepresident of our club who has all the traits of pawn knight bishop and rook guuuuuu the monster stares at akenosan akenosan makes a fearless laugh after seeing the monsters gaze ara ara seems like you still have some energy left in you then how about this akenosan puts her hands towards the sky flash next instant the sky sparkles and a lightning bolt strikes down the monster gagagagagagagagagagagagaaa the monster gets electrified violently its entire body gets burnt and smoke are coming out from it ara ara looks like you still have some energy in you looks like you can take more flash another lightning bolt hit the monster gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaah the monster gets electrified again it already sounds like its dying even so akenosan strikes down the third lightning akenosans face while striking down the lightning bolt
looks scary and cold even though she is smiling uwaah that person is enjoying it shes laughing after all akeno excels at attacks using demonic powers she could use natural elements like lightning ice and fire and most of all she is the ultimate sadist buchou confesses it like if its nothing a sadist thats not something you call a sadist usually shes very kind but once the battle starts she wont stop until she calms down uuu im scared of akeno san you dont have to be afraid ise akeno is very kind to comrades so its not a problem she even said that you were cute next time get spoiled by her she wi ll definitely hug you kindly ufufufufufufufu how much of my lightning can you take right monster san you still cant die yet okay the one who finishes you off will be my master ohohohohohohoho buchou im getting very scared of the person in front of me who is laughing very loudly i thought she was the one with the most common sense she is a devil after all that has to be it a devil i tell ya so they will be scary for
a few minutes akeno sans lightning attacks continues after akenosan calms down buchou confirms it and nods her head buchou approaches the monster that has already lost its will to fight buchou put her hand towards the monster any last words buchou asks kill me thats the only thing the monster says then disappear a cruel reply buchous voice gave me the chills don a gigantic black mass of demonic power is shot out from buchous palm its so big that it can cover all of the monsters body the mass of demonic power devours the monsters body when th e demonic power disappears so did the monsters body just like buchou said it disappeared confirming that buchou makes a sigh its over good work everyone buchou says it to the club members everyone returns back to their usual self so the stray devil hunt is over huh the fate for the stray devils i dont know what to say that thing also left its masters side because it had something in its mind so this is the battle of a devil it was a fierce fight along with the stray devils there are still many things in this world
i am unfamiliar with so i have to aim up high from here maybe i have to think in decades then i remembered the problem the thing about position of evil pieces from earlier since im a servant of a devil with peerag e then i should have a certain piece too buchou there is still a thing that you didnt tell me what is it buchou responds with a smile my piecemore like what is my role as a servant to tell you the truth i already predicted the worst case more like i knew it is that but i still have a naive hope there are two pieces left since akenosan is a queen konekochan is a rook and kiba is a knight the bishop andthe pawn i was hoping for it but it gets shattered instantly the crimsonhair beauty smiles at me and says it clearly you are a pawn ise you are a pawn im the lowest life3 i made a friend part 1 haa the road to achieving a successful career sure is hard im in my room looking at the ceiling and making a fuss pawn thats my trait and role a pawn thats
the lowest role so i have to aim up from there my road to getting a peerage starts by getting onto a rough road my road to become a proper devil is full of troubles by the way there is someone else who is buchous bishop she told me this on the same day when i found out my role as a servant my bishop already exists but that bishop is not here the bishop is at a different place following a different order working for me if there is a chance then i will introduce the bishop to you thats what she said who is that person maybe i could meet that person soon i hope its a girl so i was chosen as the left over pawn i have many difficulties to overcome when i think about it was i actually okay with this i was killed by a fallen angel because of the kamehameha equipping device the sacred gear she also used my feelings of love then after that i was turned into a devil i was picked up by a beautiful devil who s aid to me that i was her servant and then was deceived
that i can make my own harem if i rise up i work my butt off every day as buchous servant handing out leaflets and making contracts but my demonic power is low so i cant use the magic circle to get teleported to the clients place something like this has never happened before the worst devil ever thats me breathes in i inhaled some air if i think about it i never had any special features even before i turned into a devil i tried a lo t of things to become popular with the girls but after all i cant win against good looking guys i also didnt have any dreams before i turned into a devil well maybe thats a good thing that i turned into a devil because i have a dream now wait is turning into a devil even a good thing well if i havent been saved by buchou back then my life would have been over just like this i dont have time to enjoy my youth well its kindafun im surrounded by a bunch of bishojous and everyone is kind well for a devil that is riasbuchou is beautiful and akeno san
is okay as long as i dont piss her offi think koneko chan also isnt a problem as long as i act normal kiba pisses me off but he talks to me normally even though hes a good looking guy hes actually a good guy damn good looking guy you really cant judge people by their appearance looks like my imagination of a good looking guy is changing then i remembered about the beautiful blonde sister asia she was a beautiful girl if i was to have a girlfriendi stop there and covered my face wait i just went through that rough unrequited love damn it playing with my feelings yuuma chan i actually loved you shit why is my life always controlled by someone else maybe thats how life works a lot of mysterious things happen around me so i have a feeling that i was dragged into it asiasister huh the person who is standing on the opposite side of me i probably wont meet her ever again that girl will walk her own path and i will walk my own path we just happen to be the servant of a devil and the servant of god we
just met by chance we probably shouldnt see each other again it might lead us to an unfortunate destiny just like that im thinking something cool aaaah yes yes im just a weak pawn theres nothing good about me so can i even get a peerage how about it maou sama well its probably useless discussing this with the maou sama anyways i laugh bitterly at myself im going to have a goal thats it first of all my goal will be to use the magiccircle to get transported this will be my first step yeah this is it yup im getting fired up sobbing time is over ive turned into a devil that cant be changed then i will have to live on as a devil and i will make my dream come true as a devil even if i cant working hard to achieve it will be my life goal yeah i can do it im going to do it part 2 its late it night and im on my bicycle heading towards a particular house not a mansion or an apartment but just an ordinary house its my first time so what shall i do since the
client isnt living alone wont the clients family see me after all i actually have to visit the house to make a contract i was told before that ordinary human cant detect me but does it apply to this situation as well im worried but i realise it when im about to push the bell the entrance door is open seriously leaving the door open in the middle of the night heartbeat i suddenly felt uneasy what is this i have a really bad feeling but im already walking into house i look inside from the entrance there are no lights in the hallway there is a staircase that led to the second floor but there are no lights on there is only one room at the end of the first floor with some lights on and its a faint light yeah theres something definitely wrong i feel no presence of any human are they sleeping impossible then i wont be feeling this uneasiness i take my shoes off at the entrance and carried them in my hand i walk into the room without making a sound im a devil not a thief im thinking of an excuse like that
i look into the room from the door that is slightly opened and the brightness is due to the candles hello im a devil from the gremorys household umm is the client here i ask quietly but there is no reply it cant be helped so i enter the room its a living room and there is a television a sofa a table and such it looks like an ordinary living room then i stop my breath my eyes are glued to the wall a wall there is a corpse nailed to the wall its upside down a human its a male is he the person who lives here but why the corpse has been cut viciously something that looks like a giblet is coming out from the wounds gough i vomit out the thing inside my stomach on the spot i didnt vomit when i saw that monster but my body reacted to seeing this corpse i cant endure looking at this corpse any more the corpse is attached to the wall with screws making the shape of a cross upside down there are big and thick screws screwed into the palm of each hand into the feet and
at the middle of its torso this isnt normal not normal at all you cant kill a person like this with a norma l mind there is a puddle of blood on the floor from the drips of blood falling from the corpse there is writing on the wall wwhat is this its written as punishment for those who did bad deeds i just borrowed the sentence from someone importa nt suddenly the voice of a young male comes from behind me when i turn around there is a man with white hair he seems to be a foreigner and he looks like hes still a teenager hes dressing up like a priest hes also a bishounen seeing me the priest makes an evil smile hmm hmm well well if it isnt a devil kun he seems to be really happy then the thing that buchou told me comes back to my mind dont get involved with people from the church especially the exorcists they are our biggest enemy they can easily eliminate us because their powers are supported by the prayer of god hes a priest so hes related to the church this is bad he even knows that
im a devil so am i in the worst situation there is again im a priest a boy priest i cut down devillike people and i laugh at them i cut the head of you devils and receive my meal the priest starts to sing ii dont get it what is wrong with this guy my name is freed sellzen i belong to a certain exorcism organisat ion ah just because i introduced myself doesnt mean you have to i dont want to remember your name in my memory so please dont its okay since you are going to die soon i will make sure of it it might hurt at first but later you will feel so good that you will cry now lets open the new door ze ive never met someone like him before his words dont make any sense so this guy is an exorcist im in trouble now but theres something i want to say to him i swallowed down my spit and ask him hey was it you the one who killed this person yes yes i killed him because he was a regular criminal who has been summoning devils so i had to
kill him wwhat kind of an excuse is that huh are you shocked arent you running away thats weird really weird i mean humans who make a pact with devils are scum scum indeed cant you understand that no is that so well you are a scum devil after all this guy is crazy you cant even have a normal conversation with him but i will say what i have to how can a human kill another human then arent you only supposed to kill devils haaaaa what the fuck is that a mere devil like you is lecturing me hahaha i will laugh at this you probably could get a reward for being funny okay then listen carefully you shitty devil devils also use humans greed to survive relying on a devil proves that you are no longer a human its the end thats why i killed him i make a living by killing devils and those that are contracted to a devil thats my job even devils wont go this far haa what are you talking about devils are trash do you know they are a shitty existence do you know this is common sense didnt you know
seriously you should start your life back from a toddler w ait its useless to tell this to a reincarnated devil like you more like i have to kill you hahahaha its awesome isnt it its the best isnt it the priest pulls out a sword that had no blade and a gun booom a sound vibrates in the air the sword that only has a handle turns into a thing like a beam saber what is that it looks like a beam saber from gundam you kind of irritate me so can i cut you can i shoot you is it ok okay then now im going to stab your heart with this blade of light and im going to blow your head with this cool looking gun man im seriously going to fall in love swift the priest came sprinting towards me he slashes his blade of light at me oh crap i just dodged it but intense pain runs through my leg there are smokes coming out of the priests gun was i shot but i dont hear any gunshots then suddenly i felt another shot of pain on my leg again guaaaah i fell on my
knees while moaning this time i was shot on my left calf it hurts but i know this pain how is it the special bullet made for the exorcists the bullet of light and it doesnt make any sound since its bullet of light this situation turns both of us on doesnt it the pain of light yeah this is the pain of light to a devil light is poisonous once hit the pain goes through your entire body die die devil die devil turn to dust and disappear this is all for my entertainment the priest is laughing madly and is about to finish me off please stop then there is a voice of a woman i am familiar with the priest froze his posture to where he was about to attack me and looks towards the direction where the voice came from i also look to the same direction a girl is there and i know her asia yes the blond sister is standing there well if it isnt my assistant asia chan what happened did you finish putting the barrier nnoooooooo asia screams after seeing the corpse that is nailed to the wall thank you for the
adorable scream oh yeah this is yo ur first time seeing a corpse like this isnt it asia chan then look carefully we have the humans that are entranced by a devil die like this n no she then looks at us and gets shocked to see me father freedthat person asia looks at me directly person no no this shit here is a devil hahaha what are you misunderstanding ise san is adevil she seems to be shocked to find out the truth and didnt know what to say what what you guys know each other wow now this is a big surprise is it the forbidden love between a devil and a sister seriously are you serious freed the priest looks at both asia and me i didnt want her to know it should have stayed like that its better that she didnt know i didnt plan on seeing her again i just wanted her to think of me as a kind high school student who lives in this town man i dont know what to say what a rotten destiny asias eyes are making me feel bad im sorry im sorry for being a devil ahaha devils
and humans can never coexist especially humans from the church and the devils are the biggest enemies also we are a group of heretics that was deserted by god asia tan and i are humans that cant survive without the support of fallen angels sama fallen angel what does he mean dont priests and nuns work under god well now leaving that aside i need to kill this trash here or else i cant finish my job so here i come are you ready the priest thrusts his sword toward me again if i get stabbed by that in my chest i will be killed even if i do survive i will end up like that the client who is nailed to the wall and then have my body slashed feeling of fear controls my body when i think about it this is bad this situation is really bad i will be killed without being able to move my body while i was thinking about it the blond sister walks between the priest and i she stood in front of me with her arms spread as if she is protecting me the priest puts on a stern look when he
sees this h ey hey are you serious asia tan do you know what you are doing i do father freed i beg you please forgive this person please let him go i became speechless after hearing her asia are you protecting me i cant stand it any more you can t kill people just because they are entranced to a devil and you also cant kill devils its wrong haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah dont talk shit bitch you also learned that devils are trash at the church seriously is there something wrong with your brain freed now has an anguished expression there are good people even among devils there arent idiooooooot tthats what i thought until recently but ise san is a good person that fact doesnt change even after i found out that he is a devil killing someone is unforgivable this kind of act god wont allow such acts she saw the corpse and she found out that im a devil so she should be shocked but asia isnt backing down to speak her beliefs to the priest what a strong willed girl this girl is amazing baki kyaa the bastard priest hit asia to the side with his gun
asia fell to the ground hey asia i went to asia who was struck away theres a bruise mark on her face that bastard actually hit her the fallen angel girl told me very strongly that i cant kill you but im getting a bit pissed since i cant kill you than can i rape you or something if i dont i wont be able to heal my heart but before that i need to kill that trash over there the priest points his blade of light at me again i cant run away while leaving asia here i cant leave her here with him who just talked about doing scary stuff if im running away then it will be with asia so i have to fight can i fight using my sacred gear even thoug h i dont know its effect im also the weakest piece pawn i have a slim chance of winning but i have to i cant leave a girl who just defended me so come i made a fighting posture in front of the priest the priest whistles and seems really hap py eh eh seriously seriously you are going to fight me you will
die you know you will die with a lot of pain i have no intention of killing you painlessly okay now then lets see if i can make a new record for the smallest minced meat hes t alking something creepy again but i cant act pathetically front of asia the priest jumps up high then the floor glows in a blue and white colour what is this the priest becomes suspicious when the floor glows the blue light starts to form a shape its a magic circle and i have seen this before the magiccircle of the gremory household i is it flash the magiccircle that appeared on the floor shines then the people i know appear from it i mean devils hyoudou kun we came to rescue you kiba smiles at me ara ara this is awful priest akenosan and konekochan yes my comrades kuu they came to rescue me im so moved that i feel like crying great something like this actually happens hyahou heres a present for a group of devils the priest starts slashing his sword kagin the sound of the metal echoes through the room kiba blocks the priests attack with his sword im
sorry hes one of us we cant let you lay a finger on him oh oh a mere devil being concerne d about their comrade what are you guys devil squadron the devil rangers thats nice i can feel the heat im getting turned on so how is it are you the one sticking it in and is he the one bending so are you guys in that sort of relationship they are exchanging swords but the priest is getting cocky and sticking his tongue out while he is shaking his tongue and his head that guy is completely looking down on us even kiba has an anguished expression yeah that guy is definitely disgusting what a vulgar mouth its hard to believe you are a priest oh thats why you are a stray exorcist right yeah yeah im vulgar sorry about that thats because i strayed away i was kicked out thats why screw the vatican im all right as long as i get to cut devils whenever i feel like it both of them are still exchanging their swords kiba has a calm expression but his eyes have already captured his foe the boy priest freed is still
laughing and enjoying the fight you are the type tha t is the most hard to deal with someone who feels like they are living by cutting devilsthe one who causes the most harm to us haaaaah you know i dont want to be told off by a devil im trying to live now just like other people im not in a pos ition where pests like you can talk down to me even devils have rules akenosan is smiling but her eyes are serious she is showing a sign of will to fight and hostility towards freed nice i like those passionate eyes onee san you are the best i can feel your urge of wanting to kill me is this love no i think its a killing intent superb this is great i love the feeling of intending to kill and getting intended to kill then disappear the person who appears on my side is the crimson haired girl riasbuchou ise im sorry i never expected that a stray exorcist will visit this clients house buchou who is apologising to me narrows her eyes after seeing my wounds ise did you get wounded ah sorry i was shot
i try to deceive her by laughing ah looks like she will yell at me afterwards sorry for being weak buchou but buchou didnt say anything to me and gives a cold expression to the priest looks like you have been looking after my cute servant her voice is low and sounds scary wow buchou is pissed am i the reason yes yes i have been playing around with it i was planning to cut his body all over but i was interrupted and it finished as a dream bon a section of the furniture behind the priest is blown away its buchou buchou shot out a ball of demonic power i make sure i never forgive those who harm my servants i especially cant forgive a lowlife like you damaging my personal possessions her intensity causes the atmosphere to feel frozen her killing intent lurks around the room there is a thing that looks like waves of demonicpower surrounding buchou buchou there seems to be few fallen angels heading to this house at this rate we will be at a disadvantage seems like akenosan detected something and informs us the fallen angels are approaching those guys with black wings
buchou gives another stare at the priest akeno we will return to our headquarters once we retrieve ise prepare for teleportation yes akenosan starts to cast a spell as soon as buchou urges her to teleport are we running away i then look at asia buchou we have to take her as well i say it to buchou its impossible only devils can use the magic circle to transport also this magic circle can only teleport me and my servants nno my eyes and asias eyes met she just smiles at me asia isesan lets meet again that was the last words we exchanged at this place next moment akenosan finishes casting the spell and the magiccircle on the floor starts to glow blue again like i will let you escape the priest came slashing at us but konekochan threw the sofa against him by the time the priest smacks away the sofa with his sword we were already teleported to the club room i dont hav e the time to think about the impression of my first teleportation through the magiccircle and i only remember the smile asia gave me last part 3 there are two types of exorcists
im listening to buchous explanation while having my legs heal the f irst are the exorcists who receive the blessing from god to perform exorcism in the name of justice this group of exorcist borrows its power from god and angels to eliminate devils and there is another one stray exorcists stray buchou nods at my question again with that stray exorcism is a holy ceremony that is performed in the name of god but sometimes there are exorcists who starts to enjoy the act of killing devils they are beings who have found killing devils as joy and as their purpose of life so they get kicked out from the church without exception or they get erased for being found guilty erasedso they get killed but there are those who survive what do you think happens to those exorcists its simple they go to the fal len angels fallen angels are the ones with black wings right yes even though fallen angels are beings that were kicked out from the heaven they still have the power of light the power to eliminate devils the fallen angels also lost a lot of th eir comrades and their men in the
previous war thats why they started to collect servants just like us i understood the situation as soon as she told me that much so the fallen angels who finds the devils a nuisance and the exorcists who wants to kill devils have the same objective right yes thats why they are called stray exorcists so the dangerous exorcists who became addicted to devilhunts started to attack devils and the humans with connections to devils by borrowing powers from the fallen angels the boy priest from earlier is exactly that hes a stray exorcist who belongs to an organisation with the support of the fallen angels they are not proper exorcists but they are still dangerous like the proper ones no since they have no restrictions on them they are much harder to deal with than the actual exorcists its not smart to deal with them so the church you went to before does not belong to god but to the fallen angels i knew they were a threat i realised how dangerous they are when i was fighting that shitty priest he is really evil he only thought about fighting and has joy in killing devils getting involved with
the group where more shits like that exist is dangerous i know that i really do but but so i have to say it to buchou buchou i need to save that girl asia its impossible how will you fight them you are a devil and she is a servant of fallen angels its the two kinds that can not coexist saving her means making the fallen angels your enemies if that happened we would also have to fight i couldnt say anything back to her i will cause trouble to buchou and others due to my selfishness i compared asia with buchou and others but i cant find the answer which one is more important thatthat will be i realised what a small man i am because i cant find the right answer i cant save even a single girl i am too weak part 4 haa noon ive skipped school today and im currently sitting on a bench in a childrens park while making a sigh the wounds i received from the priest on my leg yesterday havent completely healed according to buchou the fallen angel who gave its power to that priest must have a dense power
of light so it seems like they will be troublesome for us devils since light is poisonous to us with this leg i cant do the devils job for a while so i was told to take a break by buchou buchou probably has already talked to the teacher so it should be fine thats because buchou controls the school from the shadows guu my stomach rumbles now that i think about it i havent eaten since morning i have been thinking about asia and my career as a devil the whole time how can i save asia before that does asia even like her current situation that i don t know but i have made my own assumption that she wont enjoy working in the same place as a psycho priest who will hit her umm if i do things on my own it will cause a lot of trouble to buchou and the others i want to get stronger thats the only thing in my mind right now there are many things that are possible to do only if you are strong in my short life as a devil that is the only thing im sure of it
seems like i have to be stronger in order to achieve my dream since then ive learned how to make my sacred gear appear whenever i feel like but since i dont know how to use it its a waste but maybe relying on the sacred gear makes me a weakling all right once my wounds heal im going to start building muscles im also going to ask buchou and akenosan how to use demonicpowers im not happy but im might ask kiba to teach me how to use sword anyway i have my plans now im going to get stronger than that shitty priest no i need to be strong enough to run away from the fallen angel on my own im a pawn but i can do it as long as i work hard i want to believe that yeah since i have a new plan ill buy lunch somewhere and go home when i got up from the bench the colour gold appears to my eyes when i look carefully th ere is a blond haired girl that im familiar with she also notices me both of us are shocked at this meeting asia ise san part
5 auu its a strange sight a sister is getting confused in front of the register wwhat would you like to o rder even the employee doesnt know how to handle this situation its lunchtime and i took asia to a fast food restaurant at the business district it seems like asia never came to this kind of place before so she is having a hard time choosing her meal i offered my help but she said proudly its fine i will manage it somehow so i have been watching her the whole time thinking carefully you cant speak japanese seeing the chance i help her sorry she will have the same order as me okay the employee takes the order asia on the other hand is shocked auu im ashamed i cant even buy a single hamburger by myself wwell first you need to get used to japanese we head towards the empty table as soon as we got our meals while i encourage asia who is feeling down while we are moving inside the restaurant most of the male customers are looking at asia its because she is a nun but also because shes really cute well any
guy will look at her if they saw her we sat opposite each other but asia is taking a really good look at the hamburger and isnt eating it rather does she even know how to eat it wow what a strange development princess you can eat this by taking the wrap off like this i showed her how to do it while smiling ttheres actually a way to eat like that a amazing what a new reaction you are seriously cute asia you also eat the fries like this oh my asia is looking at me eating the fries with very keen eyes no no you also eat asia yyes she takes a small bite of the burger she starts eating it ddelicious this burger is very delicious this girl is saying it while her eyes are shining what does she normally eat you never ate a burger before no i have seen it often on television but its my first time eating it im moved its delicious oh so what do you normally eat mainly bread and soup i also eat vegetable and pasta food such simple food is church like that is that right then eat it
carefully so you remember the taste yes i will eat it with joy asia starts eating it deliciously but why was she at that park she said she has time off but it seems like she is running away from something when she saw me she seemed relieved i wanted to ask her but that might been a thoughtless question i probably should wait till she feels like telling me i will help her any time there is also the thing about buchou and the others but i cant tell her that its so irritating oh well since she is enjoying eating her hamburger i feel bad asking her something that will make her depressed yeah thats it just for today we shall forget about everything that was the answer i got asia yyes we will go and have some fun now eh lets go to the game centre the legendary fastest downhill driver ise booooom i put my foot down on the accelerator and quickly change the gear around the curve i then went past both cars fast you are so fast ise san fufufu are you watching me asia now fall in love with my driving handling technique
just like that i was playing a racing game at the game centre even though i look like this i didnt join any school club before joining the occult research club the three of us motohama matsuda and i went through all of the game centres nearby racing game or not i can beat any games win the sign that shows my victory appears on my screen yeah looks like i achieved a new highscore again like that i was falling for myself then i lost sight of asia when i looked she is standing in front of the crane game what is it hau n no i its nothing when i ask her she tries to hide it is there something you want when i look inside the crane game there is a doll of rache kun inside its a cute mascot based on a mouse if i remember correctly this character came from japan but its popular worldwide so thats why asia also knew it asia do you like rache kun eh n no t that is asias face gets red and she nods her head shyly okay i will get it for you eh b but its
okay i will get it strike while the iron is hot i put the coin in immediately and started controlling the crane even though i look like this im pretty good at crane games you know well thats what i though t but i had a hard time getting it on my first try i dropped the doll on a good location and on my second try i totally missed on my third and fourth try i missed it as well but when asia became worried on my fifth try i finally managed to get it yeah i made a victory pose and took rachekun which i just dropped out i then give it to asia here you go asia asia became so happy that she held the doll to her chest thank you very much ise san i will take care of this doll hey hey if a doll like that makes you happy then ill get you more next time thats what i said to her but she shook her head no this rache kun that you gave me represents the wonderful day i met you since today is the only day i met you i will take
good care o f this doll her words makes me shy but when this girl says it it actually seems natural well never mind okay we havent started yet asia we will play for the whole day today follow me yyes i took asias hand and went further into the g ame centre part 6 ah we played a lot today yyesim a bit tired we are walking on the street while laughing its already evening hahaha ive skipped school today and had fun till dusk we are lucky that we didnt get caught by the police if we did then i wouldve been taken into custody right away i ended up being tired both asia and i it was fun to see asias reaction when we went to the game centre and other shops rather i feel the dating plan that i had made for yuumachan has proven to be of good use you really cant tell what will happen in life since i never expected to become useful oh i almost tripped over because of the uncomfortable feeling on my leg ouch then i felt a bit of pain as well its the wound from yesterday the place
where i was shot by that shitty priest still hurts looks like the day when it gets healed will be quite far from now ise san are you injured is it from yesterday asias expression gets cloudy i think i messed up we were having a good time but i made her remember something painful but asia bends down and starts to check my injuries can you please lift your trouser up ssure i lift my trousers to have my calf exposed the bullet mark is still there asia then places her palm there a warm and gentle light shines on my calf it really is a warm light its a green light its like asias eyes and it looks so beautiful it feels like her kindness is inside her light how is it asia stops her light and she urges me to move i move my leg a bit oh wow this is amazing this is amazing asia i dont feel uncomfortable anymore i dont feel any pain at all i run around a bit asia smiles happily when she sees me you are amazing asia the healing power its an incredible power this is a sacred gear right
yes it is just like i thought to tell you the truth i also have a sacred gear though its not much of a use right now that is asia puts on a shocked face after hearing my confession isesan you also ha ve a sacred gear i didnt realise it at all hahaha i dont even know its effect and to compare it asia your power is amazing this can heal humans animals and also devils like me right she put on a complicated expression then a sad face soon after a single drop of tear falls from her eyes then more tears starts flowing out from her eyes she then got down and starts to cry i dont know what to do so i took her to a spot where we can sit we sit on the bench on the roadside then she tol d me a story about the girl who was once called the holy maiden in a certain region in europe there was a girl who was discarded by her parents she was raised in a church nearby by a nun along with other orphans the girl who was a strong follower of the church
received a special power at the age of 8 she healed a wounded puppy and a person from the catholic church witnessed it by chance from there on her life changed the girl was taken to the main catholic church and she was symbolized by many as a holy maiden because of her healing power she used her power to heal many believers and they were told it was a power of divine protection rumors brought rumors and she was respected as a holy maiden even without her approval she had no dissatisfaction for how she was treated people from the church were kind and she didnt hate healing people she instead was happy that her power was of use the girl was thankful to her power which was bestowed to her by god but she was a bit lonely she didnt have any friends she could open up to everyone treated her nicely and was nice to her but there were no one willing to become her friend she understood why she knew that they were looking at her power as something irregular they didnt look at her as a human but as a creature that could heal humans
but one day it changed by coincidence there was a devil nearby and she healed it a wounded devil the girl couldnt ignore it she thought that even if it was a devil she had to heal it if it was injured it was her kindness that made her take such an action but that changed her life forever one of the people from the church saw that incident and notified others of the church the ministers of the church were shocked about it a power that can heal devils something absurd like that can not happen the power of healing can only heal the followers of god yes there were several people who had the power to heal but the power to heal the devil was out of the question the people of the church thought it was common sense that the power of healing doesnt work on fallen angels and devils apparently a similar incident had happened in the past the power to heal fallen angels and devils that were not protected by god but that was feared as the power of a witch so the people saw her as a heretic damn witch that heals devils the
girl who was respected as a holy maiden was then feared as a witch and the catholic church abandoned her she didnt have anywhere to go and the organization of stray exorcists picked her up in other words she had to get divine protection from the fallen angels but the girl never forgot to pray to god she also never forgot to thank god even so the girl was abandoned god didnt save her what shocked her the most was that there was not even a single person in the church that was willing to defend her there was no one who cared about her its because i didnt pray enough its because im clumsy im so stupid that i cant even eat a burger by myself the girl asia wipes her tears while laughing i didnt know what to say to her i didnt know what to say after finding out her devastating past just like she showed before she is a sacred gear possessor that has the power to heal even devils this is also a trial that the lord gave me since im a clumsy nun the lord gave me this trial so i have to endure
it she was laughing as if she was talking to herself you dont have to say anything any more im sure i will make lots of friends one day i have a dream i want to go buy flowers with a friend buying books andtalk she is full of tears i cant look at her any more she must have been enduring it the whole time she has been waiting for god to save her the whole time and has been hiding her feelings all along hey hey god whats the meaning of this why dont you save this girl she has been longing for your help she has been respecting you more than anyone what are you doing why arent you doing anything i dont know a single thing about you and i also dont believe in any religion on top of that im a devil but even a devil like me can talk to her werent you the one that gave us the sacred gears this this is wrong ah i know this is what im going to do watch me god i took her hand i say it to her while looking directly to her eyes which
is wet with her tears asia i will become your friend no we are already friends asia stands there looking puzzled im a d devil but its all right i wont take asias life and i wont take any price you can call me whenever you feel like it ah and i will also give you my mobile number i put my hand inside my pocket to get my mobile phone out why its not why asia you played with me for the whole day right we talke d right we laughed together right then you and i are friends a human a devil or god doesnt matter we are friends is that a pact with a devil its not asia and i are going to become actual friends we will put other things aside we will talk when we want to we will play when we want to and yeah i will also go shopping with you whether its books or flowers we will go shopping much as you want okay even i think that i suck at conversation its not even romantic kiba probably knows the right thing to say at a time like this but asia put
her hand on her mouth and once again starts to shed tears though this time her tears didnt seem sad ise san i have no common sense we could learn by going around the city if you go around looking at different things you would learn eventually i cant speak japanese i also dont know about its culture i will teach you i will even make you speak using a proverb leave it to me we could even go to museum to look at japanese national treasure samurai sushi and geisha i also dont know what to talk about with a friend i hold asias hand tightly you talked to me normally for a whole day that was fine we were already talking like friends will you become my friend yeah so lets get along from now on asia she nods her head and smiles yeah with this its ok asia and i are friends but this situation sure makes me blush i will probably tremble with embarrassment once i go to bed after this but it doesnt matter if asia will smile then its okay the incident from her sad past i wont know how painful it was but
im positive that i can keep her smiling from now on even a human and a devil can be friends i thought it was impossible at first but i dont care any more i am definitely going to see her from now on as her friend i wont let anyone get in our way i will protect asia its impossible a voice which rejects all my thoughts when i look towards the direction of where the voice came from i become speechless thats because the person i am familiar with is standing there a slender girl with silky black hair amano yuumachan is standing there yyuuma chan she laughs of amusement when she hears my trembling voice heh you survived and as a devil seriously that is the worst her voice isnt the cute voice of yuuma chan and she sounds more like that of a bewitching adult raynare sama asia calls her by that name raynare yeah thats right i totally forgot amano yuuma is a fallen angel thats right i almost forgot about that i see so its the fallen angel raynare so thats her real name what does a fallen angel like you want she sneers when
i said that to her i dont want a filthy low class devil like you talking to m e she stares at me as if she is looking at something very disgusting that girl asia is our personal belonging can i have her back asia you know its useless to run away run what does she mean no i dont want to return to that church i dont want to return to the people who kill other people also you people did things to me asia replies back with disgust what happened what happened inside that church please dont say that asia your sacred gear is essential for our plan so plea se come back with me i also took the time to look for you stop being such a troublesome bitch raynare approaches us asia hides behind me her body is shaking with fear i take a step forward to protect her wait cant you see she doesnt want to y u no raynaresan what are you going to do with her after taking her back low class devil dont call me by my name my name will get filthy whats between us doesnt have anything to do with
you if you dont go back to your masters place quickly you will die you know raynare gathers light in her hand is it the spear i was killed once because of it i need to make the first move ssacred gear when i shouted towards the sky loudly lights cover my left arm and forms into a red gauntlet yeah its a success looks like secretly practicing on how to make my sacred gear appear without making the posture paid off seeing my sacred gear raynare shows a shocked expression for a moment and then starts to laugh i was told that your sacred gear w as a dangerous one before from the higherups but it looks like they were totally wrong the fallen angel starts to laugh as if she found it amusing what whats so funny your sacred gear is one of the common ones its called the twice critical it doubles the power of the possessor for a temporally time but having you double your power is not a threat to me truly a fitting object for a low class devil like you the ability that doubles the possessors power is that the power of my
sacred gear and she said its one of the common but thats good enough for now i need to shake raynare off somehow and run away with asia but where to the school i cant i cant cause trouble for buchou and others my house how shall i explain it to my parents damn it even though im her friend i dont know where to take asia damn i will think about it later first of all i need to beat this fallen angel in front of me shit its the worst case that i have to fight my ex girlfriend why do i always get into this mess sacred gear activate you can double my power right then activate then the jewel on the gauntlet starts to glow boost a sound is made next moment i felt power flowing into me is this what it means to double my powers yeah with this stab a nasty sound something stabs my stomach the spear of light she threw at me again even if your power is doubled you cant even evade this small spear i made even if the power of 1 is doubled its only 2 you cant narrow
the po wer gap between us do you understand now lowclass devil kun i fall down this is bad light is poisonous its poisonous for a devil and i was hit in my stomach this is i prepare myself for the intense pain which will be followed by certain death but i dont feel any pain at all thats because a green light is enveloping around my body when i look asia is healing my wound she is putting her hand on my stomach and is healing my wound for me the spear of light gradually gets smaller and it eventually disappears i dont feel even the slightest pain instead i can feel asias warmth asia if you dont want that devil to be killed come with me your sacred gear is essential for our plan your power the twilight healing is a rare sacred gea r unlike the sacred gear of the devil over there if you dont come with me i will have to kill that devil raynare gives a cruel order im the hostage like hell i am sshut up i can defeat you yes i understand without hearing me asia accept s the fallen angels order
asia isesan thank you for today it was really fun she makes a big smile my stomach has completely healed after she confirms it she walks towards raynare good girl asia thats it problem solved with todays ritu al you will be freed from your suffering raynare put on a lecherous smile shit she doesnt look anything like the yuuma chan that i know also what does she mean by ritual it only sounds like something bad i then shout towards asia asia wait were friends arent we yes thank you for being friends with someone like me i promised to protect asia ii have to protect asia she turns around but she is still smiling at me i become fascinated with her smile for a moment goodbye she says her farewell raynare covers asia with her black wings low class devil looks like you were saved because of this girl if you get in my way again i will definitely kill you goodbye ise kun the fallen angel who sneers at me flew up high while holding asia they disappear into the sky the only thing left is me black feathers and rachekun that asia has left behind i
couldnt do anything i will protect asia what a joke i fell on to my knees and punched the ground i bite my teeth hard and i cry out with frustration damn it damn it daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamit asia i cry out the name of my friend towards the sky theres no reply asiaaaaaaaaaaa for the first time in my life i cursed myself for being weak life4 im saving my friend part 1 slap a sound echoes in the club room the sound came from my cheek i was slapped buchou slapped me on my cheek she has a serious expression how many times do i have to repeat myself no is no i cant allow you to save that sister i visited the school after i couldnt save asia and reported the story to buchou even after i reported what happened i proposed to go to that church obviously to save asia but buchou on the other hand said that she wouldnt get involved in this matter i wasnt able to agree with her decision so i tried to convince her even though i knew it was rude thats why she slapped me the first slap i ever received in
my life hurts more than i thought especially my heart hurts i have been continuing to betray buchou who holds high expectations for me but still there are things that i cant give up on then i will go by myself im worried about the ritual thing the fallen angels are doing something from behind the scenes theres no guarantee of asias safety are you really that stupid you will definitely be killed if you go you wont be able to come back to life anymore do you understand buchou tries to talk calmly but she is talking to me as if she is warning me your actions will affect not only me but also the other members you are a devil of the gremory group you need to be aware of that then let me out of this group ill go there as an individual i cant do that why dont you understand i think its the first time ive seen buchou t his enraged i have been causing a lot of trouble for buchou but there are things that i cant back down from i became friends with asia argento asia is my important friend i wont abandon
my friend thats a wonderful thing i think its amazing if you can say that face to face but that is different than what we are talking about now the relationship between a devil and a fallen angel is not as simple as you think the two sides have been glaring at each other for hundreds and thousands of years if you show them a single gap of weakness they will come and kill us they are our enemy wasnt blowing away the enemy the gremorys way of doing things we glare at each other i didnt back off i look straight into her eyes that girl was originally from gods side she is a person that we can not ever coexist with even if she went with the fallen angels it doesnt change the fact that she is still the enemy of us devils asia isnt our enemy i denied it strongly a kind girl like her cant be our enemy even if she isnt she has nothing to do with us ise you have to forget about her even if she says it like that theres no way i can forget about her then akeno san comes and
whispers into buchous ear what is it did something happen akenosan also has a serious expression but it looks like it isnt because of buchou and my discussion buchou who is listening to akenosan makes a serious face just as i thought something definitely happened buchou looks at me and then looks at the remaining members ive got an urgent thing to do now akeno and i will go out for a bit nno bbuchou i havent finished talking buchou put her index finger on my lips ise there are a couple of things i need to tell you first one you think that a pawn is a weak piece right am i right i nod quietly to her question thats a big misunderstanding pawn has a special ability that no other pieces have that ability is the promotion promotion what is that just like the actual chess game pawn can change into other classes if they reach the opponents base they are able to promote to any other piece besides the king piece ise when you step foot in the location i acknowledge as enemys base you are able to change into any piece besides the king oh man
so i can promote to kibas knight class koneko chans rook class and also even akeno sans queen class since it hasnt been that long since you became a devil there are restrictions so its probably still impossible for you to be promoted to the ultimate piece a queen but you could change to other classes if you wish strongly for promotion within your heart then there will be a change in your ability amazing just listening to it gave me a lot of information if i add the promotion with my sacred gear then i might be able to beat that priest also one more thing its about the sacred gear when you use your sacred gear just remember this buchou starts to stroke my cheek with her hand desire sacred gear is driven with the power of desire and it also determines the power for it as well even though you are a devil your will to desire hasnt been lost the stronger you desire the stronger your sacred gear will respond to you desire the power of desire will activate the sacred gear so if i strongly wish for it this will activate theres one last thing
you should never forget ise even a pawn can take down the king this is basic in chess this truth also applies for the devils chess pieces you can become stronger after saying that she teleports to some other place through the magiccircle along with akenosan the only ones left are me kiba and konekochan after i take a deep breath i was already determined to go and was about to leave hyoudou kun kiba calls me are you going yeah i am i have to go asia is my friend after all im the one who has to save her you will get killed even if you have the sacred gear and even if you use promotion you cant take down a group of exorcists and fallen angels by yourself logical answer i already know that im very aware of that even so im going even if i die i will set asia free good determination thats what i would like to say but its still reckless then what am i supposed to do i shouted at him but he says it straight at me im going too wha i lost my words after hearing something unexpected of course
i just heard something that i wasnt expecting i dont know much about asiasan but you are my comrade even though buchou said that theres a part of me that respects your decision also i personally dont like fallen angels and priests i detest them this guy probably has some kind of past as well but to hear the wo rd comrade from him remember what buchou said when you step foot in the location i acknowledge as enemys base you are able to change into any piece besides the king so isnt she indirectly telling us that i acknowledge that the church is th e location where the enemy of rias gremory is ah i finally realise it i see so thats what she meant thats why she told me the information about promotion buchou indirectly approved you to go of course i think she also means that i should support you as well buchou may have some kind of plan if not she would have stopped you by locking you up somewhere kiba laughs buchou thank you very much i have witnessed how gracious buchou is once again and thanked her from the bottom of my heart if
i come back safely i will work harder im thanking buchou who isnt here silently and a small build girl approaches me im going as well wha koneko chan i feel uneasy for only having you two go koneko chaaaaaaaan i cant tell whats going in her mind since she doesnt show any expression but i feel like i just witnessed her kindness hidden in her im touched right now im so deeply touched koneko chan i became emotional with this girls word hhuh but im going as well kiba puts on a sad smile i know kiba thank you i thought that a troubled handsome is a bit cute all right with this its possible we can do it then lets go for a rescue mission with the three of us wait for us asia like this the three of us headed towards the church part 2 the sky is already dark and its already time for the street lamps to be on the three of us kiba konekochan and i are examining the church from a place where we can see it there is no one entering or exiting the church but the closer we got to the
church the stronger i started to have a bad feeling im sweating from all over my body when i ask kiba he says that from this presence its certain that there is a fallen angel inside so the enemys boss is inside here look at this map kiba spread out the map of the building on the road the map of the church where did he get if from well its basic when you are going into the enemys territory the good looking guy makes a smile wow what swift support i didnt even think about it and was trying to get in head on i realised how naive i am once again besides the sanctuary there is also a dormitory the sanctuary looks suspicious kiba points at the sanctuary so we can ignore the dormitory then most likely most stray exorcist groups usually make some alteration to the sanctuary they usually perform suspicious rituals under the sanctuary why i told him my doubt kiba makes a bitter smile its the place they used to respect as a holy place and by doing something that rejects god there it makes them satisfied because its an insult to god because they
loved god because they were rejected by god they purposely cast evil spells under the sanctuary as a representation for their hatred they are insane no even the god who cast away his faithful believers is at fault right now i hate god because of the incident with asia thats why i think that way the sanctuary is located right behind the entrance i think we can go straigh t in the problem is to find the door to the basement once we get in the sanctuary and also if we can defeat the assassins waiting for us assassins when i heard that word i start to have a bad premonition we look at each other in front of the church while the moonlight lit our face and then we nod to each other we are set now we only have to enter wait for me asia we passed through the entrance and went straight for the sanctuary the fallen angels will have noticed our intrusion by this point so the enemy knows that we have entered their territory theres no going back the only thing left is to head straight in we open the door and stepped inside the
sanctuary there is an altar and long chairs it looks like an ordinary sanctuary the candle lights and the interior lamps lit the sanctuary oh there is something that didnt seem normal the statue of the person on the cross it has its head destroyed what a creepy site clap clap clap clap then a clap echoes through the sanctuary someone who looks like a priest shows up from behind the pillar seeing his face i become disgusted meeting its a reunion so emotional its that white haired shitty priest i think his name is freed its him so hes the so called assassin huh he sure has a weird smile like always well i never met the same devil twice before you know since im super strong i cut devils into pieces when i first meet them once i see them i cut them up on the spot i then kiss the corpse and say goodbye thats ho w i used to live but since you guys ruined my style im so lost thats no good its not good to interfere with my lifestyle thats why you guys piss me off i hope you guys will die actually die
you trashy deeeeeeeeeeeevils after showing his joy and sadness he is in a rage now he takes out the gun and handleonly sword from before booom the blade of light appears it will be a troublesome to get cut by that sword that gun is also troublesome but its different from before its 3 against 1 now you guys came to rescue asia tan right hahaha devilsamas are big hearted for coming to rescue a bitch like that who would even heal devils well just being entranced to a devil should make that sister die die what does he mean hey where is asia well there is a hidden stairs under that altar from there you can go to the place where they are doing the ritual that guy spilled out the location of the hidden basement by pointing at the altar does he even know that he has to stop us or did he spill it out because hes confident that he can kill us and it will solve the problem sacred gear synchronized with my shout a red gauntlet appears on my left arm equipping the sacred gear completed okay kiba draw his sword from the sheath and
konekochan huh im so shocked that my eyes are about to pop out gogogo konekochan is lifting up the pews that are several times bigger than her get smashed konekochan throws the pews at the priest super girl that is totally an unexpected method of attack wow oh yeah the priest did a small dance and cut the chair in half with his blade of light the chair that is cut in half hits the ground there swift when i thought kiba went ahead he has already disappeared hes so fast that i cant see him giin there are sparks between kibas sword and the priests blade of light so its solid despite being made from light huh after all even if kiba slashes straight at him i can hear the sound of two metals colliding against each other hmmm hmmm such a pain why are you guys so noisy im super very bad im sorry for talking in a death language forgive me after you die kiba dodges the soundless bullets with his legs which he is proud of while continuing to attack his enemy kiba who is dodging all of the priests attacks is amazing but the priest
is also something because he can fight on par with a devil man he stopped kibas slash again i cant catch kibas movements with my eyes bu t the priest can so that shitty priest is not an opponent that i can take on by myself kiba and the priest then start to battle head on both of them are glaring at each other impressive you are quite strong ahaha you too a knight huh not ev en a single blind spot this is great yes yes this is what im talking about lately i havent had an awesome battle like this i was about to cry because of it hmmm hmmm im going to kill you then maybe i should also fight seriously for a bit then kiba is going to fight seriously what is he going to do eat this low pitched voice i cant believe its kibas voice because it has some intensity in it then some black stuff comes out of kibas sword it starts to cover the whole sword darkness if i have to describe it that will be it the darkness covers the sword no its more like the darkness is shaping into kibas
sword the darkness sword that is clashing against the priests blade of light starts to expand and is devouring the blade of light wha what the hell is this the priest seems confused holy eraser a darkness sword that devours light yyou are also a sacred gear possessor sacred gear kiba too i mean darknesssword looks awesome dammit so good looking ones get a good looking weapon as well the priests blade of light is completely devoured by kibas sword and it cant maintain its shape after having the lights devoured now this is my chance i went straight at him sacred gear activate boost a sound comes out from the jewel and the power flows into my body my target is the shitty priest the priest becomes aware of me im keeping on telling you you are annoying he points his gun that is loaded with bullets of light at me the bullet is shot without making any sound here promotion rook bashiin the bullet of light didnt pierce through me and instead returns to nothing promotion a pawn the priest seems to be in shock yeah im a pawn the pawn who is going to bash yo u
the traits of a rookunreal defence and my left fist hit the priests face thats what i thought but i felt something hard on my fist even so i punched as hard as i can the priest gets pushed far back ridiculous attack strength i laugh while breathing hard thats for hitting asia that time i feel relieved that i hit you once the priest is on the ground but gets up slowly and spits his blood onto the ground his right cheek is swollen just that i promoted to rook but looks like i still dont have koneko chans attacking power no if i look carefully his handle only sword is smashed up did he use that as a shield just before getting punched by me so thats the hard thing i felt he has a fast reaction hmm oh man not only i got punched by a trashy devil but hes saying some weird crap to medont fuck with me the priest makes a howl dont fuck with me you shiiiiiit a mere devil shouldnt act cocky with meeeeee ill kill you definitely ill definitely kill you im going to cut you into pieces you shiiiiit the priest
takes out his second sword which only has its handle he still has it how many does he have but the three of us me kiba and konekochan surround the priest the priest notices it and he looks around he begins to smirk wow wow is this what you call a crisis hmm for me getting killed by a devil is a nono so i feel like retreating its a shame that i cant exorcise you guys but i also dont want to die the priest takes out something round and smashes it on to the floor instantly our eyes are blinded with a shining light shit a smoke screen when my eyes healed i looked around but the priest is gone then the priests voice comes from somewhere hey the grunt devil over thereise kun was it to tell you the truth i have fallen in love with you so i will definitely kill you definitely okay i wont forgive a shitty devil who punched me and gave me a lecture okay then bye bye when my eyes are healed completely i looked around again but the priest has vanished without leaving a trace he escaped he even left
some parting words i was thinking about it and realised that i had no time to waste on him kiba konekochan and i nod at each other and went towards t he altars hidden stairs part 3 the three of us walk down the staircase under the altar it looks like the electricity works even in here with kiba in front of us we walk ahead after the stairs there is a single passage sometimes there are doors in both side of the wall so this is a basement huh koneko chan points to the far end by saying possibly at the end of this passage i can smell that person so asia is there then my spirit pumped up wait for me asia ill be there soon when we went further in a big door appears is that it possibly im sure there are groups of exorcists and fallen angels inside are you ready konekochan and i nod at kiba okay then well open the door when kiba and i were about to open the door the door opens by itself while making a large noise the inside of the ritual place becomes visible welcome devils the fallen angel
raynare spoke from the end of the room the room is full of priests they all have a sword handle that makes the blade of light in their hands i looked at the girl who is attached to the cross and shout asiaaa asia noticed my voice and looks at me ise san yeah ive come to save you i smile at her and a tear drops from her eye its a touching reunion but its too late the ritual is about to finish now the ritual is finished what does she mean suddenly asias body starts to glow aaah iyaaaaaaaaaaaa asia screams she looks very painfully asia i tried to reach her but the priests surround me i wont let you interfere damn devils i will destroy you move shitty priests i dont have time to bother with you all ban a big sound when i looked konekochan punched one of the priests away please dont touch me kiba also draw his darknesssword looks like i will have to go full throttle from the beginning i hate priests if there are this many then i wont hold back to devour your light kibas eyes become sharp and i can
feel chills from him the darkness is showing a very dense killing intent this will be an allout war iyaaaaaa at the same time a large light comes out of asias body raynare takes it to her hand this is it this is the power that i craved for a long time sacred gear with this i will be loved with an expression of ecstasy raynare hugs on to the light then the bright light envelops the ritual room when the light stops there is a fallen angel emitting green coloured light from her body ufufu ahahahahahaha i finally have it the supreme power wi th this i can become a supreme fallen angel with this i can payback all those who were looking down on me the fallen angel makes a big laugh i didnt pay attention to her and went straight to asia the priests are trying to stop me but kiba and konekochan support me by blowing them away kibas sword devours the light of the priests sword and koneko chan hit the priests who has lost their weapon with one mighty hit the combination of these two is remarkable and its obvious that it isnt the
type of combination possible with a few days of practice thanks you two asia who is attached to the cross she looks lifeless no she should still be okay i untied the things on her hands and legs and hold her in my arms i isesan asia i came to take you back yes her voice is very small when she replied and it didnt sound lively hey hey she should still be fine right she wont its futile raynare makes a smirk as if she is rejecting my thoughts once again possessors whos e sacred gear is taken away from their body will die that girl is going to die then give the sacred gear back i shout at her but she just laughs theres no way that i will give it back you know i even deceived my superiors to get my hands on th is i will kill all of you and erase all evidence shit you are nowhere close to the yuuma chan that i remember hearing that she starts to laugh out loudly fufufu it was pretty fun the time i dated you you were my first girlfriend yes watching it was very cute its

a disadvantage while we are protecting that girl so go upstairs at once well make the path for you now hurry kiba says it while taking down the priests hes right there are still a great number of priests left so ther e will be a limit to fighting this fallen angel here while protecting asia i glared at raynare and then left the place carrying asia koneko chan we will make an escape path for hyoudou kun affirmative the two of them starts to take down the priests who are trying to get in my way thanks to their support im able to get to the entrance of the ritual room right away kiba koneko chan you go ahead we will handle here please go quickly but just go damn kiba konekochan both of you are showing off too much but now i will have to rely on them my senior devils theres no way they will die in a place like this kiba koneko chan when i get back call me ise definitely we are comrades thats what i said to them it feels like the two of them smiled i left the place and went straight to
the passage at once part 4 i went up the stairs holding asia and came out to the sanctuary theres something wrong with asia her face is pale i laid her down on one of the pews just wait a bit you will be free soon asia you will be able to play with me from now on asia makes a small smile at my words she then takes my hand i cant feel any strength or warmth from her hand i was happy thati had a friendeven for a short while asia is smiling even though she is in pain if i were to be born again will you become my friend once more wwhat are you saying dont say that lets go somewhere to have fun i will drag you even though you dont want to we will go to karaoke game centre lets also go bowling also other places also to that place and there i cant stop my tears from coming out im supposed to be talking to her with a smile but i cant stop crying i know it i already know it this girl is dying she is going to die even so i
want to deny it that this has to be a joke we are friends always yeah thats right i will introduce you to motohama and matsuda they are a bit perverted but both of them are good guys they will definitely become your friends definitely we will have fun together well have fun until we can if i was born in this countryand went to the same school as you lets go come to our school asias hand pats my cheek you even cry for someone like menow i can her hand that is patting my cheeks drops slowly thank you those were her last words she passed away smiling i lost my strength i just stood there looking at her face my tears wont stop why why did this girl have to die she was a good girl she was a kind girl who would heal anyone injured how come no one became her friend how come i was never by her side hey god you are there right god devils and angels exist so you do exist as well right god you were watching right you were watching all of this right i shouted at the ceiling of
the church i dont know who will answer me but i just wanted to scream towards the ceiling please dont take this girl away please i beg you she hasnt done anything she just wanted a friend i will be her friend forever so please i want this girl to smile forever hey please god even though i screamed towards heaven no one answers me did this happen because i turned into a devil did you abandon her because im a devil a nd her friend i bite my teeth with regret i have no power i didnt have any power at all if i have more power as a devil if i have the power to at least save asia even if i regret it now she will never smile again ara a devil is repenting in a place like this or were you wishing for something the voice i heard from behind me is that of raynare when i turned around there is a fallen angel smirking at me look at this this is the wound i got from the knight boy while i was coming here raynare places her hand on her wound the shallow green light
starts to heal her wound look wonderful isnt it i can heal any kind of wound to us fallen angels who lost the protection of god that childs sacred gear was a wonderful present hey that light belongs to asia why are you using it are kiba and konekochan safe i start to wonder my status will rise since i will be a fallen angel that can heal fallen angels i could be of help to the great azazelsama and shemhazasama there is nothing more wonderful than this aaah azazel sama my power is all for you like i care i glared at raynare i dont care about that fallen angels god and devils those things had nothing to do with this girl no it did she was a chosen human that possessed a sacred gear even so she could have lived quietly she could have lived normally she couldnt those with irregular sacred gear would be left out of the world and groups because they possess a powerful ability because they have a different power than others you know humans hate those things right even though its a wonderful power like this then i would have protected asia as
her friend ahahahaha its impossible because she died that girl is dead you know its no t the matter of whether you protect her or not you couldnt protect her you couldnt protect her back at evening and even now you really are a weird boy its so amusing i know thats why i cant forgive you and myself i cant forgive everyt hing myself who couldnt protect asia raynare who killed asia then buchous words come into my mind desire sacred gear is driven with the power of desire and it also determines the power for it as well give her back even though you are a devi l your will to desire hasnt been lost the stronger you desire the stronger your sacred gear will respond to you give asia baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack dragon booster the sacred gear on my left arm activates as if it responded to my shout the jewel in the gauntlet makes a bright shine some mysterious mark appears on the gauntlet at the same time power flows into my body from my left arm equipped with the sacred gear to my whole body i went ahead while having my body overflow with power i thrust
my fist towards the fallen angel front of me who is smirking raynare dodges it easily as if shes dancing i will explain it so even a dummy like you can understand its a simple power difference i have a power of 1000 you have a power of 1 you cant shorten the gap between us no matter what even with the ability of that sacred gear the power doubled is only 2 its futile how can you win against me ahahahahahahaha boost another sound from the jewel the mark on the jewel of the gauntlet changes from i to ii heartbeat a second change happens to my body the power something to beat down the enemy in front of me is increasing uoooooooooo i went charging at her while concentrating my overflowing power to my fist im already promoted to a rook heh did your power increase a bit still its not enough my attack is dodged again next moment lights gather to raynares hand and it forms into something i put a lot of power in it eat this zudon the spear of light pierces both my legs it went deep into both of my thighs even with
the defence of a rook it wasnt able to defend against it guaaaaaaaaaah i screamed my body goes through intense pain but i cant get on my knees for something like this i grab onto the spear immediately burns guaaaaaaaaaah the sound of my flesh burning hot its burning hoooooooot is it because its made up of light the palm of my hand that is holding onto the spear gets burned there are smokes coming from my hand also from the wound s on my thighs its burning my hand and legs violently raynare starts to laugh at me after she sees me trying to pull out the spear ahahahaha a devil trying to pull that spear out is foolish to devils lights are intense poison just touching it will make you burn that is the ultimate pain that devils can taste for a low class devil like you its nugaaaaaaaah i made a scream which you cant describe in words but i tried to pull out the spear of light slowly by gripping strongly onto it the intense pain caused by the spear that is piercing my legs the intense pain that is inflicted on me by the power
of light those things are causing me so much pain im about to lose consciousness because of it it feels like i will die if i dont bite my teeth hard so what about it what about it this that girl this is nothing compared to what asia went through i pull out the spear slowly while my tears and drool comes out of my face it hurts it huuuuuurts dammit but this what about this zuryuuzuryuu the spear is being drawn out from my legs while making horrible noise when i got the spear out from both my legs i dropped it from my hand and it disappears before hitting the ground splash after losing the thing that was blocking the holes on my legs blood starts to flow out from the wounds even though i took out the spear the pain still remains boost even if i was pierced by the spear and stopped my attack the gauntlet on my left arm continues to make a sound it hurts it really hurts im crying a lot and i have so much drool coming out from my mouth slip i slipped onto my butt after i lost some strength
in me i dont have the strength to stand up shit i dont have any strength in my legs no i dont have any strength left in my whole body am i in a bad condition quite remarkable a low class devil pulling out the spear of light made by a fallen angel but its futile my light isnt flashy but has a high killing ability against devils the density of the light is strong so strong that it is used as the blade of light priests uses getting hurt even once will be hard to heal even for a middleclass devil for a low class devil like you this is the limit fufufu you cant look down on the damage caused by the power of l ight you know especially my light like always she is talking long about something i dont understand the light circulates around your body and cause damages to your whole body if you are late at healing it you will die no normally it wont be w eird to die with that damage you really have a strong build dont you ah is that right so for a trash like me who just became
a devil this wound is lethal huh just like i thought i can feel pain even from inside my body its not the pain of getting hit but something worse it feels as if my muscles and bones are melting because of the heat the pain is transmitted directly by my nerves so letting my guard down even once will feel like its going to screw my head i will probably die if i dont g et healed soon but i cant just sit here but i dont have any strength in my legs damn is this the end for me then i look at asia a girl who is sleeping quietly im sorry for being noisy yeah im all right im seriously fine im quite strongly built so its not a problem see look im going to ease some of the regrets you have left asia at times like this are we supposed to pray to god suddenly that slipped out of my mouth without realising it raynare seems puzzled but i continue to talk but god is no good he didnt listen to me before and he didnt even help a good girl like asia at all hahaha
such a useless god i wonder what you are trying to say did you finally break then him maou sama will you listen to my wish you exist right are you listening im also a devil so will you listen to my wish hes totally lost it this boy is talking to himself in a place like this im going to bash this shitty fallen angel in front of me so please make sure no on interferes i seriously dont want anyone to interfere i also dont need any back up i will do it myself and my legs are fine as well i will get up on my own so make it a one on one fight its a good situation my anger is so high that i think i can han dle this pain just one hit is enough please let me hit her my legs can move i have already lost the sensation in my legs just moving it by a millimetre gives me intense pain but it can still move my butt leaves the floor my body hasnt stopped shaking even so my body gets up slowly it hurts my whole body hurts but i can
move i can still move i just have to endure it until i hit her once i impossible your body isnt in a condition to move because of the damage of light i approach raynare slowly who has a shocked look on her face and i stood up right in front of her eyes with my feet shaking and lots of blood flowing out of me hey ex girlfriend ive been through a lot because of you theres no way you can stand a low class devil shouldnt be able to stand up with those wounds the lights are burning your insides from within your body a low class devil who doesnt have the demonic power to ease the effect of light shouldnt be able endure it yeah it hurts it really hurts im even close to losing my consciousness but you know my hatred towards you is so great that i can endure this i glared straight at my opponent without even blinking my next hit will be my last blow if i use it i will fall down thats why i have to finish it with my next hit i cant look away from my target hey my
sacred gear you still have the power to punch this thing in front of me right then lets finish it explosion the sound from the jewel made just now sounded especially strong the jewel shines even brighter such a bright light its dazzling but unlike the light of a fallen angel this light didnt give damage to me but instead it gives me peace just getting touched by this light feels like i am over flowing with pow er its similar to the light of heal that belongs to asia so there is a light that doesnt cause harm to devils i take a step forward the blood splashes onto the ground from my wounds i also coughed some blood looks like im in a critical condition there is no stopping to the pain im feeling right now it even reaches up to my brain but its okay i can still move even now my gauntlet is flowing power into me when i was against raynare at evening i was scared of the power difference between us my instinct as a devil instinct grasped hold of the overwhelming power difference between us and my body didnt stop shaking because of
it that time i thought that i could never beat her but its different now the power im receiving from this gauntl et is insane i somehow know its possibly because im the sacred gear possessor this power wont last forever this power is one time only if i use it against my enemy even once then it will end there even though the sacred gear isnt telling me verbally its telling me physically i made a posture to punch i have no experience in fighting but it will be okay if i hit her once my target is the shitty fallen angel that is in front of me im definitely going to hit her im absolutely not going to miss it impossible what is this why is something like this happening isnt that sacred gear supposed to be the twice critical which doubles the power of the possessor it cant be its not possible why has your power surpassed mine this w ave of demonic power im feeling is that of a middle classno that of a high class devil my power is that of a highclass devil is it because of my sacred gear hey hey werent you
supposed to be a sacred gear that just doubles my power buchou is the only high class devil i met so it means that im currently about the same strength as her lies this is all lies i am the fallen angel that has attained the ultimate healing power i turned into a superior being by obtaining this twilight healing i received the right to be loved by azazelsama and shemhaza sama i wouldnt lose to some lowlife like you raynare once again has a spear of light in both her hands buun i hit it to the side with my fist the spears of light disappear easily seeing me hit away her spears with ease raynares face gets even paler nno raynare is flapping her black wings and is about to fly away is she trying to run away hey hey you were looking down and laughing at me till a few seconds ago you run awa y as soon as you find out that you cant win who do you think you are but i wont let you escape like hell i would tap i went up to her at the same time shes about to fly and
i grabbed her arm i have unbelievable speed a speed that even the fallen angel cant react to the arm im holding onto feels unreliable and its so small that she looks weak i pulled her arm towards me i definitely wont let her go i wont let you get away fool im superior blow away you shitty angel damn yooo ooooou low class deeeeeevil uoryaaaaaaaa the gauntlet released all of its energy all the strength gathered in my left arm and i concentrated them on my fist i used that fist to punch straight and accurately at the face of the enemy i detest hit the hard sound echoes my fist is dug into her face and i pushed my fist even further raynare went flying backwards with my punch gashaaaaaaaan the fallen angel crashes into the wall while making a very loud noise the wall broke and there is a big hole in the wall dust starts to spread everywhere when the dust disappears there is nothing left in the direction i punched raynare towards the hole continues till outside of the building where raynare is on the ground she isnt moving i cant tell if she is
dead but she wont be able to move for a while id finally paid her back serves you right im smiling from the bottom of my heart thats my true feeling that punch felt so good but soon tears are falling from my eyes asia she wont s mile ever again part 5 after punching the fallen angel i was about to fall down after using my whole power ton something supports me from my shoulder when i looked its kiba good work you actually beat a fallen angel hes carrying my shoulder with a smile and is supporting me what the even kiba is torn yo you are late casanova fufufu buchou told me not to interfere buchou did thats right i believed that you were able to beat the fallen angel raynare when i turned around to the direction where the voice came from riasbuchou is walking towards me smiling while wavering her crimson hair buchou where did you come from from the basement i finished my business so i used the magic circle to come here it was my first time tra nsporting to a church so i was nervous buchou makes a sigh while talking to
me i see so thats why she came from downstairs with kiba and the others then all of the exorcists are annihilated since they had buchou as their opponent they had no chance of winning then konekochan walks past me where is she going buchou stands front of me looks like you won safely buchou hahaha i won somehow fufufu excellent just what i expected from my servant she taps on my nose ara ara the church is in a mess buchou is it alright akenosan has a troubled face is something wrong i ask buchou timidly churchs belong to god or religions related to him but there are cases like this where it is used by fallen angels in cases like this if we devils damage the church there will be times when we get targeted by assassins for revenge and payback sseriously but it wont happen this time why is that this church was originally an abandoned one so a certain group of fallen angels had come here to use it for their own greed and we just happened to have a fight in a place like that so we didnt step foot on the enemies actual territory
to have war so its just a small fight between a devil and a fallen angel this happens every time thats what happened i see so its a matter of fact of how you sum it up buchou ive brought it the one who appeared while making a sound of dragging something is konekochan she appeared from the broken wall and what she is dragging is a black wing fallen angel raynare so konekochan is dragging the unconscious raynare whom i had punched away but she said she brought it she uses unique words for a small girl thank you koneko now then lets wake her up akeno yes akenosan lifts her hand up then water appears up in the air is that the power of a devil akenosan splashes the water created in the air on raynare splash raynare coughs after the splash the fallen angel wakes up and opens her eyes slowly buchou looks down on her how are you doing fallen angel raynare the daughter of the gremory clan hello my name is rias gremory im the next heir of the house of gremory it will be for a short while but nice to have your acquaintance
buchou greets her with a smile but raynare glares at her then she sneers you think youve got me but too bad this plan was kept secret from the higherups but there are other fallen angels with me if i get in danger they will they wont come to help buchou says it clearly to reject raynares words thats because i already eliminated all three of the fallen angel kalawana fallen angel donaseek and fallen angel mitelt lies raynare rejects what buchou said while sitting up straight buchou takes out three black feathers these are the feathers of those three you can tell them apart since you are the same kind as them right seeing that raynares expression darkens looks like buchou is speaking the truth when i met with the fallen angel donaseek who atta cked ise before i predicted that there were a few fallen angels plotting something in this town i ignored it because i thought it was a plan that involves the whole fallen angel even im not foolish enough to take on all of the fallen angels then i heard that the fallen angels were moving around secretively so i went to talk to them
taking akeno with me when i met them in person they blurted that it was their own plan by helping you they said they would get promoted to a higher status low life that move around secretively for their purpose usually brag about their plots buchou smirks raynare is biting her teeth with frustration they must have looked down on us because it was just two girls who approached them so i asked them as a parting gift fufufu they were foolish fallen angels who didnt know who was going to die since they were willing to help in your pathetic plot they themselves were low beings so thats why the thing buchou needed to take care of was that she took down the o ther remaining fallen angels buchou was thinking about this whole incident as well without knowing it i said so much bad things about her crap im so emotional that i feel like crying getting hit by a single shot wont even leave a trace the pri ncess of the duke who has the power of destruction buchou is a powerful devil who is called a genius among the group of young devils after all kiba
makes a comment to praise his master she is also called the crimson haired ruin princess you know akenosan says it while smiling rruin princess what a scary nickname so that makes me part of the ruin princess group t terrifying buchou looks at my left arm i think shes looking at my gauntlet red dragon until recently there wasnt a mark like this i see so thats what it is is it me or does buchous eyes look like as if shes a bit shocked i found out the main reason why ise was able to beat a fallen angel buchou says it quietly fallen angel raynare this boy hyoudou isseis sacred gear isnt a regular sacred gear thats why you lost raynare has a puzzled face after hearing buchou boosted gear a sacred gear that is said to be the rarest of the rare the red dragon mark on the gauntlet is the evidence even you have heard of that name before right after listening to buchou raynare puts on a very shocked expression bboosted gear one of the longinus even though its for a temporarily time its said that it has the power to surpass maous and
god are you t elling me that hateful power is possessed in a boy like this if its just like the legend is told then the ability of the boosted gear can double the power of the possessor every 10 second even if his power starts from 1 it doubles his power every 10 seconds and it can reach the power of the leaderclass fallen angels and high class devils and by mastering it he could even kill god are you serious buchou i can defeat god so thats the power of my sacred gear there is a mark of a red dragon carved into my gauntlet so the reason why it kept on saying boost boost is because it was doubling my power so thats why my power kept on increasing inside me so the reason why raynare was scared of me is because i had attained a power that surpasses her without realising it what a powerful sacred gear i looked at the sacred gear on my left arm fearfully boosted gear my sacred gear this is an incredible sacred gear ah does this mean i can leave a legend as a devil well no matter how powerful
it is sacred gear which needs time has a big risk there arent any enemies that would wait for the user to get stronger since the opponent was taking it lightly this was the outcome ugh buchou nails it ccertainly there arent that many enemies that will wait for me to get powered up so my sacred gear is powerful but it has many weaknesses buchou approaches me i can smell something nice from her crimson hair patpat buchou starts to pat my head but its interesting just to be expec ted from my servantkun just like i thought ise is an interesting boy im going to adore you even more buchou smiles at me its a nice smile but it looks a bit scary bbuchou what is it buchou is smiling i bow my head down because i feel guilty im sorry when i said i was going to save asia i said rude stuff to you because you wouldnt help but you were helping us behind the scene and i just want to apologise i thought that buchou was a cold hearted devil so i kept on being rude to her so i needed to say how sorry
i am but buchou is still patting my head i was crying without noticing it yes i wasnt able to accomplish my goal bbuchoui couldntprotect asia you dont have to cry seeing you right now there is no one that will blame you butbut i buchou wipes my tears with her fingers its okay you just werent experienced as a devil yet thats all to it become strong im going to make you work hard from now on so be prepared my pawn ise yes i will work hard i will definitely become stronger i promise now then ill finish my last work buchous eyes become sharp and it looks ruthless buchou got close to raynare the fallen angel becomes scared i will have you disappear fallen angel san its a cold tone its filled with killing intent of course i will retrieve that sacred gear back as well yyou cant be serious this healing power is for azazel sama and shemhaza sama to live your life for love is beautiful but you are too tai nted with dirt you have no elegance and i dont allow that buchou aims her hand towards raynare looks like she will kill her

kill me i love you i love you so much thats why lets defeat this devil together raynare once again acts like yuumachan and begs for help to me while crying i was stupid for feeling even a bit sorry for you yuumachan no shitty fallen angel goodbye my love buchou im at my limit will you please hearing that the fallen angels expression froze dont try to flirt with my cute servant blow away don the demonicpower shot by buchou left nothing of the fallen ange l the only thing left is the mysterious feeling i have and the black feathers floating around the church part 6 a green light is floating in the sanctuary its asias sacred gear after raynare was defeated it got released the warm light shines at me buchou takes the light to her hand now lets give this back to asia argento san bbut asia is already yeah asia cant be resurrected anymore after all i couldnt save her i promised to protect her i promised to save her even though i defeat ed the fallen angel it was pointless to come here if i couldnt save her no that would be an insult
to my comrades they fought for me and asia they didnt even get a single benefit from it b buchou everyone thanks for fighting for me and asia bbut still even with all your help asia is ise what do you think this is buchou takes something out from her pocket crimson its a red colour like blood and its a chess piece that has the same colour as buchous hair that is ise this is a bishop chess piece huh i made an idiotic voice because of the sudden answer im late in telling you this now but a devil with a peerage receives 15 chess pieces in total made up of 8 pawns 2 knights 2 bishops 2 rooks and 1 queen same as in an actual chess game i already used one of my bishop but i still have another one left buchou then walks towards asia while holding the crimson chess piece in her hand buchou places the crimson bishop chess piece on the now deceased asias chest the bishops role is to support the other members of the group this girls healing power could be useful as a bishop it never happened before but i
will reincarnate this girl as a devil a crimson demonic power surrounds buchous body i order in my name rias gremory you asia argento i resurrect you back to this soil as my servant and have you reborn as a devil you my bishop be delighted with your new life the crimson chess piece glows and goes inside asias body at the same time asias sacred gear goes back inside her body buchou stops her demonicpower after confirming that the chess piece and the sacred gear went inside asias body then buchou makes a sigh i just look at her in a daze after a short while asia opens her eyes seeing that i wasnt able to stop my tears from coming out huh asias voice the voice that i thought i can never hear again riasbuchou gives me a warm smile i resurrected her because i wante d her power that can even heal a devil fufufu ise from now on youll protect her since you will be her senior devil asia raises her upper body she looks around and finds me ise san i hugged asia who looks puzzled lets go home asia new life part 1 you
have to wake up put some spirit in it i got up from my bed after getting woken up by the alarm clock with a boyish girls voice i set the alarm one hour earlier than usual i needed to go to the club room at all cost even if i have to scratch out my eyes i left the room after getting into my uniform part 2 ara so you came on time when i arrived in the club room buchou was the only one present the school hasnt started yet i came here early in the morning because last evening we were told that we will have a meeting in the morning buchou is sitting on the sofa drinking greentea elegantly good morning buchou yes good morning looks like you have gotten used to the morning yes thanks to you she then looks at my legs hows the wound from the fallen angel i had my thighs pierced by the spear of light from the battle few days ago yes its completely healed thanks to that healing power i answered her with a smile is that so it seems like that girls healing power is something you cant
ignore i can see why a single fallen angel would desire it even by keeping it a secret from her superiors i sit on the sofa opposite buchou there are several things i want to ask her umm buchou if there is the same number of evil pieces as in chess itself then its possible to get 7 other pawns besides me right so will there be a day when another pawn besides me will join us yeah just like in the real chess there should be the same number of pawn pieces so its possible to get more pawn pieces besides me i asked her thinking it will turn out like that one day but buchou shakes her head to the side to my question no my only pawn is you ise eh should i be happy is it a confession something like ise is the only one i want or something like that when reincarnating a human to a devil we use the evil pieces but depending on the ability of the person being reincarnated more evil pieces will be consumed so its not a confession huh piece consumption theres a saying like this in the world of
chess queens have a value of 9 pawns rooks have a value of 5 pawns knights and bishops have a value of 3 pawns each like this there are standard values that also apply to the evil pieces a similar phenomenon happens to those reincarnated if there are those who can only be reincarnated with 2 knight pieces then there are also those who need 2 rook pieces to be reincarnated theres also the compatibility with the pieces as well you cant use 2 separate pieces to give them different roles so its important to think how to use the pieces once you use it devils wont be given a new evil pieces how is that related to me ise i used all of the pawn pieces when i resurrected you if i hadnt i couldnt have made you into a devil all seriously so do i have a value of 8 pawn pieces then when i found out i decided to definitely make you into my servant but i couldnt find the reason for a while but now im c onvinced the sacred gear that is said to be supreme because it was you ise who possess the boosted
gear which is said to be one of the supreme sacred gear the longinus therefore it had that much value i look at my left arm the red gauntlet a insane embodiment of power which doubles my power every 10 seconds depending on how you use it its said that it can even kill god this sacred gear is something which is too good for me but it cant be helped since its residing in me when i was tryin g to reincarnate you the only pieces i had left were 1 knight 1 rook 1 bishop and 8 pawns to make you into my servant i could only use all 8 pieces of pawn and your compatibility with the pawn was also good the other pieces didnt have the power to reincarnate you to begin with the value of pawn is still a mystery also including its promotion thats why i gambled on that possibility as a result you were the best buchou smiles happily she pats my cheeks with her fingers our matching is also great since its crimson and red crimson hair ruin princess and boosted gear ise first of all aim to become the strongest pawn
if its you you can definitely do it after all you are my adorable servant the strongest pawn it sounds so great buchou brings her face closer when i was thinking about it close you are too close buchou then buchous lip touches my forehead this is a good luck charm get stronger kiss on the forehead gura i became unsteady because of what just happened and my face turns red uwa uwa uooooooooooooooooooooo something triggers in my head i am so happy that im about to dance oh man oh man my first kiss from a girl it wasnt a kiss on the lip or cheeks but theres nothing happier than this im about to cry because of the joy i i will work harder buchou i promise with this kiss i definitely will i probably should stop adoring you here the new girl might get jealous of me jealous what is she talking about iisesan voice came from behind me i have heard this voice before when i turned around the blond girl asia is trying to smile aasia eh is she mad wwhy it has to be r riasbuchou is very beautiful so even isesan will also
like her no no i cant think like that oh lord please forgive my sinful heart asia made a prayer but she then screams auu i have a headache of course if a devil makes a prayer to god of course you will receive damage buchou says that normally uu thats right i turned into a devil i cant face god any more asia seems a bit troubled asia please dont make a sad face like that do you regret it buchou asks asia asia shakes her head no thank you very much no matter what situation i am in im happy as long as i am with ise san my face starts to turn red because of her embarrassing reply tthis is something which makes me happy for a guy its the ultimate praise hearing that buchou also smiles i see then its okay from today you will also be my servant and i will make you work along with ise yes i will do my best asia replies very energetically she will have to do the leaflet handing first but i wondered if she will be all right i feel uneasy then i realised the change in asia
why didnt i r ealise it until now asia that uniform yes asia is wearing the school uniform of our school kuoh academys girl uniform ddoes it suit me she asks me shyly of course another angel have descended to our school i can already hear the guys in our school talking about it you look great in it its the best lets take a photo with only the 2 of us eh y yes she was troubled with how to react but its true that she looks cute in it aaah my school life is becoming glorious i decided to make asia attend our school since she is about the same age as you shes also in 2nd year i also made her in the same class as you today will be her first day so make sure to look after her buchou says that to me are you serious my class asia will be in my class i will be in your care ise san asia bows her head i start to imagine introducing asia to matsuda and motohama already i cant stop laughing thinking about how jealous they would get yeah i will introduce you to two
of my pals yes im looking forward to it fufufu matsuda and motohama looks like im getting closer to becoming an adult pals my life as an unpopular guy is over while i was imagining that kiba konekochan and akenosan enters the room good morning b uchou isekun asia san good morning buchou ise senpai asia senpai how are you all doing buchou ise kun asia chan everyone greets us everyone called me ise and acknowledged asia as a member its great theres nothing better than this buchou stands up since everyone is here shall we start the party saying that buchou clicks her fingers then a big cake appears on the table wow is this also demonicpower as well it might be good sometimes to gather in the morning to do these kinds of things right s since we got new members i made some cake so lets eat it together buchou says it shyly but handmade cake i will gladly eat it buchou first of all i will aim to become the strongest pawn i will work hard along with buchou asia kiba konekochan and akenosan after making a promise to myself i got ready to do kamehameha
to rise up the mood for this party afterword the last boss of this book is the dragon king of darkness black satan who holds a grudge against the main character its going to end with a fierce fight where the main character uses his ultimate technique chaos of shot and the last boss uses dark breath type 0 where the last boss gets defeated at the end the main character and the heroine fly up the sky heading for their love this is how this book will be hahaha i spoiled it for those who read the afterword first its a lie im sorry no one like that will appear in this book i got carried away because there are those who read the afterwor d first and im not regretting it hello its ishibumi ichiei how was high school dd also called dd im feeling nervous because its been two years since i last published a book possibly due to being nervous my hand started shaking so the afterword begun with a suspicious introduction for those who are reading my book for the first time may think whats wrong with this author oppai oppai which oppai planet did
you come from and for those people who had read my work previously will be like huh this is written by the horror author ishibumi right what happened to him oppai so it may have been a shocking book for some of you many things happen to adults you know well please think that i changed my writingstyle this time the story will be very lively and erotic overall thats because the editor in charge said lets make the main character into a lecherous guy it was fun writing it i was also having fun doing it the main characters of harem series are usually the skinny ones or guys with a strong sense of justice but who lack in these departments so i made the main character into a guy who loves girls and is really stupid the story is also from ises perspective so i made it in a way where the reader will be like no thats wrong think a little bit ise isnt smart like all of you so he is super dumb so please watch over him with warm eyes well it seems like there are a few more pages left for the afterword so
i will talk about the outline of this series high school dxds genre is school lifel ovecomedybattlefantasy and its about how hyoudou issei rises up its long but im sure those people who have read this already know the names of the genres the main character is ise the secondarymain character and the main heroine is rias buchou and asia is the other heroine its a story about the main character and the two heroines basically this story will revolve around these three where kiba konekochan and akenosan causes destruction the occult research club members the servantdevils of rias gremory use kuoh academy as their base and do their jobs as devils while they make a slapstick fighting angels and fallen angels and getting in contact with legendary beasts and items well thats the plan the concept of this series is that love dream and battles are also part of being a youth devils and angels are the main theme so during the story names of those from myths and legend will appear but this series is written where it wont be restricted by them in other words the events written in the bible and nonfiction books are just used
for references and the author that is me writes it freely with an original story just think that the majority of things related to angels and devils are made up in dd well theres no way tha t the word evil pieces will appear in the bible the war between the three factions devils god and fallen angels has ended few hundred years ago and the story revolves around the devils and angels after that war it starts off from where most of the famous angels and devils have already passed away well there are other things in my mind for example bringing stuff from norse mythology and also from japanese youkai basically its a setting where anything is possible im sure that there are those w ho hold both doubts and hopes for rias buchous servants after reading this volume for example who is the other bishop that buchou already has i have already decided with my editor to make that person appear as the story progresses so im sure that pe rson will appear if this series continues on also will the other pieces be filled up buchou has 1 knight and 1 rook piece left similar to
the bishop i will fill this in if this series continues huh its not explained well no no i already have them prepared so i just need the support of everyone the release of volume 2 will be decided on the sales of volume 1 but high school dxd will get more erotic if it goes on mainly rias buchou and asia in volume 2 im planning to do a really ama zing part i mean amazing but it might end in a dream so please support me if you are looking forward to buchous oppai now to my thanks to my former editor in charge who brought this discussion to me ksama and to the current editor in charge who has been by my side the whole time hsama thank you very much for looking after me thanks to that high school dxd has been released i want to say it to the both of you again thank you very much to miyamazerosan who did the illustrations thank you for the beautiful illustrations i was moved because buchou and asia were drawn just like i imagined sorry for making you really busy with the designs of the uniform and
the appearance of the characters and to the authors who debuted at the same time as me i have really made you guys worried thank you for cheering me up every time we went drinking thanks to that im back in action and to my friends sorry for troubling you guys i somehow managed to release a book thanks for cheering me up last ye ar lets go out to eat next time my thanks ends here thank you to my editor the authors and my friends thank you very much i will work hard so this series will continue on oh and i also do a blog i started it last year so please feel free to visit any time well i only talk about pokemon and gundam well im thinking that it will be good if i can sometime talk about dd ichibumi ichieis blog ichibui httpishibumiexblogjp lastly theres something i want to say to a certain person its only few lines so please forgive me to my father who passed away when i was preparing for volume 1 dad i was able to release my book safely sorry for making you worry ishibumi ichiei translators notes and

am wearing a set of red armour and actually screaming which is no act while running away from a deadly attack of demonic power every single attack is so insane the last had so much impact that it destroyed a mountain and blew away the forest with it yes i hyoudou issei am fighting a magical girl on a mountain no this is more like a onesided assault thats because my opponent isnt a magical girl but a real maou girl i will have to go back to explain how it turned out like this after summer break ended and the second semester began ise its an emergency that day i was called by buchou while playing a trading card game1 with the other club members what is it i asked and buchou answered with a smile i received a request from a maousama personally its from serafall leviathansama maou yes we received a request from one of the yondaimaou who are the kings of devils are you serious if its leviathansama then im honouredi shouted with joy of course the one who is the only woman within the yondaimaou is leviathansama i feel honoured receiving a request from maousama
though shes one of those weird people shes requesting to borrow koneko gasper and xenovia while ise is the main buchou continued gasper screamed hiiiiiiii mme too ii dont like to stand out aaah he said that while running inside a box since this guy has anthropophobia and is a hikikomori he is bad at standing out but why us xenovia pointed to herself konekochan was also nodding her head it seems like she is in need of your special powers buchou answered special powers i havea powerful dragon residing within me gasper carries vampire blood konekochan is a nekomata youkai and xenovia can wield a holy sword now that i think about it we are quite a bunch of special ones buchou said while stroking my cheek i want to go with you but akeno and i have to leave here for special business well have yuuto guard us i have already told this to leviathansama so that wont be a problem asia you will also follow ise it will be a good experience for you yes i will be going with isesan asia nodded at buchous words so thats the story i will now leave the rest to
you since i have to escort buchou and akenosan said kiba ngggh buchous escort damn you casanova hes a lucky guy but it cant be helped since he is buchous genuine knight munyuuni then felt a soft sensation the one holding me is akenosan aaaaaah i couldnt resist this sensation akenosan said seductively while stroking my lips with her fingers it saddens me that i have to be away from you but responding to the maousama is something my isekun would do yyes i replied energetically while having a nose bleed due to her words my heart skipped a beat pinch pinching my cheek is a loving hand that belongs to buchou my master buchou becomes unpleasant when i get along with other women it appears that she cant endure having me taken away by anyone since she adores me i really am happy for being her servant either way make sure you arent rude yyessss i nodded several times while having my cheek pinched that was how the five of us me asia konekochan xenovia and gasper received a request from maousama part 2 so on a sunny day we travelled via a teleporting magic circle and arrived on
the beach of an unpopulated island there are no places where a ship could dock and the shore is surrounded by rough rocks you couldnt even find a sandy beach the scenery of this island is mostly dominated by forests and mountains it definitely seems like an isolated island within a distant sea i can hear animal cries giii giii by the way apparently this is also part of japan remind me where is maousama as we looked arounddon don don don the ground is shaking and we are affected by the tremors wwhats going on a giant creature appears while pushing down trees i dont know why but its a dinosaur that looks very much like a tyrannosaurus rex wait is it a trex yoohoo servants of riaschan its leviatan a cutelooking person riding on top of the trex greeted us shes wearing magical girl cosplay yes this person is none other than the maou serafall leviathansama stop stop leviathansama treated the trex like a horse and stopped right in front of us tou she jumped off the trex and spun around in midair while dropping herself to the ground bang leviatan landed facefirst on the ground having failed
to land on her feet her panties were exposed maousamas panties shes wearing striped panties she got up immediately and smiled while making a peace sign at us with her fingers but her face is covered in dirt be amazed serafall leviathan at your service she has overwhelmingly high tension and an easy going attitude as always even when i met her before at school she was having a photo shoot this serafall leviathansama over here loves japanese magical girl shows and she looks up to the magical girl genre she even has a glittering magical stick in her hand iits been a while leviathansama so what was the reason for you to call us over i made the introduction short and got to the main point what was her reason for calling us to this isolated islandi called all of you over to help us shoot our film she explained to us posing film as we were shocked people carrying filming equipment came running as if they were following the trex so they really are shooting a film did they prepare this dinosaur for the film as well serafallsama scene 21 the magical girl who gets friendly with the
ancient dinosaur we got a good shot for it from amongst the crew a middleaged man wearing a hat and sunglasses appeared holding a megaphone he looks like a typical director so is this person the director then more than that ive never heard of a magical girl who became friendly with an ancient dinosaur before maousama then told the director directorsan these children are the ones i spoke to you about oh i see so they are the gremory group who achieved an outstanding result in the rating game they know us game huh if i remember it was said that our match the gremory group vs the sitri group was broadcast within the whole world of the devilsthe whole area of the underworld well the thing is this film directorsan over here thought this is it when he saw the fights of all of you from riaschans group thats why he gave all of you this offer maousama explained offer so we are going to have a film debut the director also speaks while nodding his head the truth is we are currently shooting a film version of serafallsamas tokusatsu programme magicalleviatan aimed at children we would like
all of you to appear as her enemies mmagicalleviatan you say i became confused after hearing the name of a show i had never heard of butit is basically like a tokusatsu hero programme that is currently highly praised in the underworld its quite popular among children konekochan explains to me i see a tokusatsu programme in the underworld so this will be an underworld version of those masked hero tokusatsu films being broadcast in japan though this one has a magical girl as its theme the setting is about me leviatan who is the ally of devils and fights against angels fallen angels dragons and those related to the church i will be annihilating all the enemies of devils at once maousama made a cute pose but those words are only filled with danger angels and fallen angels have been the natural enemy of devils for an eternity but we finally managed to make peace with them is it really okay to have such an antigovernment setting when i asked the director smiled and laughed fearlessly it is my motto to include an antigovernment message within my work this is supposed to be a programme directed at kids hes
using it as propaganda adults sure are scary is this really okay leviatan but why us i asked an obvious question buchou is from a noble house and her household is known throughout the underworld however we her servants arent actors but mere devils on top of that we are lowclass devils if i remember correctly buchou was saying something about our special powers is that the reason for this the director then says while putting his thumb up after all you are a legendary dragon a holy sword wielder a vampire and a nekomata youkai yes its filled with the rivals of devils on top of that all of you are known throughout the underworld from the recent match all of you are being talked about a lot that is why i asked for all of you to act as the enemies of leviatan so he made this offer including the members of our group while taking into account that we are currently quite topical we have so much variety within our group so we will be maousamas enemies thenthis seems interesting oh xenovia seems like shes up for it iim scaredbut since its maousamas request the timid gasper
also agreed while hiding behind my back are the two of you also fine with this asia konekochan though i think we have to do it when i asked both of them yes i will do my best yes if they are okay with having me they gave me their approval im also fine with it rather now that i think about it wont this open a path for me to become an actor i might become popular with this film i might also become popular amongst females in the underworld i then imagined myself receiving cheers from fan girls while being protected by guards kyaaa isesama look this way aaaan you are just too awesome cheers which are being thrown iim so happy hey another one fainted with joy again a girl faints and security guards take her away i then smile at this sight fufufu im such a sinner the girls make cheers once again at my cool posing gufufu awesome something like that sure would be awesome that would be the best maybe then i can take the fan girls and no no maybe getting along with an actress in the underworld being caught during our secret
date and having it on a magazine might also be good ah i cant stop imagining it my dream is to become a harem king by becoming a highclass devil but becoming an actor and being popular with girls might not be a bad thing eitherthen i can do things like this to the gravure idol in the underworld and i then made a gesture of poking oppai with my fingers and i started drooling stomp konekochan steps heavily on my foot ouch ouch ouch imagining indecent things is forbidden konekosama is strict as always i wiped my drool and answered the director roger that we the servants of rias gremory happily accept the offer of acting as the enemies in the film that is how our appearance in the film was decided part 3 itsheavy gashan gashan the sound of metal colliding the filming began as soon as we agreed to appear in the movie and we are currently inside a forest i changed into a costume that was given to me its redplated armour apparently this is an imitation of boosted gear scale mail since transforming has so many requirements mainly my limited time in balancebreak it was
decided that i would use this imitation this armour happens to be heavy it really is a mass of metal apparently it is made using devils technology and even though it is very hard they made it as light as possible it also happens to have a high resistance to impacts and it is really heavy the quality of the imitation is high it can also emit sounds from the jewels and slide open the mask as welli dont have a feeling that my armour is heavy when i transform but i realise it must be really heavy when i wear this thing giii giii mysterious cries can be heard again man its scaaaaaary like the time with that dinosaur i really cant predict what exists in here this place definitely isnt japan isesan asias voice when i turned around ddo i look good in it asia is standing there wearing a costume equipped with ominous accessories asia what is that costume yes its supposed to be a costume for the priestess who worships the red dragon emperor oh so shes a priestess if you think about it she does look like onedoes she when an innocent asia wears such
an ominous costume it gives me mixed feelings apparently i am the evil holy sword wielder xenovia appears oh that sure looks like a costume belonging to an amazon which seems quite easy to move in her skin is exposed so much that its feeding my eyes but an evil holy sword wielder fufufu it might be a fitting role for a former christian like myself who became a devil on a whim aaah there she goes again this girl has started to think and wonder about unreasonable things again and im a maid this time its konekochan wait this is shes wearing a maid costume while having her cat ears and tail released it has an overwhelming impact when konekochan who is small wears it shes so cuteme in plate armour asia in an evillooking priestess costume xenovia in a amazon holy sword wielder costume and konekochan in a nekomata maid costume hmm there is so much variety in our group it really is an unrealistic enemy role for leviatan for the setting i am an evil dragon which was sealed within this island konekochan and the others are from an enemy organisation who decided to make their move
to resurrect the dragon this story is about leviatan coming to this island in order to stop their plan well that is a completely typical setting for a childrens programme where is gyakun konekochan looks around ah that guy gasper is not here he was supposed to be positioned somewhere acting as a vampire what kind of costume is he wearing iim here gaspers voice i can hear his voice but i cant see him when i look around iim here when i looked in the direction the voice came frommy sight stopped at a single large box there are two holes in the box and there are red eyes shining from within dont tell me this is hhey gyasuke dont tell me you will be appearing in that when i asked i hear a lively voice from within the box yyes when they were choosing my costume i ran inside this box and the directorsan who saw that this is new alright we will position you as a danball vampire and thats how it isand thats how it is what the heeeeeeell gasper indeed has a habit of hiding inside a box but is it really okay for them
to make him act in this are you really okay with this your face wont appear you know you will stand out in a weird way but are you really okay with this yes he answers me with a lively voice yeah i really dont understand whats going on this is such an insane cast they added a danball vampire on top of the cast i mentioned earlier im so scared that we will get complaints from the world of vampires for making a box a vampire without making him show himself wouldnt it be faster to use a normal box and alter it using cg afterwards everyone after all of you look through the script we will move onto filming we got an announcement from the staff well this is how the filming began i can only feel uneasy about this scene a leviatan vs nekomata youkai danball vampire just like that the filming began first leviatan is flying through a forest where evil beasts reside using her devil wings leviatan i wont let you go past here konekochan who is acting as the enemy nekomatamaid appears just as the director wanted to have her act as she naturally
would konekochan was behaving like her usual self without any acting at all you must be one of those who are trying to resurrect the legendary red dragon emperor what are you planning to do by waking up the dragon emperor sleeping within this forest wow leviathansama sure is in high spirits its none of your business if you are planning to get in our way we will just have to eliminate youkonekochan makes her stand konekochan you sure have good acting skills tou leviabeam leviathansama shoots out a beam from her magical stick wow so they wont be using cg for these parts magicalleviatan basically doesnt use any cg we try to get attention by having her act using her actual demonic powers the staff explain to me due to my shocked expression it sure is convenient the power of devilsthe demonic power that is apparently that demonic power is one used by leviathansama only for acting purposes so even if you are hit the impact isnt that serio dooooooooooooon an explosive sound occurred in the direction the beam headed and the trees were blown away that has an insane power for acting purpose with that she didnt do
it seriously but that is still a beam from a maou of course it will have insane power wait konekochan is in danger just as i became concerned for konekochan you wont be able to take me down with that konekochan had swiftly dodged it to be expected from a nekomata amazing to be expected from a gremory servant the director was also applauding more than that what would they have done if she couldnt dodge that yeah i shouldnt think too much about that but will i be okay if i get hit by that i just have to believe in this plate armour which was specially made im glad there isnt an action scene in this story for asia for asia who just has soso reflexes she would die if she gets hit by those beams without doing anythingthen one of those beams hits konekochan this is bad i was in shockbut it doesnt appear that konekochan took any critical damage also her clothes werent blown away its okay serafallsama weakens her attack when it hits others the staff explains to me once again iis that so thats good in other words the attacks which could be dodged
by the actors have power in them while she minimises the damage on the attacks that hit them i would cry if konekochan was blown away ugh konekochan acts by dropping on her knees the cat youkaisan now will you still fight me leviatan points her magical stick at konekochan then ssstop right there gaspers voice echoesand a box appears in front of leviatan its a cardboard box it seriously is only a cardboard box iii aaaaaaaaam a vampire oh man hes so nervous that he couldnt say his lines properly it cant be helped for gasper who shuts himself in his room starring in a film is something you call cruel it appears he is only just able to act by hiding himself inside the box unlike the nnnnnnnekomata iiii before gasper could say any more flap a giant black shadow comes into the filming area wow its a huge bird monster is this also part of the film giigiiah so that weird sound i heard when i came to this island belongs to that suspicious bird the giant bird grips onto gasper in the box with its claws and giigii it flew up into the sky this is
also acting huh hey hey that guy gasper was taken away high into the sky is that bird leviatans familiar or something that bird what is that no idea then the staff and the director had an ominous conversation eeeeeeeeeh is this an accident gaspeeeeeeeer my scream echoes high through the sky gasper disappears into the sky together with that giant bird i then imagined in my head seeing gaspers smiling face in the sky later that day i was told that the giant bird is a legendary creature which is called the the magicalbird of the heavenly sky ziz why is such a famous creature on this island and was he the only one taken away i only have doubts about this but for now i will make sure i never forget about gasper who was taken away for the rest of my life scene b leviatan vs holysword wielder danball vampire shogun hiiiiiiiiiiiin it felt as though i was being lifted up my body felt as if it was being taken up all of a sudden after that gasper was rescued safely and he was crying inside the box by the way that scene was invaded by the
sudden intrusion of a giant bird but since it was an interesting scene they gave it an okay it seems the director was deeply moved by the cardboard box vampire who was taken away by the giant bird so much so that he immediately decided to use gasper again for the next scenewell this guy is the only danball vampire in the world who ever flew up into the sky being taken away by the giant bird after all rather than that when i looked at the script i realised that gaspers role was changed into a danball vampire shogun when on earth did he get a classchange can you gain enormous experience points when you get taken to an island or something then the location changed to mysterious ruins it seems like they prepared this whole ruin with stone carvings for today leviatan and the holy sword wielder aka xenovia fight there i lend my holy sword ascalon to xenovia she still cant control the power of durandal yet and since the destructive power of it is insane it wouldnt be a matter of filming any more holy sword wieldersan move aside from there i cant let you awaken
the dragon emperor fufufu like i will let you do that xenovia she totally sounds like she is acting wwell it cant be helped since we are basically amateurs here i come bring it both of them move quickly and they were making sparks fly using a sword and a magical staff wow its such an amazing battle they are a maousama and a swordswoman after all i can watch this safely im also shocked at the magical stick which can cope against ascalon is this something i should have expected from a magical stick belonging to a maou girl leviatan shoots several shots of demonic power which are meant for filming while xenovia dodges or slices them with the holy sword even the staff were looking at them seriously because of their swift actions and movements for this scene rather than using crappy dialogue it would be better to lure viewers with action so we are getting the perfect shot for this scenethe battle enters the climax and leviatans demonic power finally blows away xenovias holy sword the holy sword which was blown away penetrates the earth ku you are strong leviatan as usual xenovia is bad at acting
she lacks intensity but then the scene which was added comes in right away vampire please save me xenovia calls for help the added scene will have gasper in the box come and save xenovia who is in danger the camera focuses on the position where gasper is located then munch munch there is a trex which is munching and eating the box gasper is in gasper is being eateeeeeen gaspeeeeeeer my scream echoes through the filming area once again gasper i want to carry on the courage you showed me scene c final battle of leviatan resurrected the legendary dragon emperor danball vampire god fueeeeeeeeeeeeee it was stinky the dinosaurs mouth was so warm and wet it was scary when he was munching on me after that gasper who was safely rescued was crying inside the new box he was given about the scene where the box was eaten by the dinosaur again it was decided to put that scene in the film apparently they decided to add gasper in the last scene as well i dont get it is that director planning to make a film which has a box as the main character i also think he
is a new kind of box since he wasabducted by a bird and was eaten by a dinosaur but if it was me i wouldnt want to watch it they will definitely be criticised by the vampire world in the script it now has danball vampire god added to it do you get upgraded to godclass when you get devoured by a dinosaur it feels like he is in a higher class then me who is going to become the last boss of this film its going to turn into a scene where the box will be going at leviatan but leviathansama is its going to turn into the best film there is the part where you cant predict how the story will end will be the key point for its success yeah i also cant predict whats going to happen no one will be thinking that they will be shown a movie about a box when they were planning to watch leviatans film will the children enjoy a film where a box is getting along with a bird and dinosaur danballkun i will send your lines to you the directorsan writes something for gasper in the box what he
wrote was fall angels disappear fallen angels and dangerous messages like that which will be antigovernment messages please dont say those things in a kids film especially with a vampire in a box saying that youll just turn many factions into our enemies i protested against the director we are turning into actors for such an outrageous antigovernment film i dont want this to be a mere childrens film this film will change the world dont change it i ended up arguing with the director what kind of film is this going to turn into well that doesnt matter it will be my scene from here i checked my lines after asia finishes her prayers at the altar there will be a glow and then i have to appear along with an explosion and smokefufufu im going to make myself stand out so much that i will turn into the best actor there is i dont care whether this is an antigovernment film it will be okay as long as i stand out in the future im going to have lots of sex with beautiful actresses what is standing out in the scene for the final battle is a big
statue of a dragon in front of that there is a ritual taking place to remove the seal on the dragon emperor and asia who is acting as an evil priestess is saying her prayer dragon emperorsama dragon emperorsama please hear my evil wishes please defeat leviatan with all of your mighty evil power it sounds like she is totally acting but asiachan looks so cute when she is doing her best acting i want to pat her after this after her prayer leviatan appeared and so this is the place where the dragon emperor is sealed ah the prayers have already started this is bad then she confronts asia stop your prayers now leviatan makes a stance with the magical stick asia stood up while lifting her arms up high now after asias next lines the dragon statue is going to split in half and then i will show myself i will be stationed behind the statue im nervous but im going to do my best i did memorise my lines somehow rather i want to end this and take this armour off its heavy its hot in here and this is the worst aaah dragon emperorsama now is
the time for your resurrection after this the statue splits flash a flash occurs and the statue splits open going to the sides while making a gogogogogoogogo sound alright now is my timei leapt forward from behind the statue and through some smoke fuhahahahahahaha i am the red dragon emperor i received the prayers of the evil ones and i have resurrected once again into this world fuhahahahahahaha first i will destroy the underworld where the devils who sealed me are living i laughed loudly yup i think my appearance was right the director didnt say cut either leviatan appears in front of me and points her stick at me so you have finally awoken dragon emperor i wont let you go to the underworld i will obliterate you right here fuhahahahahahaha its foolish for a single devil girl to oppose this dragon emperor very well i will make you into a bloodbath first i sure am hyped in this maybe acting as an enemy might be fun after this leviatan and i started the fight ummm if i remember correctly this armour is supposed to be equipped with a demonic power output and a flamethrower i was trying to
prepare for a battle but leviatan started to gather huge demonic powers to her magical stick right in front of me the wave of demonic powers is making the atmosphere shake and it gave me a feeling of being in huge danger hhuh is it just me or is that demonic power a bit too strong it has so much demonic power that it is dangerous no matter how you look at it it seems like it has too much attack power in it dragon emperor i shall defeat you the next moment the huge demonic power which was released from her stick with so much deadly power explodes around me i was caught in the explosion and was sent flying into the sky part 4 getting back to the storyi was running around while making sounds with the armour ill be killed leviathansama is releasing quite a strong demonic power towards me i then see the message card that the staff is showing me this is an important scene for the final battle so both of you will be shooting at each other a bit seriously a bit seriously you say my opponent is a maou you know her
demonic power when she is being a bit serious is so powerful that it changes the appearances of the mountains the island is being grazed away every time i dodge her attacks stay still fight me head on leviatan comes after me im going to be killed look look look there are dangerous amounts of dangerous demonicpowers gathering at her stick doooooooooooon the earth was blown away with the shot she released uwaah there is a huge crater made in the ground where it hit ah there is a crack on this armour which was supposed to have a strong resistance to impacts like i thought it doesnt have a defence which can withstand a maous attack huh it turned out like this with just a shockwave if i was to get hit by it directly i will be blown to pieces there isnt any cut call yet what is the meaning of this no matter how you look at it this is a onesided massacre when i looked in the directors directionhe nodded his head very strongly and gave me a thumbs up eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh this is okay i was so shocked that my eyes popped out but leviatans attack
doesnt stop at all i only had the choice of running around however the film wont be done properly if i just keep on running around i made my mind up and turned around i then tried to use the demonicpower output and flame thrower booooooon pyunpyunfrom the head of my armour a flame thrower released a fire which was like a mere burner and it released a couple of softballsized demonic power from my right hand and it ended with just that this is itttttttt impossible there is no way i can win with just this i was in shock and noticed another message card we will alter this scene a bit with cg afterwards to make it proper what do you mean by making it proper this is over this tokusatsu film is hopeless to be expected from the dragon emperor such an amazing attack but i wont lose aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah leviathansama is also speaking as if i did an amazing attack so its decided that my attack earlier will be modified with cg huh take this a powerful shot comes at me and doooooooooooooooon the demonic power released from her stick blows me away marvellously gufu because i
was caught in the explosion i was spinning around numerous times in mid air i tried hard to stand up and run away after i fell down on the ground my whole body hurts my armour also lost its shape at this rate i will be killed since there isnt any cut call it means that filming is still continuing ssenpai gaspers voice when i looked in the direction the voice came from there was a box gyagyasuke i made my battered body move and approached gasperku my wounds hurt fufufu i wasnt able to defeat leviathansama when i crawled in front of the box i poked in my shivering finger into a hole in the box i have blood on my finger because of a minor wound suck my blood with that you will be able to power up i released a shivering voice no my consciousness is disappearing ssenpai ii gasper maybe this era is waiting for a box like yourself please avenge me on behalf of the gremory group i dropped flat on the ground while having my finger inside the hole this is bad i cant move any more senpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaai uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa gaspers scream after that gasper
started to suck my finger chupa chups ah it feels so warm inside gaspers mouth i started to think such a bl thing while i was losing my consciousness don while my vision was blurry i understood that the box was enveloped in a abnormal aura it seems like gasper released his power after sucking my bloodleviatan i will be your opponent when gasper said thatthe box flew up very wildly while observing the rare scene of a box changing its direction many times in the air it heads towards leviatan very fast what movements is this the power of a danball vampire god leviatan was also surprised by gaspers movements both of them fly around in the air and they were having a fierce battle ah the danball box was moving swiftly in the air while dodging leviatans demonic power attacks then the box does a body attack at the maou girl while moving rapidly leviatan and a danball box started to have a fierce battle in the sky of this island aamazingi never knew that a box is able to fight a maou film that box you wont be able to film a thing like this ever again
that box is amazing its flying and its fighting a maou the director was also overjoyed fufufu gasper you can actually do it when you try i lost my consciousness while observing a courageous side of my junior a dragon emperor which is lower than a danball box falls here part 5 that is how magicalleviatan defeated a powerful foe the danball vampire god and brought peace to the underworld the screening of premium filming session we the gremory group were observing the film magicalleviatan attack of the danball vampire god in a huge theatre along with buchou and the others who couldnt participate in it the last narration just ended and along with that the film thank you thank you leviathansama who was up on the stage was receiving applause from and responding to the audienceall of me asia konekochan and xenovia appeared in the film but the box gasper stood out the most even the title of the film the attack of the red dragon emperor was changed after all those related to the film industry were praising the new way of using a box and its movement they were saying things such as this film is the
best boxrelated film of the year and such it seems gasper has received offers from many directors already of course for acting as danball that is i really cant understand the world of devils its quite a good film ise and all of you did very well especially gasper who was amazing our master buchou was overjoyed at the efforts of her servants i feel complicated but since buchou is happy this is an okay result uumm isesan asia calls me whats wrong asia there are girls who became isesans fans after watching the film they are asking for a handshake what i see fufufu so my charm was finally realised by the girls through that film this is an okay start for my career as an actor very well my fan girls now jump into my arms gashan gashan gashan gashan what appeared in front of me was a plate armour and a musha armour eh what are these it seems they are armour monsters konekochan explains yyeah what do these armour monsters want with me these people are girls and it appears that they became fans after seeing isesan in armoureeeeeeeeeeeeeeh these are girls impossible gasahan the armour
monsters hug me guha ouch ouch ouch this cold and hard feeling of metal starts to destroy both my body and soul i will never appear in a film ever again my scream echoes throughout the cinema thus my summer filming experience ended with me being popular with armour monsters later this film also became quite known and talked about as a film that i the oppai dragon appeared in before being a major hitlife2 ise sos part 1 it happened right after we helped out with leviathansamas film that day buchou had raised her eyebrows at the guest who came to visit the clubroom riassan i have a favour to ask you will you allow me to borrow hyoudou isseikun the one who asks with a mighty attitude is the captain of the tennis club abe kiyomesenpai during the course of a tennis match in the first semester there was trouble between our clubs buchou answers while narrowing her eyes i feel like rejecting the favour when you are the one asking me but i will still listen to what you have to say yeah abesenpai challenged us to a match making me the prize if she won it
resulted in us the occult research club winningbut the match turned into the worst thing for me and it is something i can never forget it seems abesenpai is interested in the power of the sekiryuutei within me is that the reason today as well abesenpai continues while not knowing what is going through my mind the truth is my father will be returning from his travels i want hyoudoukun to help me help her me ara ara bullying our isekun wont be allowed you know aaah akenosan sure is kind im deeply moved this helping out might turn into a flag for his death the one giving such an ill omen is konekochan give me a break konekochan you are thinking that you have to help someone in need correctthe one who said that with such gentle words is asia so what is this problem that requires ises help buchou asks abesenpai once again my father is telling me to have a marriage meeting im still a high school student i told him that he is rushing it but he wont listen to me my father is someone who makes sure he follows through once he has made a
decision hmm a marriage meeting hearing her story the handsome guy of our club kiba nods his head i see abesenpai comes from a monster tamer household with an ancient and honourable origin so your parents decided to choose your groom immediately right thats exactly right to be expected from kibakun yes this person is a monster tamer my body shivers because i recalled a nasty memory hearing that xenovia speaks to the nearby box gasper she seems to be a monster tamer dont you think you are the most fitting to be her consultant since you are a vampire hearing xenovia i heard hiiiiiii screamed from the box i dont want tooooo i wont be of any uuuusssee gasper the hikikomori went inside a box today because he was scared of meeting abesenpai whom he never met before its basically a secret to other students at our school that we the members of the occult research club are devils since abesenpai has a secret under the table agreement she knows about our situation as a special privilege aside from abesenpai there are those in the grade school junior high school high school kindergarten and university that know about the
existence of devils i havent met them much but buchou and sonakaichou know about them though the majority of those are humanswith special powers or those who come from households with special backgrounds buchou asks while making a sigh so you want ise to interfere in your marriage meeting or something abesenpai nods her head yes i want hyoudoukun to act as my boyfriend i have already informed my father that i have a boyfriend and that i dont want to have a marriage meeting then he told me if thats the case he is willing to cancel the marriage meeting under certain conditions i just need him for that day and arara i feel like im suddenly receiving hostility now senpai is feeling chills when i looked around all of the girls were glowering dangerously at abesenpai wwhats wrong everyone isesenpai as her boyfriend that cant be even i still havent i wont allow it yeah you are right asia akenosan konekochan and xenovia have such a low tone that its scary will buchou also get mad buchou adores me as if im a kitten so maybe she wouldnt like me sticking my nose in something dangerous maybe the
conditions abesenpai got from her dad involves me working hard or something thats what i thought but unexpectedly buchou puts her hand on her mouth and it seems as if she is thinking hmm she doesnt appear to be angry she glanced at me once and then said to abesenpai all right i will accept that request by receiving a price equal to it all the club members were shocked at buchous unexpected answer hence it was decided that i would act as abesenpais boyfriend in order to break off her marriage meetingmore than that i wonder what is the required condition for breaking off the marriage meeting i only have bad feelings about this part 2 the next saturday we the gremory group were called over to abesenpais home i am the one who came to do some work but including buchou everyone is worried about me sob having comrades sure is wonderful im deeply moved when we arrived at senpais residence there was a giant westernstyle house in front of us the garden is huge and the interior of the house is also magnificent it seems senpai lives here by herself most of the time both her parents
are famous monster tamers who travel around the world for their work when she thought her father had returned after a long while the matter of her engagement came up well this summer my house was also renovated into a gorgeous mansion with buchous selfindulgence it is six storeys high and three storeys below ground the place we were guided to after walking the corridor connecting the westernstyle building to another building was the indoor pool we changed into swimsuits that had been prepared for us and headed towards the pool uoooooo buchou and akenosan are wearing swimsuits that have so much exposureeeee their oppai are bouncing every time they move asia and konekochan are wearing cute looking swimsuits with frills on them xenovia is wearing a swimsuit used by athletic swimmers looking at the girls in swimsuits sure does feed my eyes even my junior gasper is also wearing a cute looking swimsuit you dont have to wear it i told him just in case well it does look good on him since he looks like a girliyan bbut if i wear the boys swimsuit my breasts will be exposed and something outrageous will happen who would be happy
at mens tits oh well i should stop mucking around with my junior here this way abesenpai urges us to go to the table by the pool side everyone gathered around the table and senpai explained the requirements needed to break off the marriage meeting once again the requirements my father mentioned are battle contests as monster tamers and what do you mean by that when i asked abesenpai answers using her fingers a battle of three matches using land sea and sky monsters if hyoudoukun wins twice or more against my father the marriage meeting will be cancelled land sea and sky you say even if you say that im not a monster tamer im not actually confident its me who hasnt gotten a familiar yet you know and they are asking me to suddenly have a match while using monsters and also win hmm wont this be quite hard when i was thinking while twitching my head abesenpai points elsewhere its not a problem the monsters we would be using are already chosen first of all the land monster come out hokyooooooon my body became stiff at the familiar howl and drumming ddont tell me what appeared in
front of us is a giant white gorillaaaaaa so its this thing after all shes looking at me with passionate eyesuho for the land battle it will be her the yukionna christie thats why can you please stop calling that snow gorilla a yukionna my fantasy is being crushed everyone did you know the yukionna of this world isnt a beautiful youkai in a kimono with a bewitching expression but a white gorilla with a huge build which is right in front of me this is christie a yetifemale i dont want to call her a yukionna when i had a tennis match against abesenpai in the past i fought this snow gorilla while pairing up with buchou i sure did suffer in that match because of her freezing breath i dont want to remember it maybe she hasnt realised it but her fur is brighter than the last time i saw her buchou says as if she finds it something to be praised fur is something which is nothing to be hyped about isnt it its a gorilla a gorilla i tell ya for the land battle i want hyoudoukun to use this christie and battle against the monster
my father would be using you are telling me to use this goristie uho dont look at me with such emotional eyes damn it it seems like this thing got a crush on me because of the tennis match in the past i detest the world i will call the sea monster next its a mermaid when abesenpai clicks her fingers something starts to move in the pool its moves with such amazing speed a mermaid are you serious my face glittered because abesenpai mentioned a mermaid a mermaid is that lovely creature having the upper body of a beautiful girl and the lower body of a fish right if you say mermaid then their beautiful voice is remarkableakenosan also gives me additional information wow im looking forward to this splash a mermaidsama comes out from the pool this is the mermaid estleena what abesenpai introduces to us is a massive fish with legs it has the form of a tuna with legs gyogyogyo gyogyogyo it has a voice which suits its appearance i mean its a fish this is completely a fiiiiiisssh what is this awkward creature im so shocked that my eyes are about to pop out and
abesenpai says it to me straight a mermaid eeeeeeeeeeeeeeh stop dont crush my fantasy any more than this my tears arent stopping since a while ago this is a mermaid seriously you must be joking this is horrible this is like a dream breaker who gets a benefit with a fish with legs theres no way this thing can perform a beautiful song its a fish how rude estleena sing a song for them abesenpai asked the giant fish gyogyogyo gyoso its singing something with a husky voice it only sounds like a cursed song whats a gyoso please stop i feel like stabbing it with a harpoon why just like the time with yukionna this mermaid why must the world hate me rather i kinda knew something like this would happen itseemed like it was going to turning out like this but i thought there was going to be a bit of pity for me my tears arent stopping because of this harsh reality its a cute song asiachans eyes are sparkling it seems like there was something which grasped a hold of asiachan tthis is just horrible i broke down on the spot no matter how i look
at it its a tuna with legs if i catch a thing like this while fishing i would release it right away and pretend i didnt see it its so scary that i would be cursed if i didnt release it after all there therekonekochan comforts me while patting my head uuu konekochan konekochan who is a nekomata looks so cute like this but the mermaid and yukionna are creatures i dont want a reality check like this i became very depressed abesenpai says while drinking black tea calmly well there seem to be mermaids that look like the ones in stories but this is the typical one how is this the typical one no matter how you think about it its a creature which goes beyond our imagination uooooooo i dont want to record in the dictionary inside my brain that this is a mermaid hey the socalled estleenasan is opening her mouth so painfully at the poolside while laying down gyogyo arara this is bad shes dehydrated she would die because she wont be able to breathe when she comes up on land then return her to the sea having her live in the depths of the sea
would make both her and me happy a shadow approaches us which had just returned the fish called estleena to the pool ojousama your father will be arriving very soon the one who appeared is a birdlike monster man with a cockscomb on his head a beak for his mouth and wings on his arms abesenpai nods yes i understand oh i still havent introduced him yet he is my personal bodyguard who is also the sky monster the bird man takahashi he is also the one hyoudoukun will be using takahashi he has a japanese name like that where in japan are there bird men like this takahashi came from kobekobe there are bird men in kobe strange bird men are supposed to be legendary monsters that live on easter island xenovia who is quite knowledgeable about monsters is tilting her neck and is confused so there are bird men on island with a moai oh you must mean the watanabe family my ancestor returned to japan and became takahashi japan and the easter island i dont get which one is the correct answer no i dont care any more it wont be good if i think too hard

aura sshes mad at me werent you supposed to back me up abesenpais dad says without even getting off his horse very well i will test you myself to see whether or not you are fitting to become a groom for the abe family flash weird lighting flashes in the background behind senpais dad then finally the match began the first match is the land monster battle there is a rectangular battlefield created by making lines in the garden the battle begins inside it the one i will be sending first is this one come out the one which appeared isa snow gorilla that is much bigger than christie uoooooo the whole body is covered in scars it seems like a strong one with a historical background the aura coming from its body isnt normal abesenpai that male yeti has amazing intensity can christie defeat it i ask abesenpai but she shook her head eh what does that mean i became doubtful and abesenpai answers me clearly that is christies older sister stephanie yes i thought i had misheard her so i asked again older sister stephanie tthats a female yes a maiden wait its a battle between sisters what
is going to happen the referee will be me kiba yuutokiba is standing at the centre of the field he makes the two snow gorillas come inside the battlefield senpais dad and i stood at the edge of the field and we started the battle by giving orders from there begin the land monster battle began at the same time as kibas call stephanie first do the drumming hokyoooooon don don don the opponent gorilla started to hit her chest after the order senpais dad gave her the yukionnas drumming has the ability to increase its attack power what it has an effect like that thank you for the explanation dad then we will also do the drumming christie uhohohohohoho dododododo ignoring my order christie suddenly started to run across the field what is that girl doing seeing that konekochan mutters that isyukionnas special technique the snowclone snow clone as i looked on in bewilderment christie increased its number to two then three then four and without realising it there are many gorillas on the field so its a self duplicating technique snow cloning man there are only gorillas this is the worst scenery ever did you know that konekochan
konekochan gave an explanation to akenosan who asked her its a high level secret technique which can only be attained by yukionna that live in the japanese alps they say clones can make different movements to that of the original self once mastered there are things like this the world sure is filled with mysteriesngh you are quite good to do the snowcloning while giving the order to do a drumming her dad started to groan you are wrong its just that gorilla started to act on its own going beyond my imagination stephanie we cant lose either counter it with the freezing beattodeath stick whats that scary sounding technique stephanie started to take something out of the bag she has on her back its a banana buuuuuuuu she throws the banana into the air after freezing it with her freezing breath please look everyone these gorillas can do freezingbreath uho christie who has her eyes focused on the banana jumps into the sky together with her clones so it reacted to the banana it cant be helped since its a gorilla wait thats the freezing beattodeath stick its just a frozen banana christie started to jump towards the banana
this is bad her clones also disappeared shes defenceless without any hesitation stephanie tackles christies body dogon ubo christie who received the tackle headon gets thrown outside the field and she lands violently on the ground to attack by using the frozen banana as bait which is the favourite food for yukionna to make its attention go there normal yukionna wouldnt be able to resist and eat the banana on the spot but it used that as an item the opponent yukionna who can overcome its greed towards the banana has been trained very well konekochan explained like a commentator huh was this girl always like that perhaps shes a secret fan of monster battles christie who is on the ground is laying there flat down ah this is overthe winner stephanie so the winner of the first match is abesenpais father the referee kiba declares shit they got one victory i never knew a gorilla battle was so complicated so we have to include a banana among our strategies huh goristie your death wont be in vainperhaps also she isnt dead fufufu absurd i wont be able to permit you dating my daughter at this rate senpais dad showed
a fearless smile can i win against this person i only feel uneasy about it but my fighting spirit also raised since we came this far im definitely going to win the next match will be the sea monster battle so that pool is going to be the stage huh now i shall show all of you my monster while lightning flashes a giant fishtype monster appeared it has the form of a sharka creature with legs uoooooo its a sharkversion of estleena but its filled with a dangerous atmosphere it looks strong by its appearance after all ours looks like a tuna no matter how you think about it the shark is stronger butthe shark shows no sign of movement its just standing there while its mouth is wide open when senpais dad thinks it strange and touches it while mounted on his horsedrop the shark dropped to its side huh this shark isnt responding ah since its a shark it would die if it doesnt continue to swim eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh i was shocked at the stupid reaction of senpais dad kiba approaches it and confirms its status after a while he shook his head and then declaresthe winner of
the second match is isekun i attained a victory which i can not describe i won without doing the match incidentally estleena who was also waiting for us by the poolside died from dehydration without anyone realising it later on there were tuna and shark fins on the dining table well thats a story for another time and finally the last match was about to begin part 4 the final match the sky monster battle we changed the location to a mountain with no sign of people we teleported using the transportation method of devils a magiccircle if its deep in the mountains we can have the monsters fly as much as we want without caring about anyone seeing senpais dad and i are opposing each other on the surface which has bumpy rocks if its this place we can look around the sky and there arent things that will become a hindrance both of us will do the sky battle while riding on top of the monsters alright senpais dad tells me the rule i see hold on senpais dad prepared a large mysterious looking bird gyaaaaaaaon it threatens us with that terrifying sound hiiiiii if we get poked
by that large sharp beak it will leave a big hole in our bodies my partner is takahashisan i was riding on takahashisans back im piggybacking fufufu boy its good weather this wind this feeling on my skin is definitely the one for a battle why do you have such high tension i on other hand want to go home quickly you can say that im like a weather vane right nowi dont like this bird i dont get what he is saying and i want to punch him it pisses me off even more that his feathers feel good senpais dad is already up in the sky with the ominous bird while riding on his horse that is hes riding on the ominous bird while straddling his horse the ominous bird is carrying a giant horse which is also carrying the fistking that looks so abnormal and it has so much intensity does he like to be on top of a horse that much kiba comes between us and shouts final match please begin flap the ominous bird goes up into the sky very quickly its fast this is bad just tackling us with that speed can give us
huge damage we also need to fly up takahashisan we also need to uoooooooooooooo dodododododododo takahashisan started to run on the ground swiftly while ignoring my words eeeeeeeeh what is this bird man doing hehey takahashisan why are you running so speedily you are a bird man arent you you wont be able to do a sky battle if you dont fly fu im a bird man but a nagoyakochin bird man we basically cant fly he tells me very boldly cant flyyyyyy wait nagoyakochin didnt you come from kobe kobe is also a large place after all he ignored the hyogo prefecture what is this birrrrrrrrd his ancestor came from easter island to japan so how did it end up being nagoyakochin made up are the settings of your background all made up also its a fraud that you cant fly even though your name is sky its not a fraud its nagoyakochin i will roast you bird bastaaaaaarrrd you have your guard downwhile the nagoyakochin and i were arguing senpais dad who is on the ominous bird came rushing towards us oh takahashisan dodges swiftly oh even though he cant fly he has good dodging skills you are
doing well but it still isnt enough i saw senpais dad giving some kind of order to the ominous bird then the ominous bird opens its beak wide gooooooon the ominous bird released a huge fireball from its mouth dooooooon dooooon the fireball is falling heading our way if we get hit by that i will actually become a yakitori hahahaha what are you laughing at bird bastard i will also end up being a roasted dragon so run i tell ya run takahashisan started to run while dodging the fireball coming at us this isnt good a bird which cant fly isnt useful huff huff i started to breath hard i will die at this rate i will be killed takahashisan and i somehow dodged the enemys attack and hid behind a large rock when i looked out from behind the rock so we wouldnt be seen i saw senpais dad and the ominous bird who are looking for us its only a matter of time until they find us anyway i need to calm down and think how we should act calmly okay i should make a plan with takahashisan takahashisan was also breathing hard you have to
be calm at times like this there is a saying in my family they say that if you take three steps forward and two steps back you willhave a clearer mind wait what was i doing again where is this place who are you you look like my relative yoshidasan are you yoshidasan did his memory change rather than having a clearer mind they were deleteeeeed a birdbrain also who is yoshida does he look like me do i look like a nagoyakochin geez i also dont get what im saying any more it feels like i will have bad memories about nagoyakochin now its over i held my head down while hiding behind the rock by the way yoshidasan where is this place asked the bird bastard who is looking around the place i cant control this bird at all while i was in a panic a box appears in my line of sight is this perhaps when i open the box timidly gasper was inside hhello oh gasper why are you here yyes i was sent here bbuchou said she wants me to help isesenpai who is in danger i see if its a box then no one
would be suspicious about it actually it will be suspicious after all there is a cross dressing vampire inside the box especially on a mountain in a rocky area like this most likely buchou and the others sent me this useful item using a small magiccircle the special ability of this guy is that he can stop the time of things within his sight not even a big online shopping site sells an ultimate item like him you are really being useful lately just how convenient are you iim not really sure what is going on but i will do my best gasper seems like hes panicking but its not a problemhuh there is something which looks to be a letter attached to the box it has buchous name on it the person i love this is whats written in the letter do your best i believe that you will win to my lovely ise i try to find buchou from this rocky area ah i found buchou and the other club members in a high location i was so deeply moved that i shed tears aaaah as i thought the woman i love sure is the best she trusts
me no matter what realising that once again is enough to make me think that i can win i also thought of a plan there is only this plan takahashisan i called the bird man takahashisan what is it yoshidasan i shall ignore that simple matter for now wave your hands at that ominous bird after leaving this rock i dont really get it but there is no reason for me to decline yoshidasans request heeey oh he went without any second thoughts im sorry takahashisan i will be using you as bait takahashisan is found instantly the bird headed for takahashisan at great speed its here i shouted while lifting up gasper in the box gasper thats your target freeeeeze it yyesssssssss flash a red light comes out from the box and then the ominous bird carrying abesenpais dad stops its movement fallabesenpais dad and the ominous bird fall down below themis takahashisan wait its not frozen in the air even when it was stopped by gaspers power i thought this guys power would stop anything exactly where it is even in midair is it because gaspers power is changing or is it because he couldnt make that man
and the ominous bird remain in the air abesenpais dad and the ominous bird crash down dooooooon takahashisan gets caught up in the crash without doing anything kokeeeeeee the scream of the nagoyakochin echoes throughout the mountain part 5 from the mountain we returned to abesenpais house it is my loss looks like i have to permit your relationship with my daughter i will cancel the engagement senpais dad still seems like he isnt convinced after that the battle was over well it was thanks to buchous planit was because of gaspers help takahashisan who was in a critical condition after crashing with the ominous bird was healed with asias healing power it was fun today i want to meet you again on the battlefield yoshiisan the bird man asks for a handshake hehehe i dont want to see you ever again yeah im sorry our asia cant heal bird brains also wasnt it supposed to be yoshidasan actually thats also wrong my name is hyoudou when i gave my farewell to takahashisan abesenpai appearedhyoudoukun thank you for today thanks to you the engagement was cancelled no im glad i was able to help you it seems like senpai is
acting shyly even if it was a sudden request i was really happy that you fought very seriously for mmy sake huh shes not acting her usual prideful self whats going on you looked a bibit amazing when you fought together with takahashi and the others shes wriggling so much what the she looks quite cute what happened to her i started to become suspicious but the colour of crimson appeared in my sight if its okay with you how about tonight we go for dinn buchou ah i called out buchou while senpai was saying something thats because buchou is right in front of me ah im sorry what was that again i asked her but she smiled after taking a breath looks like there is no chance for me to win after all its nothing huh what was she trying to say i bowed to abesenpai and ran towards buchou buchou i won thanks to buchou buchou smiled i see looks like you accomplished the request safely where is everyone the club members were already goneeveryone went home at once to take the prize received from kiyomesans request items related to different types of monsters which they would
be taking back to the clubroom is that so i should have helped out as well gyuu buchou and i linked our armsnow lets go home together lets buy some taiyaki on the way back so we can eat it with everyone fufufu looks like it will be a date to the taiyaki shop buchou and i were walking home after leaving abesenpais house a date until we get back to our house this is the best uhahaha im so happy i feel the happiest when im like this buchou muttered something while hugging my arm eh did you say something i asked but buchou winked cutely its a secret i dont know why but buchous smile looked amazingly cute that alone made the tiredness i got with this request disappearlife 3 the disturbance of a devil part 1 this happened right after we defeated the evil god from the north loki hello everyone its me hyoudou issei the reason why i have such low and bad tension is because sniff i started to sniff and have a runny nose yeah it seems like my body isnt feeling well this morning i walked towards the dining table weakly after i
somehow managed to brush my teeth man even my legs feel heavy and my head is spinning around inside ara ise morning buchou who woke up before me greets me with a smile aaah buchou looks beautiful today as well my parents and the others who are living with me have gathered at the table looks like im the last one i tried to walk towards the table but suddenly felt that the table was far away huh even my vision is blurry rubbing my eyes isnt helping with the blurriness now staggering forward i began to feel lightheaded and stumble backwards just as i was about to fall someone stops and holds me from behind when i turned around it was xenovia hey ise are you okay your face is red oh xenovia thanks asia approaches me and she puts her hand on my forehead aaah asias palm is cold and it feels so good he has a high temperature hearing asias shocked voice the expression of everyone at the table changed i see so my temperature is high even my consciousness is starting to drift away ise did you perhaps catch the flu buchou also rushes to me
after putting a plate on the table devils can also catch the flu rather do they even catch a flu that a human catches no in this case it is a devils irina and konekochan are chatting quietly after all the things about devils are kept a secret from my parents rossweissesan takes my hand and examines my pulse your pulse is beating fast it might be better to consult a medical institute lets contact the hospital rias you are right akeno i will contact the hospital belonging to the house of gremory right away hohospital one in the underworld hey hey hey ise do you have a cold but he looks bad hello ise dad and mum are also worried about me while everyone calls out my name i lost consciousness i was looking at an unfamiliar ceiling after waking up lying on a bed my arm is connected to an iv drip it appears im in a hospitalinside a room huh i was preparing to go to school while i wasnt feeling well and then went downstairs i remember i went down to the living room and is it me or is my body feeling better is it
thanks to this ivwhile i was having a cloudy recollection the colour of crimson appears in front of me ise you are awake buchou looks into my face she seems relieved isesan im so glad i was shocked when you fell unconscious asia and akenosan are also here asia is red and swollen around her eyes was she crying i made asia worry about me again umm this place is when i asked you fainted at home so you were transported to this hospital do you remember it buchou explained to me i see i was brought to the hospital after fainting the underworld huh yeah i cant go to a hospital in the human world because im a devil so this is my room huh am i in such a serious condition i dont want to diei still havent had sex with buchou i ccant die yet wait since im having those thoughts in this situation maybe my condition isnt so bad that i would be dying i will inform the doctor that he woke up after saying that rossweissesan leaves the room i look around the room by just moving my head konekochan andgasper are sleeping together on
a chair did gasper who doesnt live with us come all the way to the hospital in the underworld for me they must have been waiting for me to wake up and went to sleep after getting tired if that is the case then im sorry konekochan gasper it seems its easy to get a flu if you are a reincarnated devil xenovia you should be careful tooyeah i havent caught a cold that often but i will be careful yes you dont seem to catch a cold that often you are always full of energy and it seems you can endure viruses maybe being a simpleton is a good thing i feel like i was looked down on a lot but that doesnt matter you have to look after your health everyday and that is the cure to everything irina and xenovia are talking while reading a thick book is that book related to medicine uuu am i sick this is a situation where i dont understand what is going on while my head is spinning around and then knock knock someone knocks on the door buchou the doctor is here kiba and rossweissesan enter with a man in
a white coat so kiba also came ive started to think of kiba as my friend now a man a person who seems to be a doctor comes in while bringing a young nurse with him wow so nurses also wear white clothing even in the underworld huh this medical institute is originally a hospital for reincarnated devils who were previously human so the style of those working in the hospital is adjusted to the former humans standard buchou whispers in my ear i see so there are hospitals for reincarnated devils in the underworld well thats obvious in the current devils society there are many reincarnated devils who were previously human maybe reincarnated devils would feel safer if the hospital is made similar to the ones in the human world the nurse took my hand then started to check my pulse and blood pressure looks like even devils are checked in similar ways to humans for these things or is it just limited to reincarnated devils the male doctor looks at me and says well to say it in one word you have a cold though its a type that only devils get you are telling me that it
is a deviltype coldthe doctor continues while i have many doubts about it except you also have a flu that dragons catch and the two viruses have merged showing stronger symptoms since your body base is human having those two viruses occur at once caused your body to become very weak i also have a dragon flu i get a dragon flu because im also the sekiryuutei huh getting two viruses isnt something i can joke about and how is his condition buchou asks the doctor his flu should be lighter due to the iv drip yup my body does feel better than when i was at home i do have antipyretic so lets inject it into him with that his fever will lighten for the time being i will also give you medicine so please rest at home for 2 or 3 days even if your fever disappears please refrain from doing intense exercises and no masturbation im just joking vulgar conversation is forbidden konekochan who suddenly woke up replied to the doctors dirty joke looks like i have to rest for a while including that as well wwell in this condition my sexual desire wont be coming out
i dont even have the energy to stand up after seeing a nurse you know this is quite serious for someone as perverted as me those who are also living in the same house he is need to be injected with a vaccine as well it does get passed onto other devils the doctor gave his instructions to the nurse and she gives an injection to the club members then it was my turn now for you don my eyes were about to pop out after seeing the giant object in front of me its this injection the socalled injection was clearly as big as my body iiinjection no no no matter how you look at it its clearly some kind of weapon isnt it ive only seen something like those in comedy manga you need to be injected with this much vaccine for the dragon flu its okay look the needle is very thin and it will somehow stick in no no no thats impossible ill die if i get injected with something like that its okay you will only feel pain for just a moment aaah the nurse lifts up the injection easily and shes showing me a
fearless smile her gentle voice makes me even more scared instead i will break if i get injected with that much fluid gough gough shit my eyes are getting blurry because of many reasons now well things like this are bound to happen in a story the doctor said something mysterious youre doing this for a reason like that nooooooo ssave me i try to escape from my bed with the last of my strength but endure it you are a boy arent you im sorry isekun endure it ise isnt it better than being stabbed by me my body gets pushed down by buchou kiba and xenovia wait didnt xenovia just threaten me fuu aaan i then get my ear breathed into by akenosan whilst i had my guard down ufufu this is the best way to handle isekuni lost my strength with an erotic attack tthats cheating akenosan looks like you have relaxed now please show me your butt then the nurses eyes shone the club members take my pants off very quickly when i lost my strength then my ass gets exposed in front of everyone no i cant become a groom any more i covered my
face with both my hands as i couldnt endure the embarrassment of the situation im in isesans bottom looks very ccute good job asia and irina gave me weird cheers so my ass is cute on top of doing a good job relax i will personally do something about you becoming a groom when i was about to turn around after hearing buchous words to say are you serious okay here it comes i saw the injection approaching my ass nnooooooooooo poke that day i had a huge injection injected into my ass in front of everyone part 2 that is how i was injected with antipyretic i returned home and am sleeping quietly on my bed alone i also drank the medicine given to me as instructed compared to how i felt before going to the hospital im feeling much better however my body still feels heavyuggh just lifting my body up a bit makes my head spin and going to the toilet takes a lot of effort my sexual desire also isnt increasing well if i was having an ecchi feeling even in a situation like this that would be a problem in its own way cough cough
uggh im still coughing its a bit different from the cold i had when i was a human a devils fever has similar symptoms to a humans fever but there is one critical difference that is we cant use our demonic powers the aura which is the source of demonic power doesnt come out from our body apparently a fever also affects whatever creates our demonic powers and once we get sick that process is stopped i barely have any demonic powers but i can still sense coldness which is one of its traits unlike a humans fever our sixth sense becomes unstable and i am feeling insecure as a result its similar to the uneasiness of being unable to go to the toilet alone after watching a horror film apparently reincarnated devils who suddenly gained demonic power get this feeling when they suddenly lose their demonic powers so i am having this cold scary feeling maybe its because of my sickness but i really want someone with me because i feel very lonely right now apparently the dragon flu causes an inability to breathe fire and the loss of special abilities but since my body is humanbased i dont
suffer those effects only my body feels exhausted oh yeah from today until my fever gets better i have to sleep by myself uggh i usually sleep with buchou and asia so i really feel lonely at these times im missing buchous warmth having buchou embrace me i go to sleep while feeling the sensation of womens soft skin that is really the best aaaah i really am missing buchous oppai while thinking my feelings towards buchougacha the sound of the door being opened when i looked that way ise are you resting properly it was buchou in white clothing buchou in a nurse costumeeeeee shes showing her legs that much ugh gough i got so excited that i coughed i dont know why but my chest was filled after seeing buchou in a nurses costume i think my pulse became faster as well haahaa bubuchou thats the best im in ppain but its making me excited even though my body is getting worse i was shedding tears of gratitude at buchous appearance aaaah like i thought my perverted core still remains even though im sick hhey ise are you okay you look like you are in pain maybe this
costume failed i wanted you to get better even by a bit so we decided to do this together buchou approaches me in her nurse costume and extends her hand towards my cheek aaaah maybe i dont mind dying today isesan are you okay asias voice when i looked that way there was my eyes were glued to the goddess in white clothing ddid something happen asia has a question mark above her head while tilting her head for the innocent asia to wear a nurses costume which is a symbol of purity i was gazing at her with fascination because there isnt any combination that surpasses this combo existing in this world asia in a nurses outfit its not something which merely fits her she is one of those types of girls who heals your heart she has the ability to healasia who has all those criteria is wearing a nurses outfit of course it will suit her its not something you can express but it simply suits her i started feeling as if a goddess truly exists now im going to keep this image of her along with the current buchou within the photo album inside me this
is the best guha bubuchou and asiait suits you both its the best you havent failed at all just seeing this makes me happy that i am alive i gave them a forced smile while pressing on my chest and gave them my gratitude i even started to get a nosebleed i dont know whether i got this nosebleed because i got excited or because of my sickness but i understand this is a serious condition for me right now i smiled at both of them while shedding tears ise hey we only came to bring water and soup isesan please dont die both of them hold my hand i am being watched over by two beauties in nurse outfits i cant ask for more i leave my pornomags to you seriouslyplease dispose of themand my dvdsyou cant keep them as a memento of me okay what are you saying here at least drink some water ueeeen isesan is asia dont cry you know this boy wont die from something like this right i took some water and went to sleep after having some broth the next time i opened my eyes it was already night around this time the
job of a devil should be over i ended up taking a day off even though im like this i have customers as well you know today buchou and asia arent in my bedroom as i thought its lonelyhuh i feel some weight on me its not from the fever there is clearly something on my body when i touched it i felt something very soft when i lookedthere was konekochan in a white costume while having cat ears and a tail suusuu shes asleep and her breathing is gentle hmm actually my body is feeling warm perhaps she was using senjutsu to make my ki flow better for quite some time as well konekochan she must have healed my body on top of finishing her job as a devil this girl really cares about her comrades huh even though she is usually a sharp tongued loli girl i pat konekochans head nya please getbetter quickly konekochan says in her sleep sob my tears are flowing because of konekochan who cares deeply for her senior where did i catch my cold from im not xenovia but was it because i didnt pay enough attention to my health maybe there was
a source where i caught my flu while i was muttering we think that it may be the virus which the salesman who came to do some trading with rias had you know how we sometimes call salesmen into the basement and do some shopping aaah you sure do those kinds of things sometimes wait akenosan was there and appeared to agree with my suspicion in a small voice she was sitting on the chair next to the bed without me realising itas i thought she is also wearing a nurses costume on her legs she is wearing fishnet stockings which are exposed under her small skirt ooooooo nurse costume and fishnet stockings thats the best combination there is she has her legs crossed akenosan please cross your legs again your thighs are so bright akenosan your erotic gesture is very bad for my body right now but thank you there isnt any better pain than this huh ugh actually my pulse is racing ara ara are you okay konekochan and i are in charge of you from midnight you know so i will be giving you service until morning sservice im able to receive services from akenosan in a
nurses outfit aaah if i was healthy at times like this then i could probably have made a naughty request no probably because i am sick i was able to see everyone in nurse outfits akenosans face gets closer my heart is beating faster akenosan whispers in my ear i will wipe your face now saying that akenosan raised the level of my pillow and then she raised my head she starts to wipe my face with a wet towel the wet towel feels good but my eyes were glued to the phenomenon occurring right in front of me every time akenosan who is bending forward wipes my faceher oppai are jiggling right in front of my eyeeees how is it akenosan asks me if she wiped my face correctly but im not concerned about that right nowim more focused on the breasts which are bouncing right in front of me yyes to the rright and the leftright left so you want me to wipe your cheeks more then ara ara you started to bleed from your nose akenosan even wiped my nosebleed i sure had my eyes filled now im shedding tears of gratitude at the oppai which are
bouncing in every direction maybe becoming sick is the best thing ever thats what i thought akenosan made a sensual smile and then says to me after isekun gets better maybe playing doctor would be a good thing ddoctor you say yes like this i dont know where she got it from but akenosan took out a stethoscope she then puts the stethoscope to her oppaaaaaai bu seeing the stethoscope stick to her oppai my nosebleed spurted out very strongly a situation where i get examined by doctor ise my brain was destroyed with her lustful voice that is one of those scenes which comes up in a naughty dvd then i started to imagine a scenario in my mind oh himejimasan is there something wrong with you todaydoctor my chest hurts so much i definitely must have come down with a very bad disease now dont say that lets check you out using my stethoscope oppai show me your breasts yyes please do hmm now is it over here ann tthat isnt the place geez doctor hahahaha im sorry about that i cant i started to breathe harder even if i imagine an erotic situation i should be resting
but why am i feeling more pain just by imagining such classic erotic things thats because of the way akenosan is acting of course it would turn out like this akeno what are you doing the sudden voice of buchou when i looked buchou had come in without me realising she was there she looks really mad sscary shes even covered in aura ara rias you came rather than that you have become very good at entering a room without making your presence felt lately of course if i didnt attain a skill like this i have a feeling that ise wouldve been eaten by you i dont know the reason behind it but you also learned a technique which allows you not to be caught by konekos senjutsu technique of searching right oh my you say it as if im some kind of beast so rude its a simple thing for a maiden in love to make the impossible possible but eating isekun deliciously would definitely be dreamy both of them glare at each other with intensity i feel a different kind of coldness piercing through my skin i really think the atmosphere in this room is the worst
type there is its bad for my bbodykoneko is sleeping and the condition of ises body is important lets head to the rooftop then yes deciding who is the better nurse tonight might be a good thing both of them sparking with hostility against each other left the room a bit later i heard noises of lightning and something loud from the windowso i acted as if i didnt hear anything i sighed at the usual battle between the oneesama then there was someone else who entered the room it was the silver haired nurse rossweissesan so you woke up did you receive your medicine from riassan and akenosan i shook my head at her question confirming that it seems like rossweissesan felt down rather than that you also came wearing a nurses outfit so faithfully huh rossweissesan im quite moved thats what i thought when i went past them in the corridor they were releasing very strong auras so i thought it might have turned out like this saying that she approaches me takes medicine from a bag and gives it to me along with a cup of water taking the medicine with an empty stomach isnt recommended so
here you go rossweissesan hands me several small pieces of solid food which look like biscuits its a valhallan nutrientrich food you can eat it simply and also get all the necessary nutrients with only this small portion normally it would be better to take proper food but this will be the better for you right now tthank you very much i said my thanks and then put the biscuit into my mouth ah it isnt that hard its quite soft and also sweet i think it will be easy to eat since i added a little bit of sugar you did all this for mei asked and rossweissesan replies with a unpleasant face everyone seems depressed if you dont recover the teams mood maker should get better immediately she says that to me strictly but her cheeks are a bit red so rossweissesan is also worried about me i really need to recover quickly i dont know how much of a mood maker i am but for my comrades i cant stay like this any longer senpaiplease get better i felt like i would heal with the words from konekochan who is sleeping right next to me part 3
when i woke up in the morning i didnt see konekochan she must have woken up before me yup within just a night i feel much better than when i was carried to the hospital i feel i can go to the toilet on my own now without a problem my feverhas gone down quite a bit well they say that the most crucial time is when your fever is recovering the most so i cant let my guard down yet when i was thinking of taking a nap my room was entered oh ise youre awake yahoo isekun we brought your meal the ones who entered werexenovia and irina in nurse outfits so the girls in our home are actually going to nurse me wearing a nurses outfit huh does it suit me xenovia asks me while giving me a peace sign yeah both you and irina look goodboth of them did a high five after hearing my reply the two of you sure have high tension this morning though in exchange for being happy at seeing them in nurse outfits it feels like my fever will worsen from being excited but since i want to save them wearing
nurse outfits in my memory i must see them wearing nurse outfits even if i have to force myself especially irina who is a reincarnated angel is actually an angel in white nurses clothing a real angel being a nurse sure is good i took a single deep breath xenovia and irina brought a tray and put it on the stand which is next to my bed there is an ominouscoloured soup and juice with the same colour ddont tell me these two made this when i looked at them timidly both of them were looking at me with keen eyes irina and i checked up on medicinal plants that are said to be good for the body we gathered as much as we could it has perfect marks for nutrients its a soup and juice that will make you recover immediately what a bright smile they must have made it with great effort but i havent seen either of you cooking before you know i only feel uneasy about thiiiiiss rather this soup something unknown is appearing in the soup is this a leg and it seems like there is an eyeball as well you must be joking those
arent medicinal plants this is something you are not allowed to see if this is a television programme they would definitely be censoring this i also wonder what kind of ingredients you need to make juice like this with bursting noises both of them definitely have ingredients that arent medicinal plants both of them are looking at me worriedlyas i thought my cooking isnt so i cant even do a single household chore after all im so worthless this makes me a failure as an angel michaelsama please give divine punishment to me it feels like that is whats going through their minds okay okay then i just have to drink it right i can not decline it and betray their expectations i made up my mind and put the spoon in the soup shuuuuu hhey the moment i put the spoon in a mysterious gas was coming out from the soup ugh what is this its getting in my eyes my tears wont stop this is a hazardous substance this definitely isnt something with perfect marks for nutrients i swallowed and was just about to lift up the spoon iisesenpai the one who entered was gasper in a nurses
outfit even you wear nurse outfits at times like this wwell it does suit you wwhats wrong when i asked gasper answers with a frightened voice a gggguest is hereeee senpais friend came here to see how you are doing after finding out you got a cold what came to see me my friend who is it is it my evil buddies matsuda and motohama or is it saji i started to imagine my friends in my head but dropped the spoon on the floor when i saw the being which entered while saying nyo devilsan i came to see you nyothick arms thick chest there was a large man in a nurses outfit with an unbelievable amount of muscle miltan yes heshe is my regular customer from my job as a devil and her name is miltan a girl born from a man with overwhelming muscles who desires to become a mahou shoujo rip rip rip look look look look miltans nurse outfit which isnt fitting her size is screaming because of being pushed back by her muscles gasper led miltan in and then ran to the corner of the room saying i dont want to die i dont
want to die while his body is trembling xenovia and irina are shocked at the entrance of miltan who is this guy i feel unbelievable pressure coming from him i can tell that he is a famous warrior no when i was at the vatican i think i saw a similar warrior when there was a plan to fight a certain vampire tribe he has an atmosphere i havent seen in the database in heaven as well he seems like he is a nurse who has been through many battles ummm hes a humanright both of them looked serious you two are thinking too much about her hes just a hentaiin other words a girl born from a man you can say that he is the same type as gasper who is also a girl born from a manbut gasper himself has lost his will to fight after being taken out by miltans haki seeing me miltan starts to shed many tears devilsan certainly must have fallen sick because miltan was calling you every night nyo somehow he seemed to have a misunderstanding miltan even though he looks like that he has the heart of a maiden so its difficult
if he gets a misunderstandinghe seems to be shaking but his muscles appear to be tensing can you please stop look even xenovia and irina got into their battle stances after sensing danger mmiltan im okay its just a fever i will get better if i rest a bit after that lets watch some milky dvds once again and devilsan all the furniture in my room shook at the voice released by miltan and an unknown pressure pressed against me as well when miltan put her hand in her bag i made a magical drink using the data collection from milky nyo he gives me a bottle inside it is an ominous coloured liquid i started to feel my consciousness going far away it would have been better if i just lost my consciousness right now from morning i drank poisonsi drank large amounts of drinks that have medicinal plants in them part 4 i who have drunk outrageous things since morning am laying down on the bed after that i expelled many things from inside me in the toilet were there really any medicinal plants inside them the soup and juice made by xenovia and irina then on top
of that a special drink made by miltan i want to praise myself for surviving after drinking those anyway i didnt want to eat anything for lunch after drinking something like that my stomach cant take anything i was killing time watching tv by myself i took a break from school today im listed as being on sick leave checking on my condition it was decided that i will take a break for three daysit seems like the other devils at school the sitri group were injected with a vaccine i did go to school before falling ill after all being cautious about it isnt a bad thing so everyone is at school huh oh yeah i received an email from the two idiots youre telling me an idiot can also get sick no maybe you can fall ill if you are a big pervert you arent possibly having a video marathon by watching the treasured dvds you have are you also return the dvd the legend of the secret bath discovery iv welcome to the spa for the bigbreasted i let you borrow before yeah they sure are rude guys when i recover im gon na punch matsuda and
motohama also i wont give that dvd back to you yet motohama when i looked at my wrist watch it was already time for club right about now they should be eating snacks while having a laugh so no devils job for me today as well huh since i have been working the whole time moving my body its been a while since i rested like this something like this isnt bad at times however i feel lonely so i would rather stay with everyone instead i should get better as soon as i can as i thought that there was a knock on the door yes when i respond only one person entered the room a single bishoujo enters my room her hair is long and her body is slim though she has some curves she is a girl who looks to be about the same age as me and who looks pure the mole under her eye left an impression on me most of all she was also wearing a nurses outfitim familiar with this person it became a hot topic in the clubroom when azazelsensei created an item not so long ago are you kiba the bishoujo
nods shyly at my question and says yes yeah the genderchanging ray gun that sensei created as a joke if you get hit by that ray your gender changes if you are a guy then you get changed into a girl if you are a girl you get changed into a guy its possible to transform for a bit the clubroom became a disaster when buchou and the other girls changed into handsome guys back then i used the ray on kiba as a joke and made him into a girl i was really shocked when kiba turned into the type of girl i like by the way gasper was also hit by the ray and his appearance didnt change it seemed like he lost something important as a guy i pinched my cheek thinking this is a dream butouch it isnt a dream i pointed my finger at him while my heart is racing yyou why did you return to that form again more than that why are you here why am iii getting confused this much of course i would become confused if this guy enters my room while being a bishoujo in a nurse outfit why is
this guy here at a time like this it should still be time for the club kiba says while wriggling the story about wearing a nurses outfit was becoming popular in the club then sensei called me all of a sudden and how about you also meet ise in a nurses outfit he was really interested in you when you became a girl so maybe he would be happy perhaps to cheer him up how about you do this as his friend is what he said to himwhat did he do damn sensei wwell certainly this guy looks cute when he turns into a girl since he originally was a handsome guy of course he will turn into a bishoujo and he sent him like this on purpose im happy but i feel this wasnt needed but i also feel kiba being a bishoujo isnt a bad thing and i was filled with complicated feelings and kiba asks me with a red face ddo i look good in it the nurses outfit certainly does look good on her i could say that with my mouth and tell her but it feels like i would lose if i actually do that
it really feels like i would lose if i admit it i should act since my heart is beating fast because of my flu lets do that if i dont it feels like something important inside me will break ugh somehow im feeling dizzy i urge kiba to sit on the chair next to the bed take a seat first of all tell me if anything changed at school today you will also tell me what you guys talked about at the club as well right when i asked him roughly he responds to me happily by looking at me and saying yeah so this guy was also worried about me in his own way huh well he is my friend after all when i was thinking about the friendship between us ah because of wearing heels he isnt used to wearing he trips on his legs and falls this waykiba falls onto my chest where i had my upper body up hhey are you okay when i looked into his face the face of a bishoujo is right in front of me we stare at each other for a while uumm kiba gazes elsewhere and he seems to be
enduring something while putting on a red face hmm i was in wonder but i feel a soft sensation in my hands when i lookedmy hands are touching kibas breaaaaassssts ah sorry i said sorry and moved my hands the sensation of the oppai in my hands there was no doubt that it was the same as that of a girl kibas oppai was soft no no no no i shook my head hard and rejected what was in my mind just now hes a guy hes a girl right now but hes usually a guy and hes my comrade who is also my friend shit why is my heart beating this fast kiba whose face is red was holding his chest why are you reacting like that can you please laugh it off with your usual handsome face by saying oh my looks like i had my breast groped does that ray also make the persons heart into that of a maiden please stop at this rate i will also start to develop a thing for those kind of things as weeeeeeell im already in pain with my fever so please dont make me have a new turning point
in my life hereisekun i when kiba was about to say something with soggy eyes ise we came back early because we were worried about you buchou and others have come home so we will make something good for your body drop when buchou saw the situation in my room she drops her school bag silently while smiling riasoneesama whats wrong asia pops her head out from behind buchou with a puzzled expression she then sees me on the bed and kiba hauuu isesan andkibasan asia trembles while the lights in her eyes are turning on and off after that each of the girls become astonished at the situation in my room after a pause they shout at once what is the meaning of this i am cornered by the girls but i tell them while protecting kiba who is panicking umm this is i never thought isekun and yuutokun would develop a relationship like this without noticing it akenosan has a complicated expression no that definitely isnt the case here ii came here by my own decision kiba also says came here by his own decision so their relationship has progressed that far alreadykonekochan is thinking too far ahead
kibasan is a manand im a woman yet asia eyes are full of tears holding her shoulder xenovia tells her asia ise might be trying to master a path we cant possibly come to understand you are right i think they call this the dual blade aaaah this is so corruptive and heretical irina was nodding her head a couple of times no dont confirm it ii should also become a girl to do things with senpai please dont gasper please dont show me any more wrong ideas than this rossweissesan hasnt returned yet because shes a teacherbut this situation is very hard to endure ah my heartbeat is getting fast and i started to get dizzy did i perhaps get worse even so i continued to give my excuses at this rate i would end up living with them while they have the wrong idea absolutely not thaaaaaaat aas i was saying kiba and i arent in that sort of relationship and rather kiba was the one who was concerned about my well being and cough cough oh yeah today i only took in those poison like things so i dont have any stamina i think im getting hungry
as well i also expelled all the things i took in this morning so there is nothing inside my stomach i understand that azazel is the cause of all this but it is also yuutos fault you should have told us if this was the case i wouldnt have said no you know buchous gentle words im deeply sorry i was wondering if i could do something for the sick isekunkiba was also reflecting on his action this isnt kibas fault huh my mind started to go far off either way we need ise to recover or everyone wont act like they usually do geez you really are a popular my consciousness disappeared as buchou spoke part 5 when hes feeling ill this is the best thing for ise a miso soup with crushed ginger inside i was drinking the miso soup mum brought to my room aaaah its spreading around to every part of my body yeah this is the thing since i was a kid mum always made this when i fell ill i dont know how much of the devil flu it will cure but after having my body and heart warmed my body feels lighter a
mysterious feeling of security i think i wouldnt feel like this if it wasnt mums miso soup the taste of a mother i felt my heart was healed with it mum i really thank you after that it seems like i lost consciousness for a bit i regained consciousness right away but i was in a weak condition due to an empty stomach then mum appeared and brought this miso soup everyone was looking at me seriously okaasama please teach me how to make that buchou approaches mum with a serious expression mum was in confusion with her eyes opened wide even if you ask me how i made it its really simple you know wwell i did alter it to my style a bit tthat is it okaasan please teach me the taste of the hyoudou residence for my future i have to learn it this time its asia of course i will be learning it as wellyes please teach me the hidden taste of the hyoudou residence as well also akenosan and konekochan even i dont know the socalled taste is there even such a thing in this hyoudou family so this will also be part of bridal
training i see im good at cutting yes xenovia should learn a bit of cooking obasama will you also teach me as well please even xenovia and irina yeah xenovia should learn something a bit girlish then we should learn it as well gasperkun yes i will learn it and make cooking filled with love for isesenpai kiba gasper whats the point of you guys trying to raise my opinions of you ara ara seems like it turned into a serious situation anyway shall we learn this miso soup first yes mum went downstairs while taking buchou and others with her leaving me behind the cooking lesson of the hyoudou residence began this time it feels like there will be the same number of miso soups as the number of them making it that will be very hard for me after a bit from the first floor bon dokan gooon i heard explosive sounds which shouldnt be heard in a kitchen along with kyaa and waaah like screams can something like this happen just by making a soup dont tell me this is the hidden taste of the hyoudou family dinner time there were different types of miso soup on
the table from tasty looking ones made by buchou akenosan and asia to those with anevil presence coming out made by xenovia irina and gasper there are many varieties of them mum so you really taught them how to make the miso soup rather than a secret taste it has colour and smells which shouldnt be passed on what kind of miso do you have to use for it to turn out like this there is too much freedom in the food of our family even if i drink a tasty miso soup it would be a negative thing for my stomach thanks to the dark miso soup please dig in everyone says with a smile yeah im a fortunate guy everyone is worried about me after all but if it continues like this until i get better it feels like my body wont last for real so i had no other choice but to drink the miso soup thinking heal quickly heal quickly inside my head later that day the genderswap raygun was sealed well having that will be a source of trouble so its a natural thing however i think that changing the enemy that come to attack
me into girls using the raygun might be a good thinglife 4 the unressurected phoenix part 1 it is autumn and a rare visitor has come to my house on a day off hhow do you do a pretty girl with drilllike roll hair on both sides of her head came to visit my house i was surprised at the arrival of this visitor whilst dealing with her at the entrance buchou who is beside me is also surprised how do you do ravel did something happen for you to come to this house yes riassama im very sorry for the sudden visit yes this girl who just greeted buchou is ravel phoenix a highclass devil and a daughter from the house of phoenix i see her at times when i go to the underworld but i never thought i would meet her in the human world especially not at my house judging from buchous attitude it appears she didnt receive any notification of this visit beforehand it really is an unexpected visit ravel was wearing a cutelooking onepiece dress after she wiggled her body shyly she spoke as if she had made up her mind the truth is i
would like to consult you about my brother when buchou and i heard that we looked at each other this could be a bit complicated the scene changes to the living room it would be weird to talk to her at the entrance the discussion might become a bit complicated after all akenosan gave tea to ravel about raiser when buchou asks ravel nodsyes im sure you have heard that my brother fell into depression after that incident during the first semester we got involved in the matter of buchous engagement due to the arranged marriage decided by their parents buchou and ravels brother raiser phoenix were fiancs buchou who wanted to marry because of love and not some arrangement decided to break off their relationship by competing against raiser in a rating game a lot happened and the marriage proposal was revoked so buchous engagement is no more that story became quite a topic among the upper echelons of society in the underworld and it left quite a complicated impression on them since the important thing between the highclass devils which has been passed on for generations was involved it became a scandal for the pure devils who take
importance in their traditions i was greatly involved in that incident after all i was the one who bashed up raiser and took buchou from the engagement party regarding that i dont regret my actions since buchou who i like very much didnt want that i risked my life to stop it even now i feel proud for having rescued buchoubut to the house of phoenix i might be their sworn enemy i need to accept that fact a weird tension rises between buchou and ravel the revocation of the engagement has already been settled by their parents who are the current heads they should be able to talk normally however the discussion is complicated as its about raiser who i beat up raiser and his family the house of phoenix have the regeneration ability of the phoenix an immortal bird i used the power sleeping within methe power of sekiryuutei to defeat him after that raiser became seriously depressed for losing to me and for losing buchou even six months after the incident that hasnt changed along with tasting the first defeat in his whole life women also left him for a guy there might not be anything more
depressing than this i was watching over their conversation with asia and the others from the corner of the roomraiser huh i have heard stories about him what kind of person is he xenovia and irina never met him after all umm hes from the house of phoenix and asia started explaining to the two of them oh yeah that incident happened almost immediately after asia joined us the world of highclass devils sure is complicated but i look up to the society of the nobles i wonder if i can find a rich man rossweissesan is up to something the little sister came all the way to visit the house belonging to the gremory maybe they really are having troubles with it you are right konekochan maybe it really is like that i dont know how things got this way but ravel came here after many things happened huh ravel is hiding her usual tsuntsun attitude towards me when i first met her not only was she a tsuntsun but she was a richgirl with an uptight attitude but today shes quiet buchou speaks to break this silent atmosphere so raiserhasnt recovered since then ravel nods at buchous words
it wouldnt have been unusual for ravel to say its your fault in terms of the position we are in but it doesnt seem like she is going to say that well thats something i have been thinking every time i met her in the underworld but it seems like ravel doesnt blame us for it instead she even told me that its a good lesson for her brother raiser even though she said that its an obvious thing to worry about your family ravel then says after drinking her tea naturally it might be wrong for me to come here but when i asked for opinions in different places there were suggestions that i shouldconsult with riassama even treatments that have been tried didnt give any results with me what do you mean ravel clearly answers buchous question to fix my brothers heartmy brothers mentality i received suggestions that maybe its better to learn the thing called guts that the servants of riassama have all of us and buchou made a dumb face for a moment when we heard the answer guts but soon there were a couple of laughs in the living room hahahaguts huh certainly everyone in
our group including me all have guts wait why is everyone looking at me yeah yeah i just move ahead with only guts under this lightened atmosphere ravel spits out all the things she kept within herself the fact is my brother is pathetic for him to stay depressed for six months after a single defeat it seems like hes afraid of dragons you know he hasnt participated in a rating game since then and hes been written about in a gossip magazine where they wrote things however they wanted he has trauma after being defeated by isesama and he doesnt talk about anything related to dragons i would understand if he holds a grudge instead but hes scared you know if hes a man he should learn from his defeat and move on hes really pathetic just pathetic everyone opened their eyes wide at her super machinegun talk she has so much stress huh so is that guy raiser in such a bad state though hes still my brother so deep in her heart shes actually very worried about him buchou who is being consulted must feel quite complicated the first thing is she wont be able to decline
it and ravel didnt come to push the responsibility on us she came purely because she is worried about her brotheryeah as i thought thats the only way i decided to say what was on my mind leave it to me ravel i will do something about it ravel and everyone else looked at me i continued while scratching my cheek wwell its something that i did so i think i have to fix it as well and you want guts right leave it to me if you say guts then im your man even though im a devil i do things like living in the mountains and ive been through a lot of harsh things im used to those kinds of things hes an embodiment of guts both in a good and bad way thats exactly right konekochan ise this is my it sounded like buchou was going to say i will do it so i stopped her with my hand its okay i have a plan its not a bluff i actually do have an idea there was something which crossed my mind that can put guts inside him and also train both his body and soul hahaha
since ive just been training my mind has adapted to think like that not having any talents can be useful at times when i looked at ravel she had a very bright expression but she coughed after she realised it iiit cant be helped then i dont mind asking isesama so please work hard for the highclass devils ii will give my thanks in advance yeah yeah ill do my best then buchou took a breath then nodded her head i understand we will start the strategy to make raiser stand up again by having ise act as his therapist hence it was decided that we will fix that yakitoribastard part 2haaaits huuuuuuuuuge i was overwhelmed by the big castle which stands right in front of my eyes right now we the gremory group irina have come to visit the residence of the house of phoenix when we transferred to gremory territory from the human world we arrived here through a magic circle by doing many jumps the castle is huge buchous house is also big but there is no comparison i heard that they made lots of profit from the healing items phoenix tears and judging from this they
sure have been making lots of money the castles gate opens while making a heavy sound and all of us went inside after we went past the garden of the castle we arrived at the residential area where the people from the house of phoenix live in front of a gorgeous looking door ravel who is wearing a dress and several servants were waiting for us how do you do welcome to the house of phoenix how do you do ravel if i remember raiser lives here right buchou asked her i see it appears buchou came here when she was a child so shes familiar with the inside of the castle yes we can go straight to his room from here with ravels guidance we proceed inside passing through the door oh the ceiling is so high up and the chandelier looks amazing there are expensive looking statutes and paintings everywhere it sure doesnt lose to buchous house if this isnt riassama it has been a very long time and its been a while since we last met sekiryuutei a new voice when i looked a person i am familiar with was standing in front of some stairs its
the woman who has a half mask on her face isabelasan shes raisers servantits been a while isabelasan i have heard many rumours even if i fight again seriously i wont be able to win didnt she say the same thing before this person is the only one among raisers servants who has a good impression of me my master is over here please follow me we followed isabelasan up the stairs and progressed through the spacious building so what does raisersan usually do i ask while we are walking isabelasan answers while making a sigh he hides himself in his room and he either does a virtual rating game or he calls some commoners who are good at chess all the way here so he can have a chess match against them so hes a hikikomori for that show off goodlooking guy to become a hikikomori i really cant imagine it we walked for ten minutes its huge its too huge i also thought the same thing at buchous house but the houses of highclass devils are too huge and the number of rooms is insane i dont even have the slightest confidence that i can find my way
back once i get lost in here while i was thinking that isabelasan and ravel stop in front of a door its a huge door a splendid looking relief of a fire bird is engraved on it knock knock ravel knocks on the door oniisama i have some guests for you no response is he sleeping after thinking that i heard a voice from inside so its you ravel i dont want to meet anyone today i saw a bad dream im not in the mood to meet anyonehearing that ravel made a sigh then she tells him its riassama after a pause gashaaaan the sound of something being dropped on the floor echoes within his room ririasyou say he was really panicked it must have been an unexpected guest for him buchou stood in front of the door and speaks to him raiser its me what do you want with me now rias did you come to laugh at me or did you come to tell me about your intimate relationship with the sekiryuutei the tone of his voice is low rather it sounds like he holds a grudge lets talk for a bit let me see your face
after buchou said that we heard rough footsteps approaching this way and the door was opened violently the one who came out was raiser who had messy hair and untidy clothes what do you want to talk about with the guy who you rejected he had glassy eyes and there was anger within his speech but his expression changes when he sees me se se se sekiryuuteeeei he points at me and shrieks hhey hello i smiled and greeted him by putting my hand up hi hii hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiraiser screamed and ran into his room are you serious whats going on he then shouted after he ran into his expensive bed that has a canopy pplease leeeeeeeave i dont want to remember about back then i dont want it any more i dont want to experience a shabby feeling like that ever again everyone was obviously shocked but also confused by raisers attitude tthis is that guy who looked down on me with his high and mighty attitude got scared the moment he saw me and he hid himself inside the bed raisersama its alright raisers servants the twins with the chainsaws were calming raiser down but raiser just shook timidly
inside his bed raiser hasnt lost in a proper fight since he was born buchou explains ravel also nods yes it seems like losing to isesama head on left a deep scar in both his body and soul but raisersan was also strong if its nowi wonder which one of us is stronger kiba answers my question if its the current isekun then you will be comparable to mr raiser phoenix even at his full power no most likely you can beat him in terms of spiritthe guts you have is superior to him the pressure of taking on a heavenly dragon will drain their spirit and it will also hinder the traits of the immortal bird being immortal is the biggest factor for the power of the phoenix so having that hindered will give a big blow to himho if this guy says that then it must be true in regards to battle kiba calculates calmly after all is it that scary to fight me i ask kiba once again pointing at myself kiba nodded his head while making a bitter smile its scary enough with you being a legendary dragon but also we never know what you might
do is that so wwell even im also scared of the unknown factor which will cause something to happen as well but taking on an immortal is also scary its scary to see someone who will regenerate again once you beat them downoniisama since riassama and her group came all the way here please get out of the bed ravel works hard to take the blankets off him and make him leave his bed ggo home please go hooooooome is all raiser shouted umm to begin with lets take raisersan outside by force after that we cooperated with raisers servants and succeeded in pulling raiser out of his room by force and into the garden of the castle though it took some time to do that i pack my things in the garden alright with this im all set so what kind of plan is it to buchous question i pointed at the sky he will be here soon when i called him before he said he will be here immediately then a big shadow comes flying from far away ah here he is there is a giant shadow above us zuuuuuuuuuuun the giant dragon landed in the garden while
causing the ground to shake violently it hasnt been that long since we last met all of you the giant dragon isthe former dragonking tannin old man thanks for coming i gave my thanks and raiser screams ta ta ta ttttttttannin ultimateclass devil llegendary dragonah so he cant even see a dragon huh hes really scared huh well the old man is a dragon after all the old mans giant eyes grasps sight of raiser raiser phoenix huh ive seen a couple of your rating game matches i had my attention on you as a potential king in future games but judging from how you are right now it seems like you have some problems i gave a simple explanation to the old man even the old man just said pathetic do you think you can do to him what you did with me his family is saying they want him to get some guts the old man made a big smile at my words i see guts huh that sounds good are you saying you want to go to the mountains then yeah i think that would be good i have already packed my stuff and his you are
well prepared rather this is the only thing that came to mind so thats how it is buchou im taking this person with me and im going to the mountains with the old man to train this is my plan i will put aside all the simple stuff i think we can train him by forcing him to go to the mountains and change his environment i was also taken to the mountains by force during summer and was trained quite a lot uuu im getting a flashback of those harsh memories mountains are good yeah it will somehow succeed its like a fantasy for a dragon and phoenix to train in the mountains xenovia and irina were saying such things no this is actually quite bothersome you know but this is all for buchou and ravel so i will take this guy to the mountain with me nnooooooooooooo raiser spreads his wings of fire and tries to escape butgrab the old man quickly catches raiser with a huge hand dont run if you are a man then prepare yourself hiiiiiiiiiii if you look from the sides he looks like a bird that is about to be eaten by a
dragon buchou asia im off then i got on the old mans back quickly and gave my goodbyes to buchou and asia buchou then asks me while looking up at me ise can i really leave this to you of course please call me when you are in trouble yes buchou please dont push yourself okay asia i will also go with you when i gave my farewells to my comrades ravel steps forward and declares with determination that she would be going too what she wants to come with me but i feel bad taking a girl to the mountains with me i was confused and ravel tells me my brotheri want to fix him together with you she has determined eyes she must be really worried about her brother she has good eyes hyoudou issei it wont be a problem if you protect her the old man said with a lively smilesure okay then lets go together ravel ravels response to my words is lively and she happily says yes then used her demonicpowers to change her clothes into something she can easily move in she dressed like an adventurer and was wearing a safari jacket ise take
care of ravel as well yes buchou on the other hand her brother was nno why do i have to go to the mountain raiser was going crazy within the old mans hand for you to show such a pathetic attitude when your sister just showed such courage this is all for you discard your richboy attitude and lets go to the mountain both your body and soul will be cleansed when you inhale some fresh air he glared at me rather than looking at me with fear that seems more like him my servants save me this is an order raiser demands help from his girls who are below him raisersama please endure it go for it they were just cheering him while waving their hands seeing that raiser became so shocked that his eyes were about to pop out yyou girls you are all heartleeeeeeess flap finally the old man flies away from the garden ravel held onto me tightly heeeeeeeelp when i saw raiser i thought it was dj vu of me back in summer yeah being taken away by a dragon sure is scaryazazelsensei thought of this plan first as i thought you are cruel hyoudou
issei if we are going to the mountains then there is a good place how about we go there the old man gives me a suggestion hmm where is that where are we going when i asked the old man answers with a bit of a happy voice my territory part 3 wow amazing i was astonished at the scene in front of me there are many monsters like dragons in front of me the place the old man took me ravel and raiser was his territory where there are many huge dragons there were big holes on various parts of the cliffs of a canyon and there were dragons which exceeded 10 metres popping their heads out of them many dragons were spreading their wings and flying within the valley it appears many dragons are living within this valley raiser ravel and i were dropped on a section of cliff where it was just possible for a person to stand the spacious canyon is right in front of my eyes for someone like me who cant fly by myself it would be dangerous if i fell from here the dragons look at us from their nest holes as if
they find us rare amazing it feels like there are so many monsters here i did hear that dragons also live in the underworld but its my first time seeing their habitat this is the nest of the dragons where my people live this area is only a section of our habitat but you can say this is the borderline that humanoid devils like you guys will just be able to survive also these dragon tribes are the ones which are able to communicate with others the old man explainsdddragons raiser who is next to me has a blue face after seeing the herds of dragons in front of him the traumatic experience he had must really have been great huh tanninsama along with the voice i never heard before two dragons appear in front of us did you summon us a bluescaled dragon and light bluescaled dragon appear in front of us yes hyoudou issei these two are highlevel dragons that serve under me im thinking of leaving raiser phoenix to these two saying that the old man explains the situation to the two dragons roger that its seriously okay both of them replied immediately it seems like the
bluescaled dragon replied quite light heartedly though raiser phoenix the old man said a single sentence after calling raiser we are going to train both your body and soul near this dragon canyon uuu how can this happen raiser shook his head while covering his face with both his hands please be resolved its nothing even if you have a deathlike experience you wont die since you are immortal while nodding my head hyoudou issei you should train as well go and run first the old man even said that to me i knew you would say that i also made up my mind and changed into mountain climbing gear that i prepared hey hey you are too slowuwaaaaaaaaaaah its going to freeze my fire is going to freeeeeeeze buuuuun on a snowy part of the mountain the yakitorisan was being chased by a dragon the light blue dragon was breathing out ice from its mouth as it was chasing raiser who had also changed into mountain climbing gear dammit raiserdono the shout you have to say during this training is dragon repeat after me dragon ddragon i was running on the snowy mountain a bit away from him at
the back the place we were running around isnt piled up with snow and it wasnt so cold that we would be shaking its daytime so it isnt snowing violently the lightblue dragon is a highlevel species called the blizzard dragon but man please look everyone it looks like a tragedy from back here after all he only looks like an adventurer who is being chased by a large dragon in the mountains oniisama how can you make a fuss with something like this ravel on top of the lightblue dragon was trying to put some spirit into raiser from up high the training started by doing some running first its quite hard to run since i have to step onto the snow which im not familiar with but it seems this will train my legs and hips a lot its hard but i was able to run thinking that this is all training above me is a bluescaled dragon its flying up in the sky while playing around with a supergiant touch screen monitor and hes singing with his nose he sure is different to the lightblue dragon in front of me it might be prejudice but seeing a
big dragon playing with a modern device sure does make my imagination crumble while i was thinking such a thing the blue dragon above me spoke sekiryuuteidono how is the rich boy from the house of phoenix doingeh ah well he seems to be having a hard time but it sure is crazy he really is weak i thought rich boys who are highclass devils were a bit more elegant but they seem to be much weaker than i thought its quite crazy he sure speaks in a light manner why is he so flashy it seems like hes an ace of the dragontribe called sprite dragon asias familiar the small dragon is also part of this tribe will it also become a flashy dragon like this in the future after running for an hour we took a break and i was drinking some water next to me raiser was on the ground breathing heavily im going to die his voice was weak hey hey even i can still run more he sure doesnt have any stamina you know that you havent been running for that long when i asked he replies with an unpleasant voice sshut up doing training
by living in the mountains is something barbarians do thats why reincarnated devils know nothing what are you saying even devils can become stronger by training so there is no loss by doing this you know im a pure highclass devil you know highclass devils have to live like a noble by taking importance in our blood and our talent my house is so great that i can take someone from the house of gremory who produced a maou as my fianc for me to do something so filthy like this ah that sure is the attitude of a genuine rich boy its still the first day you know its still too early for you to be whining well i was also troubled and scared at the beginning when i started living with a dragon like this thus the training in the mountains started looks like there is lots of trouble waiting ahead part 4 on the third day since we started living in the mountainsravel appeared while bringing a basket of food hhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii far away raiser was screaming while running on the snowy mountains being chased by a dragon do your best raiser ravel and i sat on a
rock jutting out of the snow and we started taking a break how is my brother doing ravel asks me worriedly hmm im not sure but even though hes complaining hes doing what he has to do even i was like that when being trained by old man tannin so i think he will manage after he gets used to it the reason why he couldnt stand up on his own two feet may be because hes spoiled i see im a bit relieved hearing that ravels expression softened this pancake sure is good i gave my feedback on the pancake i took out of the basket rreally i received ingredients from the dragonsan around here and there were ingredients that i didnt have so i couldnt bake it to my satisfaction yeah why is there a need for me to lie about it it really is good ravel sure is good at making cakes the moment i put it in my mouth the sweet taste spreads around along with a good sensation from it hearing my feedback she smiles with confidence by putting her hand on her mouth oof course isesama sure is lucky to be able to eat
the pancake i made i wish you taste it while being grateful to me yeah yeah wwhats with that response geez i woke up very early in the morning andearly in the morning nno i can make things like this in a short time i just happened to wake up early today this girl seems like shes acting high with so much richgirl quality but there is a pure part deep inside her by the way ravelin terms of school in the human world which year are you in i asked something i wanted to ask her for a long time its regarding her age i thought it would be rude to ask her directly so i ask her in terms of school years then i will specially answer your question in japanese high school i would be a firstyear firstyear seriously you are my junior then this is a surprise so shes a firstyear shes the same as konekochan and gasper compared to konekochan she is better developed and in some areas she has more growth than asia who is a secondyear i then looked at ravels body a bit lecherously no no a feeling of guilt was created
inside me after finding out that she is my junior next time i would like to wear kuou academys uniform o try it it will suit you of course i will definitely wear it ccan i also come and visit your home next time sure come whenever you want ththen i will come and visit without any hesitation its also the duty of a highclass devil to understand the living style of a commoner in the human world i decided it by myself but buchou wont get mad at mewill she but seeing ravels reaction theres no way i can decline ravel then tells meoh yes tonight riassama and the others will be coming to this mountain buchou and the others yes it seems there is a good hot spring near here hot spring so buchou and the others will go to the hot springs while coming to check us out huh gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah ah that was raisers scream so he received an attack from the dragon again huh with that another day of training ended safely part 5 that night i was inside my sleeping bag in the cave that we are using as our sleeping area and i couldnt
go to sleep hot springs buchou and others will take a bath gufufu my brain is turning into a paradise hot springs not just buchou but also akenosan and everyone else as well so i get to see oppai dancing around on this mountain i held onto my sexual desire for three days and im now unable to control myself you know that im at my delicate age right if i dont see oppai soon then i wont be able to remain normal i came here thinking seriously about fixing raiser but after hearing the words hot springs my thoughts were changed into lecherous thoughts yeah thats right this is how i am this is me i have to go to the hot springs if thats the case i have to leave this cave without raiser realising it i glanced in raisers direction i dont know why but hes quiet since we came here hes been complaining and saying things like how can a noble sleep in a cave and sleeping in a sleeping bag is the worst but tonight hes quiet this is strange i got out of my sleeping bag and checked on raiser what appeared from his
sleeping bag is a fake face it has a crappy drawing of a face on it shit dont tell me he was he listening to my conversation with ravel while he was running what ears i totally forgot about it hes a perverted bastard who has made a harem fuck buchou asia and akenosan i wont let you look at everyones naked bodies i was burning with rage i got into balance breaker on the spot and i flew out of the cave while covered in red armour that night on the mountain where the snow falls silently i had my dragon wings spread and was chasing after raiser at full speed bastard where did he go i already know the basic location of the hot springs since i asked a dragon i met as soon as i left the cave several minutes have passed since i started flying then something that looks like a fire swaying appears within my sight wings of fire raiser is flying i approached him immediately he turns around as if he noticed me chi so i was caught ah the way you spoke you really were trying to peek into the hot springs whats
wrong with me taking peek if there are women going into hot springs then its a mans duty to peek is that something a noble should be doinnnnnnnnng i wont forgive him this perverted yakitoriiiiiii i will protect the oppai of the girls in my group i went at him to stop him my charge was easily evaded in an air battle the yakitori has the advantage your attack is sharper than it was in the past but i just want to see riass breasts its not forgivable that you are the only one who can enjoy itthe bastard said some rubbish like that and released an enormous fire from his wings of flame are you an idiot theres no way i will let you see them shes my buchou i dodged the fire and send my demonic powers at him but that was also dodged both of us had the attacks we released hitting the mountains and made the snow fall along with an explosive sound im her former fianc do you think i can give up without seeing those huge oppai even once stand in my position and think i then started thinking for a moment certainly it
might be hard to give up but that is that and this is this more than that how lecherous are you to revive just because you want to see breasts you have high tension which is the total opposite of the time you were training why dont you train with that enthusiasm they said that he doesnt have any guts but he does something which doesnt lose to me called perverted guts and i also want to see the breasts of the priestess of thunder theyre also big right akenosans oppai im not going to forgive you now now im pissed those huge oppai only belong to meeeeeeeee goooooooooon dooooon dodooooooooon the whirls of flames and the aura of a dragon goes crazy on the mountain where snow is falling raiser and i were redoing that battle off the past in midair and we were approaching the hot spring little by little after more than ten minutes had passed since we started battling in midair zehaa zehaaraiser and i became tired since the opponent is immortal he comes back up no matter how many times i beat him he sure is persistent for a guy who was a hikikomori i
kind of know the reason why hes continuing to have a strong spirit by thinking about erotic things do you want to see buchous breasts that much of course you do i also want to look there arent many magnificent breasts like that i dont want this guy to know that you sure have become quite strong you can stay like that even in a midair battle which is an advantage for me man you are indeed terrifying sekiryuutei raiser says it while puffing i trained like crazy after that so i wont lose badly to you ever again the regeneration of the opponent is scary so i was also being persistent on beating him due to fear raisers regeneration has also gone down considerably i think i can win if i drag him into a stamina match its a bit far but i can see lights from the snow mountain looks like we cant do a noisy battle now it seems like buchou and the others will get out of the hot spring after being startled i also want to peek after all then i had an idea the way to defeat this guy i thought of it because
hes also a pervert and it will definitely work ah buchous raw oppai i looked towards the hot springs whaaaaaaaaaaaat raiser fell for the bait and looked that way its a lie he really fell for it your guards dowwwwwn dogaaan guwaaaaaaaah i kicked raiser on his medulla oblongata and he was blown awaybut aaaaaaaaah he went flying towards the hot springs i kicked him with too much force i then flew in the direction he went raiser fell into the spa head first his foot was coming up it seems like he really is knocked out i deactivated my armour and did a victory pose oh ii beat raiser wwell even if this guy was able to fight with perverted guts he wasnt in his best condition so i dont know how much joy i can feel with this i did realise that i am stronger than i was six months ago more than that i saved buchou from him again huh didnt i come to this mountain to fix raiser but i ended up beating him yyeah it cant be helped since this was to protect buchou i thought i heard a loud noise so it was you
ise a familiar voice when i turned around a fullynaked buchou was therei started to get a nosebleed after seeing her soft breasts yeah those are my oppai ara ara isekun isesan you were also here to be expected from ise so youve come to peek at us akenosan asia xenovia its a raw oppai parade i started to shed tears of joy at seeing the girls in my group naked and isesama oniisama ravels voice when i lookeda fullynaked ravel was standing there so ravel was also in the hot springs she has quite the oppai actually this is i stared at her breasts while having a nosebleed ravel realised that and hid her breasts immediately as her face went red then wings of fire appeared from her back tthis is isesama you ecchiiiiiiiiiii goooooooooooooooon gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa having been shot with a massive fire from ravel raiser and i ended up burning in the snow mountain we somehow returned from the hot springs where i was lying down all burned and raiser was exhausted im glad raiser didnt see buchou and everyones oppai that alone is a good result then raiser says to me i will give up on rias
so please let me see riass oppai next time fuck you yakitori bastardas i thought this guy is my enemy raiser and i started our second battle that day after that raiser was cured quite a lot with this incident and it appears he overcame his fear of dragonslife 5 armageddon at sports day part 1 it happens right after my mountain training with raiser on my way home from school this is the first thing azazelsensei says after catching me yo ise dont you want to move your body around and i mean body theres a good event coming up he had a mischievous smile hes up to something even looking back at what happened in the past when he had a smile like that the majority of them were bad news i dont want to its something worthless again right im making everyone wait so i will be leaving now hold on its a sports event dont you want to participate in a sports event sensei asks while pulling my arm ssports eventyou say i looked at him dubiously and he pulls something out of his pocket yeah an event will be held among my organisation soon so
i want to call you in as a guest the organisationso the grigori huh and you will be doing sports for that event and im the guest does that mean hes inviting me as the oppai dragon eeven if you say that all of a sudden remember how you said you wanted to meet fallen angel beauties hey boss there are some girls with huge oppai with us you know sensei shows me several photoswow there are beautiful older women with black wings who are doing seductive poses and wearing costumes ffor real wwhat should i do i received the photos and started staring at them oh man everyone sure has nice bodies holy this girl over here has oppai which are too massive but she still has nice curves on her hips i cant hold it if i participate in that socalled sports event i wonder if he will introduce me to them if thats the case i dont mind signing this contract as i was about to receive the contract from him mgh azazel i have told you isekun belongs to our side a crimsonhaired man came out from the shadows uwaa ssirzechssama why is he in a
place like this i was perplexed by his sudden appearance but sensei made a noise with his tongue chi looks like the maousama came fuhahahahahaha farewell sensei leaves the scene immediately after saying a phrase that sounded villainous sirzechssama put his hand on my shoulder and breathed out he sure is a man i cant take my eyes off my brother was almost going to turn into a participant for the fallen angels ii dont get it why did sirzechssama come here and why did sensei run does it have something to do with the sports event of the grigori i questioned sirzechssama uumm sirzechssama wwhats going on yes i will explain it to you once rias entire group assembles the maousama suddenly showed up in the human world it was decided that he will come to my house along with buchou and the others who we met up witha sports day among the threegreatpowers in a guest room of the hyoudou residence the rias gremory group including myself exclaimed sirzechssama who just explained the details drinks his tea and then nods yes to be on friendlier terms with the other members of the three great powers it was decided
that we will use sports to achieve greater cohesion so we will be having a sports event or in other words an athletics day so we are doing an athletics day as a gathering for the three great powers oh so is this the athletics day which sensei was talking about earlier but why did sensei lie calling it an event for the fallen angels then run away from sirzechssama ah i was told about the athletics day earlier from heaven irina who is a reincarnated angel says while putting her hand up oh yeah irina is part of heaven after all of course she will be informed about events like this sirzechssama continues while smiling of course i want all of you to take part as participants for the devils this is an important exchange of culture so i really wish for the cooperation of rias gremorys group having isekun at the top as the oppai dragon all of you are popular in the underworld hearing that everyone seemed to have a good impression of it so they were saying athletic day huh and seems interesting i dont think that things like this are bad its good to have
interaction between the three great powers since its been about terrorists targeting the underworld and heaven lately it certainly seems that having this event between the members of the alliance will lead to an improvement in the relations between them but there is one thing i dont get i put my hand up and ask sirzechssama uumm what was the reason sensei was asking me to join him sirzechssama tells me while laughingmost likely he was trying to lure you to their side and make you take part as a participant for the fallen angels your popularity and sacred gear seem like they will give influence to the activities after all geez that governor sure acts fast at strange points grayfia told me that something might happen so i came to check on you on my day off and she was right iis that right so i was almost put down as a participant for the fallen angels nggh he sure is a sneaky governor at these kinds of things but i sure wanted to meet those erotic women you were imagining something lecherous just now werent you konekochan who is on my lap started to pinch my cheek it
hurts konekochan then buchou got up and told sirzechssama i understand oniisama if you are alright with having us then we will happily accept and participate with that it was decided that we the gremory group will be participating in the athletics day for the devils and will compete with the angels and fallen angels since we dont have that much interaction with the angels and fallen angels im looking forward to the event part 2 bang bang bang the fireworks for the athletics day were shot we the gremory group have come to the stadium where the event for the three great powers will be held the place we will be using is the same game field used for rating games so its quite spacious wow just like irina there are angels with white wings and a ring above their heads there are also fallen angels with black wings of course there are many devils here but since we dont meet angels and fallenangels that often it feels new and im getting nervous everyone is wearing a jerseythe angels are white the fallen angels are black and the devils are red thats why we are also wearing red jerseys
since sensei is the representative of the fallen angels and irina is a participant for the angels they are not here so just for today we are enemies ah thats the oppai dragon switch princess is so cute thats the sekiryuutei and princess rias hellcatchan im getting so turned on just walking a bit makes us get attention from different people positively it appears that we are well recognised by those among the three great powers this is also thanks to the tokusatsu programme chichiryuutei oppai dragon huh i found irina shes talking to a person with golden wings and a noble atmospherebut if i remember correctly that angelsama is irina realises and she approaches us with the man while waving her hand at me ah riassan isekun and everyone you all came the man smiles at us its been so long everyone it is i the chief angel michael the last time we met was the negotiations between the three great powers yes it is michaelsan who currently stands at the top of heaven wow im seeing the legendary angelsama once again he looks so divine it feels as though he will give us a large amount of damage
just by looking at him ssame to you too and im sorry for greeting you so late hello its been so long michaelsama thank you for taking care of us back then hello buchou everyone and i greet him at the same time oh man greeting the person at the top of heaven sure makes me nervousim so fortunate that i get to meet the michaelsama im so glad i joined the gremory group rossweissesan who is meeting michaelsan for the first time is deeply moved yes lets play fair and square and enjoy ourselves today there isnt even a slight sense of evil intent in his expression he looks so bright so this is the smile of the top seraph its as if we are being blessed by him michaelsama the opening ceremony is about to start a sudden voice when i looked in that directiona gentle looking angel oneesan with curly blonde hair approaches us its an angelsama with lots of wings growing from her back uoooooooo shes a superbeautiful oneesan her figure is super excellent and her oppai are huge its great that she has huge oppai while shes an angel and she looks so divine michaelsan
put his hand on his chin its as though he completely forgot about it oh is that so time sure does fly quickly only by greeting other leaders oh i still havent introduced her yet the one over here is also one of the four great seraphs like me and how do you do i am one of the four great seraphs and my name is gabriel the beautiful oneesan introduced herself while smiling at us she looks so gentle and her smile is top notch shes one of the four great seraphs woooow she is the most beautiful and also the strongest woman in heaven the gabrielsama she happens to be very popular in the underworld as well irina explains to us with pride and enthusiasm hmm so shes also popular in the underworld huh well if shes this beautiful then of course she will be popular not only michaelsama but gabrielsama is also hereyeah it really is a magnificent day today asia and xenovia had their eyes sparkling with lights and they had an expression of being really hyped while holding their hands together for the two of them who were related to the church both michaelsan and
gabrielsan must have been existences that were far from their reach living high up in the sky wwell they really are people that are actually living above the sky the one who serafall leviathansama secretly views as her rival is gabrielsama buchou whispers in my ear for real so leviathansama sees her as her enemy huh if it isnt ise oh and michael is also here azazelsensei in a black jersey comes over while bringing a man with good build oh if it isnt azazel its been so long you look energetic as always i will say that should by my line oh sensei and michaelsan are shaking hands while smiling but they are releasing intense pressure to the surroundings the space between them started to get distorted with their intense pressure please dont start a fight between the last bosses in a place like this it feels like this field will get blown away easily more like the clashes between the organisations has already begun aakeno there is a weird vibe between barakielsan and akenosan from their stand points the father is a leader of the fallen angels while the daughter is on the devils side so it means
they would be competing against each other in the activities they had some issues before but that should have been dealt with in a prior incidentlooks away akenosan looks away without saying a word barakielsan who saw that appears to be in deep shock and has his mouth wide open akenosan made a naughty face while smiling and sticking her tongue out so only we could see it ah so shes just teasing her father im relieved that both father and daughter are getting along well to all the participants from each faction the opening ceremony will commence at the centre of the grounds so please gather i repeat will the oh its the announcement the opening ceremony for the sports activities is going to start now all participants from each faction gathered in the centre of the field we are split into three teams of angels fallenangels and devils we were lined up in the line for the devils umm i hereby declare and promise that i will compete against others fairly and will follow the spirit of sportsmanship the person representing all the participants gave an oath and the opening ceremony was about to end if i remember
correctly they are following the sports events of the japanese system so each of the programmes are adjusted into similar procedures hmm looking through the booklet it sure does have japanese activities such as itemborrowing runs and breadeat and runs im finding it a bit weird and am tilting my head so kiba explains they are doing these activities because they found the activities of japanese sports events interesting remember how there was a sports festival at kuou academy people affiliated with the alliance were secretly there apparently they had lots of fun watching it hmm so there were people related with the threegreatpowers there huhthe opening ceremony finished and we moved to the cheering seats for the respective teams the activities that i will be participating in solely by myself are the obstacle race and itemborrowing runs they are also asking me to participate in the in the team relay you know sirzechssama told me that he wants me to participate and said i can even use balancebreaker the ones im participating in as a team are the balltoss game and the cavalry battle on my way towards our seating area i went past the fallen angel team and
azazelsensei in a black jersey gave a strong speech to his fallenangel teams listen all of you this is a war also known as the exchange programme so i wont complain even if you guys go nuts even if we formed an alliance you guys must have so much stuff you wanted to tell the angels and devils such as the items in heaven are too expensive and those equal trades that devils follow are frickin noisy and so on you must be keeping so much stress within you so go as crazy as you want today i will allow it ooooooooooooooooooo along with energetic shouts i also heard some anguished roars i mean the fallen angels have their eyes glowing very mysteriously so do they have so much stuff inside them that they want to express to the angels and devils the angel team in white jerseys are gathered next to the fallen angels team hahaha the fallen angels sure are energetic there were some negative responses from the angels who were watching the fallen angels team talk we might become fallen if we were to go along with their flow it will be over if we fall even
once so i hope the fallen angels and devils understand thatfrom the sounds of it the angels also have things they want to say to the fallen angels listen well everyone michaelsan was emitting a dangerous goldenaura from his body while smiling its our usual teaching give divine punishment to the heretics we have a duty to follow the job of the nowdeceased god give them lights sir give them their judgment didnt all of you just say lilights andjudgment its too scary isnt this sports event turning into a representative war between the factions now since the devils gathered around sirzechssama we went there as well ara sona i finally found you rias lets do our best today we encountered sonakaichou oh yeah sonakaichou is also the next heiress of the house of sitri who are highclass devils so it wont be weird if they were called here they did say that those from famous households are participating it seems like buchou knew that sonakaichou was participating ah found saji he also recognises me and comes to talk lets both work hard for the devils today hyoudou yeah lets do our best during our conversation sirzechssamas speech began from
appearances heaven and the grigori are all full of energy we also have to do our best so we dont lose even if these are activities to improve our relations it will be rude to hold back so go all out sirzechssama had a refreshing smile bbut we have to go all out huh armageddon all the devils shout at oncewhy is the shout armageddon it sounds really dangerous after hearing sirzechssamas speech all of the devils became very enthusiastic but i realised that i was thrown into a dangerous position even though the maou has the most peaceful smile i have a bad feeling about this part 3 thats what i thought but the sports day started smoothly maybe something will act as the catalyst for a war thats what i thought at first while being scared but now i can give cheers to the devils without any worries we were cheering for the devils who are running in the grounds a mat was put down in our cheering area where we are resting my comrades who will be participating in the activities are either warming up or relaxing their bodies i also started to stretch my body with
kiba by the way asia isnt here asia who has the power to heal is on standby at her personal tent to heal any injuries that occur go go devils the one who is doing a cheering performance at the front is the maou serafall leviathan she was cheering for the devils dressed as a magical girl while her assistants are dancing behind her now its about time for the obstacle race which i will be participating in will those who will be participating in the obstacle race gather in the allocated area please i just heard the announcement that was made alright im off then i tell everyone yes do your besti will be cheering for you after being encouraged by buchou and akenosan the two great oneesamas i walked towards the allocated location obstacle race i lined up along with all the other participants hold onim in the first row so i will be one of the first ones running huh im feeling insecure we will now be commencing the obstacle race oh so its finally starting i made the stance to run on your marks get setbang i ran just after hearing the bang it seems like
i did well with my starting dash there are two people from each faction in total six people are running towards the finish line the obstacles were fairly simple we had to cross a balance beam go under a net and kick certain kinds of balls we progressed normally and finally reached the last obstacle gyaooooooooooooooooooon kyueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen gowangowan what appeared while making such dangerous cries werea nineheaded enormous snake a monstrous dog with three heads and an ominous bird which is spreading its wings what is that is it some kind of monster trade fair i am so shocked that my eyes pop out when i looked the other participants were stunned me included wait that threeheaded dog wasnt that the hell dog called cerberus i remember very well since ive fought it before for the last obstacle we positioned each of the monsters a serpent with deadly poison that can kill angels and devils with ease hydra the gatedog of hell cerberus and the ominous bird ziz is also present so please try to break through the monsters we positioned each of the monsters my aaaaaaaaaassss oh if it isnt hyoudou issei one of the monsters talks to me

waited for my turn it became my turn i stood at the starting line and readied myself to dash on your marks get setbang hell yeah i succeed in my starting dash i went ahead marvellously and picked up an envelope who the heck is yakitorisensei2 which one of you is the tasogareiro no utatsukai here3 it looks as though the criteria of other participants is very hard now what about mine i opened the envelope and read what was written on the paper my brain stopped for a moment when i checked what was written it simply says siscon4 i gulped and then headed towards the vip seats looking for a certain someone sirzechssama please come with me mu so im the item okay i got it i ran towards the goal while holding hands with sirzechssama the participant from the devil team got first place yeah i got first place again i did the victory pose and sirzechssama asks me with a lively faceby the way isekun what was the item you needed to borrow maou a person with crimsonhair or maybe its oniisan oh my im feeling embarrassed wwell thats basically it i answered him while looking
to the side hahahaha i feel honoured sirzechssama seems very happy i cant tell him there is no way i can tell him there is no way i can tell him that siscon was written serafallsama also would have been fine but i ended up asking sirzechssama thats because he is a siscon he adores riasbuchou after all but there is no way i can tell him that i decided i will take this paper to my grave with me balltoss game this time it is the balltoss game where it requires all the participants from each team to participate there is a basket placed on a very long rod and we throw balls with our teams colour into it all participants were on stand by waiting for the start now the balltoss game which has all the angels devils and fallen angels will begin i picked up many balls from the ground at the same time the signal was given and i threw them into the basket i started picking them up together with buchou and when i was about to throw them again throw the lights towards those deeeeeevils chudooooon these are our grudges from the past doooooooonits
armageddon god damn iiiiiit you want us to play the flute of gjallarhorn huh dodododooooooooooon the sound of explosions can be heard everywhere and instead of the ball game a battle started what are all of you doing instead of throwing the balls meant for the basket the angels and fallen angels are throwing balls of light at the devils the devils retaliate by using their demonic powers the fallen angels even started to sneakily attack the angels will the angels and fallen angels please stop throwing lights at the devils theyll perish hey you dont start throwing spears of light as if you are doing a javelin throw that is a totally different activity and can the devils also stop attacking are you guys idiots are all of you actually daft from the sound of it the announcer has lost their wits its turning into an outrageous situation this is fun isnt it ise buchous really into it i was in shock and two leaders appear before my eyes yo michael this is your end for meeting me here fufufu today you have the same eyes from a certain war its only filled with evil its azazelsensei and michaelsan
they are in front of each other and glaring as well they look like they are about to explode yeah it makes me remember about the past youhow dare you announcing the report i wrote when i was in heaven in front of everyone sensei says while throwing a ball at michaelsan sensei that ball isnt meant to be used for throwing at the angels its something you throw into the basket michaelsan dodges it and made a provoking smile oh you are talking about that its the compilation of your data reports correct not only did it have a long title and explanation which was writtenas the compilation report of the ultimate sacred gear that i thought of you also included your own illustrations of it i do think you have a wonderful talent so i ended up passing it to everyone in the form of a leaflet during the war i really wanted everyone to see it i think the name of it was blazer shining aura darkness blade correct that was an excellent idea hearing that senseis face turned red and he started throwing more balls shut up because of that i had the frickin leaders of
my group call me blazer shining aura darkness blade governor for a while you know they were saying hey azazel can you send the blazer shining aura darkness blade as the secret weapon and you are going to eliminate the enemies using the blazer shining aura darkness blade now right and also azazelsan where is your dinner knife also known as the blazer shining aura darkness blade god damn iiiiiit hahaha that was rude of me dodging the balls thrown by sensei michaelsan also threw a ball somehow it seems he has had a huge grudge and a lot of pain for a long time so there was also a time when sensei was young huh but both of them looked like they are enjoying it then akenosan was confronting barakielsan aakeno towards barakielsan who didnt know what he should do akenosan tells him while holding her hands together with tear filled eyes tousama please help us that was such a sadlooking cute expression barakielsan who heard that uuuooooo he took hold of many red balls belonging to the devils team and threw them to the basket while shouting sensei becomes shocked seeing that barakiel hhey what have you done
throw the black ballsim sorry azazel my daughter akeno this is all for the only daughter i haaaaaaave barakielsan brushed off the governors words and he started working hard for his daughter ufufu akenosan herself was throwing the balls together with her father happily it must be akenosans prank but it seems shes enjoying the fact that she is participating in the activity with her father the three great powers appear to be getting carried away rossweissesan says while sighing yes this is truly troublesome cavalry battle the next activity was also a team match a cavalry battle some participants formed a group to become the horse and another participant the rider goes on top the tension of everyone within the three great powers became weird and now it has turned into a battlefield with hostility and killing intent everywhere we made two teams buchou who is a rider with akenosan carrying buchou while rossweissesan and konekochan are supporting them from the rear and me who is a rider with kiba carrying me while gasper and xenovia are supporting us from the rear we will now start the cavalry battle along with the signal from the announcer all the riders
go forward towards the battlefield oryaaaaaaah i will make it a catastrophe die angels dont look down on angeeeels we will give you the last judgement angels and fallen angels perish everyone is fighting while using powers of light and demonic powers this is a war this is supposed to be an activity where you can win by taking the hat from the rider you knowreincarnated angels make a formation we can unleash our power when we have the right cards formation full house like hell we would allow that this is an all out battle between reincarnated devils and reincarnated angels reincarnated this and reincarnated that all of you increased your numbers like that why dont a few of the angels fall down to us huh uwaa it really is turning into a war balls of light spears of light fire and lighting created from demonic powers are being thrown around everywhere hmph i wont lose to angels and fallen angels the one who is blasting away several angels and fallen angels isthe next heir of the house of great king sairaorg baelsan the way he uses his strength is amazing wwwhere should we attack them from we need
to take them down before they take us down please calm down ace irina the horse on which irina is the rider was having a hard time trying to think of how to attack in the ground which had turned into chaos everyone please dont continue that war here its coming back that war is coming back completely im telling you to stop damn iiiiiiit hyahaha looks like the announcer is also into it while making a scream there ive got her hat the one who took the hat from a female angel elegantly is buchou only around buchou its like a peaceful cavalry battle oh ise so you were here sensei approaches what is it sensei aare you planning to fight me i became cautious but sensei shakes his head and tells me to come closer i approached him and listened to what he said wwhat did you just say i was completely unaware of that wait im allowed to do that what sensei said came to me as a bolt from out of the blue its like that so im depending on you ise sensei sends me off after putting his hand on my shoulder isekun what did
he tell you the horse kiba asks mebut i ignored him i just shouted charge ahead kiba trust me ookay but why do you have a nosebleed did he tell you something improper again fufufu he sure has good intuition the single word sensei said to me made my brain fill with my greed i dont know whats going on but lets believe in ise ii will also believe in him and follow him to the end gasper and xenovia are willing to follow me you guys are great i increased my demonic powers and made the imagination in my head stronger i then put both my hands forward and charge towards the angels and fallen angels but the ones i will be taking on is just the women sorry for stripping you even though i apologised to them i started touching the bodies of the female riders i then shouted out while making a cool pose and unleashing my demonic powers dress break strip strip strip strip strip strip the jerseys of the women i touched started to blast and it became a parade of naked bodies kyaaaaaaaaaaiyaaaaaaaaaaa nosebleed my nosebleed started to burst forth aamazing not only the
innocentlooking angels but also the seductivelooking fallen angels are naked they are all fully naked oppai asses and thighs are all observable ooo seeing that the men from the devils side and fallen angels side became overjoyed and were having nosebleeds on the other hand uoooo a naknaked body of a woman this is bad if we think improper thingswe will fall oppaibuttsthighsuuu we are going to fall but those white skins are so radiant the male angels started to become hesitant and painful at this erotic situation and their wings kept on turning black and white i see thats because there are many pure people among the angels and they have a possibility to turn into fallen angels when they see something erotic like this the same phenomenon that occurs to irina when she gets tormented is happening to them it sure is tough being an angel so they fall into the dangerous state of becoming a fallen angel by seeing a single boob im glad im a devil im okay no matter how many oppai i see oppai are the best after all seeing that azazelsensei laughs loudly make the angels fall make them fall i tell ya
fuhahahaha falling with just seeing a womans naked body proves that you guys are keeping so much inside ya what an evil person sensei urged me to do this because he was aiming for this he really is an evil last boss sensei i was just used by him iit isnt my fault i think we fallen angels cant fall nor are we scared of lights we have the least number among the three great powers but we are superior to angels and devils in this situation fuhahaha now ise your next target is hersensei points at a certain beauty it was the seraph gabrielsan dont you want to see the naked body of the most beautiful woman in heaven sensei urges me once again i i do want to see it i turned into a beast faithful to my lust and charged towards gabrielsan by making my horse go towards her the naked body of the most beautiful woman in heaven oppai belonging to a seraph an angels oppaaaaaaaiiiii this is definitely wrong aah what are we doing amen uwaaaaan even though they are in confusion kiba xenovia and gasper are following my lead aara the sekiryuutei gentleman is
coming this way gabrielsan tilts her head while gazing this way with her innocent eyes aaaah i want to see the oppai of that beauty i then got ready to use dress break once again and gon i received an unexpected punch to my face our horse became unbalanced with that impact and i also fell on the ground any shameless behaviour further than this is forbidden hentai dragonsenpai konekochan steps on my head while making noises with both her hands kkonekochans punch really does work in this way the cavalry battle also ended like a war decisive battle baton relaythe joint sports activity has finally entered the last activity its going to be the baton relay for each team the chosen participants are waiting at designated points now the sports day which has been going on for a long time has finally reached the climax the announcer stirs the field with his announcement the points each team has is quite close and it became a situation where this last baton relay will determine the winners i became the anchor for this relay im already on standby in my balance breaker state fufufu so you are my opponent huh ise
pplease take it easy on me the anchor for the fallen angels is sensei i only have a bad feeling about this lets do our best the anchor for the angels is gabrielsan im in grief that i couldnt use dress break on her at the cavalry battle earlier rather i was scolded strongly by buchou and konekochan after the cavalry battle now the final match is about to begin bang the pistol for the relay was shot and along with rhythmical bgm the participants of each team ran the first runner for the devils team is kiba with his god speed he should be able to pull it off thats what i thought but the participant from the fallen angels shot lights towards kiba kiba evades it swiftly but what a cowardly act is that even allowed i protested to sensei but cant see anythinghe ignored me what a horrible sensei hes such a lousy governor even so the relay was going on and the participants were running around the field finally the participant before mesirzechssama ran so faaaaaast the maou is also serious uooooooo i wont lose i wont lose in front of my daughter akeno it wont
be allowed for i uriel the flame of god to lose against a maou barakielsan is covered with holy lightning and urielsan is covered with an enormous amount of holy flames their intense speed wasnt behind sirzechssama there is an ultimate battle between the last bosses in a place like this and sirzechssama finally reaches me i leave the rest to you isekun yes i took the baton and flew ahead while igniting the boosters on my back oryaaaaah i head towards the finishing line with insane speed but toryaaaaah here is the weapon which i have been preparing for in a situation like this sensei catches up with me from the behind in his hand he was holding onto a sword which looks like a mixture of light and darkness this is the blazer shining aura darkness blade that all of you were picking on me about sensei started wielding the sword while blowing away the scenery of the field with it seeing that the leaders of each faction were in shock what so the blazer shining aura darkness blade was completed mu so thats the blazer shining aura darkness blade sensei starts attacking me with the blazer shining
aura darkness blade i somehow dodged it the strike which missed me carves deeply into the ground what powerhey are you trying to kill me can you even call yourself a governor and a sensei isnt this supposed to be a sports day its waaaaaaar i wont lose to a maou and chief angel im number 1 this is bad senseis tension is at his max and his brain is working the wrong way sensei and i started facing each other in front of the goal and we started battling with fist and sword oo governor azazel and the oppai dragon started battling in front of the goal even the announcer stirs it up this is a good opportunity i shall test ises strength come my student what the heck are you saying i will punch you last bosssensei i hit sensei without hesitation when i said that how dare you for you to hit me you you should treat your elders with a bit more respect senseis sharp kick hits precisely on my head ow are you even in the situation to say that while sensei and i were hitting each other i will be going first then gabrielsan
goes past us and she crossed the finish line gooooooal the one who conquered the baton relay is the angels team aaaaagh seeing that both sensei and i become shocked see look what happened because i tagged along with sensei she crossed the goal before us its your fault sensei no its your fault for not being taken down by me much soonersensei and i glare at each other this person is definitely the bad one he is the governor of the fallen angels after all oi a mysterious pressure surrounds me and sensei when i lookedthe fallen angels were surrounding sensei all of them were releasing killing intent from their body and they were glaring at sensei sharply i thought i shouldnt be here and sneak out quietly but buchou was there ise what have you done i had my head poked by buchou who was sighing uu im really sorry i was lured in by sensei and showed everyone something pathetic im filled with so much guilt towards my comrades and sensei besides me sensei tries to run away quietly but azazel lets talk for a bit being caught by the vicegovernor shemhaza he gets dragged towards the
fallen angels team iim sorry shemhaza ii got a bit too cocky hahaha forgive me please sensei apologise but shemhaza says with a smile no gyaaaaah at the centre of the fallen angels team a certain governor made a scream sensei please reflect on your actions with this buchou then pats my cheek you will also have to reflect on your actions once we get home okay but you did very well today yes thank you very much ah buchou you really do watch over me that alone was worth working hard todaylike that the great sports day ended with the victory of the angels team maybe everyone from each faction was able to release their stress so they all had a satisfied looking face by the end of it seeing that there was a discussion of lets do it again next year it was a fun sports day but i dont want to be involved in a dangerous event like this ever againextra life the worry of the nextnext heirsama part 1 in the morning of a weekend after the chaos caused by an army of monsters in the underworld after breakfast i was shocked to see the person
who came to visit my house its been awhile everyone it is i millicas gremory a crimsonhaired boy with a bag on his back came to visit millicas gremorysama the only son of the maou sirzechssama and his wife who is the strongest queen grayfiasan for the house of gremory he is the next heir after rias a real prince an oujisama 5 he visited while doing a proper introduction i did hear from rias beforehand that a guest would be coming to visit from the house of gremory but i never thought it would be millicassama i thought it would either be sirzechssama or grayfiasan after introducing himself to my parents in the living room we moved up to the vip room its been awhile since i last met him but his introduction and actions are filled with elegance he really is showing how rich boys who have been raised properly should act also his clothes are noble attire for children he looks like an intelligent child like always when i was a kid i wore a tshirt and shorts while running around this area like an idiot with my mates my parents also speak about the past where
i didnt even know the letter s for study here is your black tea any sugar if i remember you always have two teaspoons of sugar right akenosan was giving tea to millicassama yes thank you akenoneesamaah so he cant drink black tea without sugar im relieved that he has a childish side to him also he calls akenosan akenoneesama huh well she is the eldest member among rias group and she has interacted with millicassama more than any of us our group and irina gathered in the vip room kiba and gasper also came after we called them millicassama isnt nervous at all even though he is surrounded by us who are older than him to be expected from the son of a maou when millicassama looked at rias rias nods with a smile seeing that millicassama spoke i came here today to be under riasneesama and everyone in the group for observation observation observingwhat i asked after finding it weird then millicassama says with a smile while putting his body forward yes i came here because i wanted to see the ways of devils in the human world the ways in the human world he wants toobserve that
rias stood up and stood behind millicassama while resting her hands on his shoulder thats how it is there will be a time when millicas makes his own group and makes a pact with humans this boy knows this himself very well but he said he wants to actually see the devils that are living in the human world right yes i want to see from up close the living style of everyone here who are famous in the underworld so thats how it is the next next heirsama is interested in the ways of devils at such a young age i will repeat myself but i didnt think about my future when i was a kid you know i think i was thinking about womens breasts the whole time ah thats still the same even now i havent chaaaanged i havent changed even a bit hearing the words of the intelligent millicassama i could only cry at the reality of myself not changing at allits like that so for several days from now lets live together with him everyone please take care of him please take care of me lets get along everyone also replied to millicassama theres no
reason to decline him rias important nephew hes also the important boy of the house of gremory its a good opportunity so i will open up to him akenoneesama please take care of me from today millicassama says and bows his head to akenosenpai ara ara its millicaskuns wish after all i have no problem with it akenosan also responds with a smile she has an expression which tells me she adores millicassama very much millicassama also looks at asia i heard from riasneesama that asianeesama is someone who is like a little sister to riasneesama if thats the case then asianeesama is neesama to me as well hearing that asia opens her mouth she must have heard something she didnt see coming she was having a hard time respondingbut she says while being deeply moved and shivering oh mywhat should i do isesan having the son of maousama call me oneesama is too much for me but i feel very happy i think i understand how she feels when i was also called iseniisama by millicassama it was too much for someone like me with low status but i also felt joy you can be happy about it sincerely
then millicassama what do you think about xenovia and irina over here i made millicassama take his interest on the remaining two members of the church trio oh this sure makes me nervous so what does the son of a maou think about meeven an angel like me is really keen to hear it despite being nervous xenovia and irina fixed their posture which is a rare thing as they were waiting for the words of the boy with crimson hair yes xenoviasan is a holy sword wielder correct i also watched the rating game you looked really amazing when you defeated the opponent with absolute power hearing millicassamas praises xenovia nods her head confidently fufufu you sure understand it very well however millicassama continues but since you hold many abilities for the holy sword i think you would be able to fight as a techniquetype by using a bit more of the traits of your holy sword for example cutting down your opponent without them realising it by using the transparency sword and also using the mimic sword as a camouflage while you charge up a huge amount of aura and i think it might be good using the
transparency sword and mimic sword at the same time even if your power is strong people would research about it after a while its not like you will always have gaspersans support like in the bael match to not let that happen you have to millicassama started to talk about her bad points its quite accurate and hes talking about the parts which would make xenovia hurt xenovia who is a powertype knight looks even smaller after being told off by a small child about the same thing other group members always tell her yyeahi willbe careful from now shes in shock xenovias face looks gloomy please say more i thank you very much kiba is crying with joy at millicassamas words with tearful eyes lately kiba was going on about the importance of a techniquetype during the battles xenovia laughed that off by saying i can just blow those things away by increasing my power further with training but it seems like shes in pain after hearing that today hearing comments about xenovia who is her friend irina nods her head stronglyufufu looks like xenovia received accurate remarks from millicassama you have to be careful from now okay so
what do you think about me irina points at and asks about herself millicassama says it with a smileyes you are the selfproclaimed angel correct i have heard rumours about you its not selfproclaimed i am a real angel irina protests with tearful eyes yes lately irina has been called the selfproclaimed angel by people related to her wwell she always says im an angel with confidence it cant be helped if people who have doubts about her being an angel call her selfproclaimed i was told that rather than acting individually a reincarnated angel can use their actual traits more efficiently by working as a group the brave saints system which heaven created by using the idea of evil pieces is the twelve cards which each of the seraph and highlevel angels have to use to make people reincarnate into an angel it seems like each highlevel angel chooses the suit of their liking though the ones with a fixed suit are michaelsan with spades gabrielsan with hearts raphaelsan with clubs and urielsan with diamonds they say that mostly humans have reincarnated unlike devils who choose by strength regardless of species heaven chooses and reincarnates those who are strong
followers and who are very talented as their main targets the brave saints system just like the traits of each of the chess pieces of the evil pieces has a special ability of their own those were based on card games for example black jack each suit gather reincarnated angels and then make it 21 for example each suit prepares reincarnated angels with the number 4 6 and 10 and if they make them team up with the ace1 irina and cooperate with her they say that they would be able to unleash overwhelming power also they added in the pokers system as well the five highlevel angels or seraphs who are the kings gathers representing their cards from ace to queen and by forming a hand it will give birth to a certain power the good point is that this will not only work amongst the ones in the same group but also with other groups which will make it possible for teamwork with other groupsof course the effect will be stronger if it is within the same group i heard that when they get a royal straight flush the power is unbelievable the interesting part is that its
similar to the devils reincarnating system but also differentalso the trump card known as the joker doesnt belong to any group but has the role of the joker for the whole of heaven i heard just like in a card game it is a powerful card with many roles sensei also said if there was a rating game among the devils and angels with different systems it will be heated up to the extreme i cant even imagine what kind of match it would turn out to be so maybe irina who has no role if shes by herself cant say anything if someone calls her a selfproclaimed angel wwell irina is also getting a lot stronger so i think she is capable of fighting by herself i still havent given my formal introduction yet i am the rook rossweisse its a pleasure to meet you rossweissesan gave a formal introduction oh yeah rossweissesan who became the last member to join basically hasnt met millicassama at all she has been in the same place as him and has seen his face but i think this is her first time introducing herself to him facetoface yes you are rossweissesan correct my
kaasama told me she said that rossweissesan is a wonderful woman who can take care of things herself i think it would be great if i can learn good things from rossweissesan hearing that rossweissesan strokes her hair while being confident in herself fufufu so grayfiasama has such an opinion about me i feel very honoured about this so people who take a good look at me really understand me very well millicaskun i will teach you about selfmanagement first lets go to a 100 yen shop after this i will teach you the beauty of japan there stop dont teach the goodness of japan at a 100 yen shop no a 100 yen shop is indeed convenient and good but please stop teaching him the good parts of japan over there hell have a misunderstanding i have heard about grayfiasans opinion towards rossweissesan before but grayfiasan doesnt know that rossweissesan is a 100 yen shop valkyrie and that she is really unfortunate its a bad influence to teach weird knowledge to millicassama who is so pure he is the son of a maou you know itll be a big problem if he learns all the things about this womans
side of being poori couldnt finish all my opinion about this so i took a breath and ask rias millicassama will be staying at my house to observe the living style of us who live in japan thats how it is right rias nods yes it might trouble you otousama and okaasama but please do take care of him that wont be a problem dad and mum did give a warm welcome just before yeah the moment dad and mum saw millicassama oh my how adorable riassans nephew so this is sirzechssans son hes really different from ise when he was small it must be because of the environment and the way we raised him this makes me realise once again that our teaching wasnt good right kaasan yes very true because we didnt raise him properly our sonbecame somethinglike thiswho is an embodiment of sexual desire it seems they were having regrets when they compared millicassama and me when i was a kid mum is even crying out while putting her hand on her mouth you know that your son is in front of you they are so rude but is the reason why i feel like apologising a
bit maybe because i realise this myself also when they looked at millicassama would a grandson look like this yes the red hair and the handsome face of gremorysan it would be good if riassans genes turn out to be stronger it appears there was a view that only my parents have i just want them to be quiet and stay still now i made a sigh but rias looks around and asks everyoneanyway i ask everyone to look after millicas everyone can continue how they usually spend their daily life even if this boy is the next heir after me forget about that for his stay here and have fun during your daily life yes we gave an energetic reply to rias desire like that millicassamas observation started part 2 okay then we will be doing 1000 reps of knocks late at night at the riverbed xenovia was swinging a bat at a grasslot baseball ground yes coach the one who happily catches the ball hit away by xenovia is a youth who is wearing a baseball cap and uniform he is xenovias regular customer for her job millicassama and i were observing xenovia doing her job millicassama said
he wants to observe us doing our job so we decided to tag along with xenovia who had received a request i was millicassamas escort well he probably doesnt need one but im doing it just in case since there might be a problem if its only millicassama and xenovia i had finished my job and i tagged along because recently i became interested in xenovias way of doing her job as well the jobs xenovia receives involve her doing physical work most of the time amongst her requests are helping out with construction work and being a practice partner for different types of sports this time its the latter please do your best next to me and millicassama asia is cheering for xenovias client while wearing a cheerleaders uniform that boy who is the client asked for a cheerleader who will cheer for him along with a baseball partner for his practice so asia who didnt have any job at that time was called over as a helperasia looks very pretty in a cheerleaders outfit she was working really hard spinning around while breathing hard since its late at night in winter asiachan sure deserves praise requests asia receive
usually range from being an opponent at playing cards to wearing cosplay for a photo shoot konekochan also gets similar ones akenosans clients are either the bosses of companies or rich wives she listens to their daily worries or drinks tea with them so she has a huge range of work where she mostly takes away the stress of people living in high society kiba receives lots of jobs from oneesans and women who work they consult with their stresses they have in them or he cooks for them which he is good at its such a waste that he doesnt get any perverted requests gasper does it by using a computer he has his own way of working and shows topclass results he is really popular amongst those who are bad at interacting with others but have a wish they want to be granted by a devil rossweissesan gets summoned a lot by housewives she says she mainly teaches ways to ease their worries related to financial things and also becomes their consultant lately she has been teaching them surefire ways to win in bargain sales even though shes still young surprisingly the requests our master rias can get
are limited so she rarely gets one saying that the requirements rias has for her contract is very big and is worthy of a highclass devil her jobs include decursing items and defeating monsters targeting the client my job is i keep getting caught up in strange things after being summoned by weirdos i already gave up on the factor i have which attracts weirdos i already have strong foes coming to me but i also have weirdos and perverts coming to me as well thats why i cant show millicassama myself working i cant allow him to meet with weirdos and perverts he is sirzechssamas son if i introduce him to miltan as a start i wouldnt know what kind of rumours would spread in the underworld alright this time its 10000 knocks yessssss coooooachxenovia who is in really high spirits said something reckless to her client is the client who is exhausted still okay with continuing since he has a smile dont make him overdo it okay it would be a big problem if he died so wonderful i also want people in my group to enjoy their work like this millicassama said while looking at xenovia doing
her job xenovia sure does her job with a good smile millicassama do you have an ideal candidate in your mind for your group when i asked millicassama shook his head to the sides no that will start from now on though i do have a role model which i think is good well thats obvious even if he is intelligent and is looking ahead to his future it certainly would be hard to think of his future group in detail so will you be using rias group as a reference after all he has come here because he took an interest in our living style after all so thats what i thought but millicassama tilts his head its as though he isnt saying yes or no everyone in riasneesamas group are wonderful people iseniisama is also amazing and i admire you he said he admires me this really makes me happy but the group i have as my aim is tousamasfather group i see so its sirzechssamashis fathers group sirzechs lucifers group which is said to be the strongest in the underworld during the monster crisis i also saw them from afar once and i realised that they were
a bunch of strong people with overwhelming aura and atmosphere i sensed right away that they far surpass our team which has strong forces but also many weaknesses i heard that they only gather for a crisis in the underworld and for political reasons even so i would like to meet themonce the only ones i have met are grayfiasan and the pawn kirin enkusan while having my discussion with millicassama a girl wearing a gothic lolita costume appears within my sight its ophis yeah she said she had nothing to do so she tagged along with us to observe xenovias work since ophis started living in the hyoudou residence she has been following behind me and everyone else showing an interest in what we do when im playing a game she would say that she also wants to play when asia is watering the flowers she would help her and when rias stands in the kitchen ophis would stand beside her and watch her cook anyway she takes interest in what we are doing right now ophis is playing catch with asias familiar rasse ophis throws the ball and rasse catches it with its mouth splendidly and gives it
back to ophis maybe they get along because they are both dragons so they often play together i shall train rasse gaa the mini dragon responds to ophis training rasse the former uroborossama herself is going to train him hey hey hey what kind of masterstudent relation is this if ophis becomes his master wouldnt that mini dragon become a really powerful sprite dragon in the future it might be ophis way of joking but i started to have a vision that asias familiar will become a future dragon king maybe rasse will unexpectedly become an amazing dragon being ophis playing friend is quite the thing you know i said to asia who is next to me cheering for xenovias client if ophissan will teach him then rassekun will grow into a splendid dragon what an innocent girl asiachan is if asia is saying that then even i think it will turn out like thatasia you might have good ties with dragons not only rasse but the one who got along with ophis first was you asia when i said that asia starts to wriggle her body while having a red face that might be true i also met with
isesan who is the sekiryuutei and i was able to get along with you if i indeed have good connections like that then i can only give my thanks to the lord i received embarrassing words from her im also blessed for meeting asia we will always be together from now on as well yes whether it is a thousand years or tenthousand years i will always stay besides you isesan alright lets build a plan for thousands of years ahead with us living together then i like japan but i also want to live in the underworld once ok ok once i become independent i will take you anywhere we get heated up and hugged each other we then started to dance and spin around thats because asiachan is so cute while i was in a happymode with asia millicassama gave a suspicious look at ophis who is that girl in the black dress millicassama asked he was eyeing ophis with a strange look after all but we cant tell who ophis is hmm she is old man tannins relative or something she is using a technique to transform into a human and is learning about the lifestyle of
the human world i made up a story on the spot to answer his question i feel sorry for old man tannin but please make it so for this so thats what it was she is the same as me thenmillicassama believed in me i started to feel guilty because of his pure eyes and smile but this is for the sake of the whole world please believe in my lie then millicassama pulls my sleeve iseniisama please call me millicas even if you say that i feel it is rude i started to feel bewildered at millicassamas favour i already feel honoured for him calling me iseniisama but for me to call his name without sama is i called him with sama when we first met so its mainly for that reason i continued calling him like that i feel a bit lonely for someone who can call riasneesama rias calling my name with a sama millicassama started to look down i see he also wants me who calls his aunt he loves so much by her name to call him by his name i love rias and we have a relationship where we have told each other our
feelings she also accepted my feelings we love each other lovers is an embarrassing way to say it and it is suspicious if we are even acting as such but our feelings reached each other to me rias is an important woman she also takes importance in me as well this boy here knows that maybe that is why he also wants me to call his name normally just how i call rias name if i think about it rias once told me there are many of those who have high expectations of millicas since his birth is extremely special yes millicassama is the son born of the strongest maou sirzechs lucifer and the strongest queen grayfia lucifugus adding the fact about the extreme level of talent within him it seems there are adults who are keeping their eyes on him as a candidate for a future maou alreadythere is even a millicas faction among the politicians who are supporting sirzechssama and many devils are keeping their eyes on this boys future even though this boy is already thinking of his own future at this stage himself the politics also gets caught in it rias also feels proud of her
birth but she couldnt discard her dreams the dream of marrying the man she falls in love with but she had a fianc that troubled her and adults are trying to make this boys burden something even greater than that one day there will be a time when he will understand where he is standing i think he would feel proud but also struggle to go forward those are highclass devilsthe destinies of those with powerful parents i understand millica i stopped my words there thats because i just felt a chill someone is looking at me i could feel their gaze and i can sense a strong feeling being directed at me even if i look around there is no one in sight xenovia probably felt something too so she looked around the place as well ophis is also looking around asia millicassama and xenovias client havent realised it but at least we did someone is looking at me from somewhere far away thats how it felt xenovia asiasan i brought some sports drinks from the convenience store the one who came saying that while carrying a bag in one of her hands was irina sometimes irina observes asia
and xenovias jobs where she doesnt hinder them just like millicassama and i are doing now of course it would be heresy for an angel to directly help a devil thats why she is only observing well there are times where she brings refreshments justas she is doing now it seems that is on the border line of being safe a devil like myself doesnt understand that borderline they have oh the refreshments from the selfproclaimed angel have arrived im not selfproclaimed i am a real one irina puffed her cheeks at xenovias words hahaha seriously the combination of xenovia and irina does lighten up the atmosphere and if asia joins them it gets even lighter while feeling the uneasy presence millicassamas observation for that day ended part 3 the next day we were gathered in the training room located in the basement of the hyoudou residence i wore the boosted gear scale mail kiba gripped a sword and gasper was on standby behind us the one we the gremory boys will be facing ismillicassama millicassama who has changed into a jersey stands across from us with a brave expression despite being a child yes on this day what we
planned to get closer to millicassama isa mock battle this was rias idea millicas since this is a good opportunity do you want to spar with the boys hearing that millicassama responds energetically by saying yes please allow me it seems millicassama has an interest in the guts that the boys of the gremory group have and he has a good impression of sairaorgsans motto highclass devil who trains rias herself is in a corner of the training room with the rest of the occult research club girls and ophis they will be watching our mock battle the demonic sword kiba is holding is an imitation sword which has no blade he must have thought that it would be dangerous to use any type of sword holy sword or holy demonic sword with real blades on them im also in my armoured state i thought of fighting him with only my gauntlet but after rias told me you should wear your armour i ended upin this form was she trying to please millicassama by having him take on the legendary heavenly dragon aka the sekiryuutei gasper is behind us as a support member while not trembling despite having a nervous
expression ii will do my best oh do your best gasper since our opponent is a kid dont show him your weak side okay then let the mock battle begin with akenosans signal the mock battle started both kiba and i didnt move we are waiting for millicassama to make his move theres no way i can get serious after all we are far stronger than he is this isnt like a welcoming party for him but taking on millicassama while going easy on him until he is satisfied might be what i have to do millicassama makes his move as those thoughts crossed my mind here i come please take care of me he sprints from his position i was speechless after seeing millicassama make his move hes fast he came with speed which isnt that of a child after covering his hand in red aura he shoots the demonic power at me after making a few feints the attack which was released by the boy is the same power of destruction that his father and aunt possess i cant believe it his demonic power is more powerful than i thought i evaded the demonic power which is coming
at me leaving kiba in its path kiba barely dodged it and blocks it with his demonic sword bashualong with the sound of an object being grazed the edge of kibas demonic swordhas been eliminated kiba is shocked at this im also shocked deeply from my heart that attack had quite a huge amount of aura kibas demonic sword wasnt made that strong because it was for use in a mock battle but for him to be able to destroy it hey hes quite the thing yyeah im also surprised its the exact same demonicpower as oneesamas xenovia irina and asia were shocked at the boys demonic power the flow of his aura was smooth thats definitely not something that he should be capable of at his age to eliminate yuutosenpais sword without a trace i did hear rumours about it but seeing it with my own eyes i can sense strongly that he is the son of that sirzechssama and grayfiasama rossweissesan konekochan and ravel also changed their opinions all the female members of the occult research club besides rias and akenosan were shocked at this scene aye millicassama shortens the distance while we were shocked and shoots out
his demonic power this time he shot the demonic power like a shotgun many bullets of power of destruction come at us you get erased by the power of destruction just by touching it it has an unimaginable characteristic which is very hard to block against rias demonic power is also deadly if it hits although she ends up encountering those she cant directly hit with it the best way to counter the power of destruction is not blocking it directly but killing it off with our own attack i created a scatter type dragonshot and shot it forwardwhen the shots were about to cancel each other out by colliding many shots millicassama released changed their direction its exactly like sirzechssamas demonic power the exquisite skill of sirzechssama where he compresses the powerful power of destruction into a sphere and controls it millicassamas control of his demonic power reminded me of that i dodged the attacks of demonic power from the crimson haired boy which went through my counter attack but one of them grazes my armour bashun along with the sound the shoulder part of my armour was erased a bit if i didnt have my armour my shoulder
would have been erased i finally understood the reason rias told me to wear my armour thats because i might not be able to take on millicassama if i didnt have anything on me the boy who is on a different level no wonder hes the son of sirzechssama and grayfiasan he has this much strength at this age right now we are far superior by the time he is our age i wonder how powerful he will be i cant imagine it thats how much limitless potential i felt from him the last time i was pushed back by an extreme talent like this was vali i can understand why factions were formed within the politicians who supports millicassama when i looked towards rias she nodded her head while smiling knowingly she must know what is on my mind seriously im sorry for looking down on him my opponent turns out to be a monstrous boy but thanks to that i had a wake up call i will continue this mock battle while knowing that my opponent is a boy who is in his own league the guts of the gremory boys i will smack them into you i
said that while putting my fist forward and millicassama showed me a big smileyes please do i started to get heated up in a mock battle against this boy the boy who calls me niisama is coming at me with all his strength is this how it feels like to compete against a younger brother i have never felt something like that since i dont have any siblings but i thought that this connection with millicassama might be something close to it haahaahaa millicassama who is sitting on the floor is breathing hard he is really exhausted the mock battle went on for thirty minutes even if three of us the boys went easy on him i can only say as expected from the son of a maou since he was able to follow us for thirty minutes millicassama continued to attack us until he ran out of his demonic power no matter how many times he was pushed down by me and kiba he stood up without crying i can only say splendid from what i saw of him during our mock battle if i was the same age as millicassama i would cry and give up in a
onesided match against three older guys or i would complain about it if i think like that then this boys guts is strong i fended his attacks while giving him advice which he responded to that right away and i saw his talent when he made his stance i can only say one word scary rias hands a towel to millicassama who is on the floor you did well for not giving up while taking on ise and the others he was praised by rias of course we took him on where he might cry a bit i thought it would have been rude if we went too easy on him it seems children are very sensitive to those things after i deactivated my armour and received a towel from rias i left the training room after saying i will wash my face i washed my face at the sink located in the big bathroom it was funit must feel like that to play around with your cute younger brother when he came at me he looked brave and i had a heart beat which went kyuun something like a fathers love toward his child was building inside me a
brotheror maybe a son is okay then i cant actually have a proper feeling of having a child im still a high school student and i cant even imagine it but lately something is building inside me after seeing ophis who has the appearance of a child and millicassama spending time with kids might not be bad i muttered ufufu you are right akenosan was suddenly standing behind me akenosan havent you become good at standing behind others without leaving any presence lately akenosan then says while handing me a bottle with sports drink inside it lately ive been having a thought thought yes a boy and a girl both would be okay my feelings get even stronger when i look at ophischan and millicaskun yeah millicassama is a good boy and i also dont get bored of ophis since she has the cuteness of a small animal these are my true feelings their presence is a good stimulus for me ophis doesnt have a gender before she was a geezer and even before that she was something else apparently she always changed appearances but right now she is a girl we also interact with ophis as if she is
a girl isekun when you get married in the future would you prefer a boy or a girl thats a hard question my dream will be fulfilled if i have twins and they are a boy and a girl but it seems like taking care of them will be twice as hardfirst a boy then having a girl might be ideal as i thought that akenosan started smiling while patting her stomach if it is your child then i will bear as many as you want bebecause of her stimulating words i started to get a nosebleed and began to cough out the sports drink in my mouth cough i coughed out the drink at the unexpected confession and couldnt respond to her im such a weak guy ara ara i ended up having akenosan stroke my back uggh im so pathetic the reason my face is red isnt only because im in pain after coughing it was then that i felt a huge wild aura behind me when i turned around a huge man who is more than two meters tall was standing at the entrance of the bathroom his orange hair was spiked up and his thick coat
was standing out wait who is he why is he in the hyoudou residence the giant man smiles at me and akenosan oh oh sekiryuutei is coughing in the bathroom what kind of situation is this no the question is who are you second you do know that going into the bathroom without permission is rude i couldnt talk back because of the cough along with the huge man two other men i havent seen before have appeared as well one of the men is wearing a crimson robe with a distinguished design and the other man appears to be japanese wearing a haori the one who reprimanded the huge man just now was the man wearing the haorirather im familiar with this person i had a glimpse of him during the monster chaos in the underworld the other day akenosan was shocked at the appearance of the men her shock isnt because people she doesnt know appeared but that of why are these people who are known to her here she had that kind of face akenosan then says quietly they are people from lucifers group yes it was a sudden visit from some amazing people akenosan and i
returned to the training room bringing the three people that appeared in the bathroom with us the one who was the most shocked at this was rias and she screamed hysterically souji so everyone came here the man wearing a haori called souji smiled softly hime6 it has been a while yes i thought i should escort millicassama the man called souji then moves his eyes towards kiba im glad that you are doing well yuuto kiba bows and fixes his posture its been a while since summer master yes this man wearing the haori is sirzechssamas servant the knight okita soujisan he is the real captain of the first division of the shinsengumi hhe is a historical person even a dumb person like me knows about the shinsengumi someone who is super famous is among sirzechssamas group and he happens to be kibas swordmaster how should i say iti can only say one word amazing he is tying his hair at the back like a samuraiwell he is a samurai his appearance is that of someone in his late twenties though his real age is over a hundred years i asked kiba about this person after the monster crisis
then he told me the details about his master i kept on being shocked about itit seems there are cases where devils in upper society have a historical person as their servant the reincarnated devils are those from when chess was createdmainly the historical people are those from when chess started chess appeared in human history then the evilpieces were created so the reincarnated ones are those from that time until now so which other famous people became a devil i cant even imagine hahahahaha its been a while himesan the one who is laughing loudly is the huge man the wild aura covering his body feels as though it surpasses that of sairaorgsan his body is also one fold bigger than sairaorgsan his hands are insanely large they are so big that he can hold my whole head in one of them you are being rude to hime riashime it really has been a while you have become even more beautiful the one who makes his bow while reprimanding the huge man is wearing a crimson coloured robe he is skinny and he has sharp eyes unlike the wild aura around the huge man he has a limitless creepy
aura coming from his body its certain that they are strong people who have powers i cant possibly calculate so second and macgregor also came i wonder what is the reason for oniisamas servants to come here all of you dont gather together unless it is an emergency even if you are here as millicas guards this is too much rias opinion sounds accurate why did they gather at my house i understand why they gathered at the monster crisis which was an emergency in the underworld but why did the strongest group the lucifers group come to my house all of a sudden the huge man gulps the bottle of sake in his hand at once the sake bottle looks like a mini toy the man breathes out fire from his nose once he finished drinking it he breathed out fire along with his breath nothing much we just thought we should go somewhere with everyone so we came to see how himesama was doing along with guardingbocchan7 though we couldnt bring that bastard enku and bahamoot 8 they gathered here just for a reason like that they came to visit the hyoudou residence to see rias while guarding
millicassama hhmm i dont understand the reason for the strongest group to visit my house at all so is the reason for them to gather at my house related to politics even so im amazed i havent seen these three together since i was really little said rias is that true then it means we are experiencing a rare situation then i am also surprised since this is my first time meeting everyone together you too akenosan uwaah today really is an amazing day being puzzled we just stood there stunned all the occult research members besides rias and akenosan didnt know what to do i will introduce them to all of you then rias realised that we were shocked by these unexpected and unknown visitors so their introductions began first it was the man wearing haoriokitasan he is my brothers only knight okita souji he is also yuutos sword master all of you also know him from the shinsengumi correct irina is shocked at rias introduction of him yyes so you are a historical personright okitasan smiles at irinas shocked voice yes that is correct at that time i left the battlefield due to my disease and to avoid
dying from tuberculosis i lay my hands on various rituals by chance or a miracle i ended up summoning that person sirzechssama back then he was in the form of a black cat so there was a contract like that behind the history that we know of the episode between okitasan and the black cat is famous is that for real sirzechssamawhen he kept on repeating his rituals soujisans body became the home of monsters the man wearing the robe gave me extra information then from behind okitasana huge monster appeared which has the face of a monkey the limbs of a tiger and a snake as its tail a mixed monster a chimera okitasan pats the monsters head this is a youkai called nue it might be quicker if i say it is a japanese version of a chimera due to the rituals many youkai started living in my body so i was able to perform a hitori hyakki yakkou9 so many youkai like that are living in okitasans house hyakki yakkou just what kind of state is that thats why he probably needed two knight pieces the ones who were fighting the antimonsters created from jabberwocky were soujisans
youkais the man wearing the robe explained since he is a hitori hyakki yakkou he needed two of sirzechssamas knight pieces the question is how many dozens worth of peoples work he can perform the point where he can fight all of the antimonsters created from jabberwocky makes him insane in many ways his skill with using swords is so great that you probably need to put several words of super your sword skills right so that means kibas master is on a different level the things i learned from master were the way to use swords and fighting posture rather than his swordsmanship style so my swordsmanship style isnt completely that of tennen rishinryu10 kiba explained certainly kibas sword style isnt that of a samurai rias then moves the introductions along next i will introduce oniisamas bishop after okitasans introduction ended the man wearing a robe who has been explaining everything to us nods to us his movements were filled with elegancehis age also appears to be that of someone in his late twenties just like okitasan the long silts of his eyes and his shallow smile make him look bewitching his hair which is a mixture of black
and blonde is long and slightly wavy macgregors full name is macgregor mathers he is a user of modern western magic and he is one of the founders of the hermetic order of the golden dawn i think he is also famous for compiling and translating the book about the 72 pillars golden dawn i tilted my head at the words i never heard of before but xenovia irina and asia seems very shocked he is the expert at magic related things aamazing i was taught about him back in the church yes for people using magic he is very famous the shocked state of these three wasnt the same as when we were told of okitasan the man wearing the robe macgregorsan smiles at my reaction fufu hime it seems waka doesnt know about me11 i dont mind its okay if you recognise me merely as an amazing magician iis that so but i dont think you are just a mere amazing magician at the point where you are sirzechssamas bishop who consumed two pieces you are not an ordinary magician thats right akenosan since he was fighting that jabberwocky using his magic he must be on a totally
different level i would like to talk to you about magic one day it seems rossweissesan has great interest in macgregorsan she must want to learn about magic from him as a magic user and the last one to be introduced isthe huge man he takes a step forward with a loud laugh gahaha he says loudly while pointing at himself with his thumbnow its my turn i am one of the rook of boss sirzechs surtr secondsama now fight me kneel before me as if gahahahahaha he really acts how he looks like his appearance he does make me feel great temperament coming from him he appears to be in his midthirties with a good body build rias also introduces him while smiling he is a copy of the fire giant surtr from norse mythology the surtr who is said to have lit the world tree yggdrasil on fire while bringing an army of giants with him surtr huh i only know his name after the battle against loki i touched the books about norse mythology a bit after taking an interest in themand i think i saw that name appear the fire giant so thats why he has
a huge body and he breathed out fire before huh he is a copy of that legendary being if he is a copy does that means he is a clone its one of those things which uses the same cells and stuff right is it okay to think of him like that the norse gods were somehow able to make a copy of surtr but the copy started to go berserk the bishop macgregorsan explains this person really likes to explain maybe he just likes to talk macgregorsan continues they discarded him because they couldnt control him sirzechssama appeared and made him his servant using a mutation rook piece since he is a copy he was given the name second mutation piece on top of that he is sirzechssamas rook which is a mutation piece i cant measure just how much surtr is worth but he is the rook of that sirzechssamaworth 5 pawns and on top of that a mutation piece was used just how much potential power does he hold how many pawns would he be worth if they calculate in the rating game methodi was completely shocked about it but the giant surtr secondsan speaks after making
a sigh and breathing out fire yeah i was abandoned by those shits from the norse and boss sirzechs saved me when i was burning with my own flames thanks to that i learnt how to use my fire completely and i was able to follow the boss as the strongest rook in the underworld sirzechssama sure did pick up someone awe inspiring so he saved an amazing copy who was abandoned by the norse gods surtr seconds expression and words included his respect towards his master sirzechssama who saved his life so grayfiasan is the strongest queen and this huge man is the strongest rook its becoming so big that my head is about to explode but the bishop macgregor puts on a bitter smile the socalled strongest rooksama turned into a giant at the start of the battle against jabberwocky used his serious fire and wasted it losing all of his energy and couldnt participate in the last battle geez that jabberwocky was an antimonster on a totally different level for devils and it was also explained that it had powerful regeneration beforehand we wouldnt have had to waste that much time defeating it if we took him
on after we received ajukasamas antispells for it your fire is so powerful that it can burn everything if you use it to the fullest you know well if you dont fail that is he started to make a whole host of sarcastic comments hearing that surtr secondsan approached macgregorsan shut up you always say too much macgregor doing something when i can makes me the rook of boss sirzechs bahamoot who is the same rook was more useful at both the start and the end of the battle it was wiping out the small antimonsters together with soujisans youkais the name bahamoot which appeared in macgregorsans sentences i have heard about it before its a legendary monster which glows in a light right not only can it swim in the ocean but i heard it is a giant fish which can also swim in the sky that fish monster is also part of sirzechssamas group and is his rook huhi have told you many times not to put me in the same category as that fish surtr secondsan grabbed macgregorsans collar while being enraged macgregorsan doesnt care and smiles at us while finishing his explanation and so these are
the members yes yeyeah i see so these are the members so the lucfier group is completed when grayfiasan and enkusan joins them here huh thats what i thought but rias looks around as if she is searching for someone by the way where is beowulf so only three of you came today hearing that name okitasan surtr secondsan and macgregorsan stood there still then all of them said oh yeah as if they just remembered something ah that guy is before surtr secondsan could continue the door of the training room was opened wide and echoed throughout the basement the one who appeared while everyone was looking at him wasa man with brown hair who was breathing heavily he looks like he is in his mid twenties and he is wearing a suit ii finally caught up the man takes a breath while putting his hand on the wall seeing that surtr secondsan mutters youre late beo what are you saying secondsan you were the one telling me to carry this and that the one who transported all the souvenirs bought in japan to the underworld was me the man called beo who seems dissatisfied was pointed at by
macgregorsan and he started to give his explanationhe is the other pawn of sirzechssamabeowulf he is the descendant of the hero beowulf and lost completely against sirzechssama after he challenged him to a fight he then asked if he could become his servant the descendant of a hero so sirzechssama also made someone like that into his servant the man wearing a suit who was just introduced called beowulf tilts his head at the atmosphere in the room and then opens his mouth huh my introductionrather did everyone give their introduction to waka already since you were late we finished it just now wearing a suit man you are so annoying beowulfsan protests with teary eyes to surtr secondsan what i told you to wait for my introduction i was trying to think of something cool to say to waka since i am a senior pawn you know i even prepared a new suit since the first impression is the most important surtr secondsan ignores beowulfsan seeing him up close he really is a giant what intensity he then tells me oh waka he is our lackey waka you can also use him all you want you know wakais he
referring to me people related to the gremory sometimes calls me waka wait a lackey iis it okay to treat him like that hearing that beowulfsan is shocked youre horrible you dont tell anything to enku who is also sirzechssamas pawn you only tell me to do something impossible the pawnsama who has lots of dissatisfaction rias makes a small laugh and then tells me beowulf looks like hes easygoing but hes famous for being one of the top5 pawns in the underworld he is oniisamas pawn after all hes a strong foe who you can not judge by his appearance after all before reincarnating he wounded oniisama in a oneonone battlehe is among the top5 pawns so he is quite a skilled person then on top of that he is a descendant of a hero is it possible for a man like him who shows such a pathetic side to have the strength of cao cao wounding that sirzechssama is something huge he just made a tiny cut on his arm after that he was battered into pieces right because of macgregorsans unnecessary words beowulfsan gets teary eyes again man himesama was saying good stuff about me for those
who are seeing me for the first time their image of me will be the worst he seems to be an amusing pawnsan so in sirzechssamas group there is a person like him who has high tension and who gets picked on huh so sirzechssamas pawns are enkusan and beowulfsan rias nods at my question hmm so there are only two pawns the queen grayfiaoneesama the rooks surtr second and bahamoot the bishop macgregor the knight souji the pawns enku and beowulf they are oniisamas servants i see so these are almost all the members of the lucifer group yeah thats right if it is about pawns then just ask me i will answer anything you want wakagimi12 beowulfsan who got his spirit back tells me confidently ah yes i will ask when the time comes i replied hearing that surtr secondsan and macgregorsan started laughing you were ignored so simply as we thought it wont be good with beo gahahahahaha surtr secondsan started laughing out loud and beowulfsan started shivering because of enduring the embarrassment huh should i have replied with something better to me that was the best way to reply even if they drag me into this
i will also be troubledi beg you beowulfsan osu should i have replied like that okitasan makes a cough to fix the atmosphere and he then asks rias by the way has sirzechssama come here no he hasnt did something happen hearing that the four members of lucifer group looked at each other as if there is something going on okitasan continues the truth is there is a flashback to the not too distant past sirzechssama who was enjoying his fatherandson time with millicassama suddenly asked his son i may be able to take a day off millicas do you want to play satan red with me satan red of the maou squadron satan rangers who is sirzechssama enjoys playing with his son more than anything his son millicas replied no tousama on the next day off im going to riasneesamas place under iseniisama and everyone else i will be observing the living style of the devils in japan sirzechssama appeared to be very happy about it he praised his sons desire but for the answer to the next question sirzechssama yes that is a very significant thing by the way millicas satan red and oppai dragon which one do
you prefer i would have to say oppai dragon the armour with so many variations looks really amazing i also think the toys are very good i easily imagined the scene where millicassama replied energetically and sirzechssama freezes with a forced smilesince millicassama started staying here sirzechssama goes out every time he has time off apparently today he also used the time off to go outside the members of sirzechs group thought maybe sirzechssama came here but the maousama himself is nowhere to be seen chills i then had chills again the sensation that i am being watched and can sense intense feelings being aimed at me when i looked aroundi caught sight of something unnatural from the door of the training room which is slightly opened someone in a tokusatsu hero costume was gazing at me and im familiar with that appearance of course the one who was looking at me from the door wassatan red thats sirzechssamaaaaaaa and this chilling feeling its the same one i felt at the baseball ground next to the river dont tell me i was being watched by satan red back then as well millicasso you like oppai dragon more than satan red
his voice and existence were filled with sadness oooooooi the maousama is sad while in the shadows and wearing a tokusatsu heros costume rias who is already aware of the identity of satan red whispers in my ear he must be thinking that millicas was taken by you ise geez rias was also troubled by her brothers condition i see so that feeling of being watched wasnt that of hostility but of a jealous father gazing at me because i was getting along with millicassama and that is while wearing satan reds costume so you were watching the sight of your adorable son speaking to the oppai dragon with sad eyes from afar during your time off surtr secondsan approaches sirzechssama and tells himboss there is only a choice of deciding who is the one at the top against oppai dragon you know at this rate you will have bocchan taken away by chichiryuutei please dont tell him weird things please dont make it worse master sirzechs this might be the time where you have to decide it in front of millicassama i think you have to show that the grandness of a father is greater than the grandness of
breasts even macgregorsama is saying weird things to his master also what is this greatness between the grandness of a father over grandness of breasts please give me a break i dont want to fight satan red again iseniisama my father would be your opponent but please do your best so will the battle between me and satan red happen again here whilst i was terrified at the prospecta light is drawn at the centre of the room and it creates a circle its a magic circle and it is one that i know this isthe symbol of gremory this timing and this magic circle if that is the case then it must be that person the light flashes and the one who appeared from the magic circle is the silverhaired maid its grayfiasaaaaaaaaan i started to shed tears of joy at the arrival of my saviour who can also be thought of as my goddess at the appearance of grayfiasan all of the lucifer group froze and their faces became blue the one who hasnt changed much is okitasan who is still smiling even satan reds body is shivering at the appearance of the strongest queen grayfiasan looks around
the room she looks at us the gremory group then looks at the lucifer group with cold eyes and lastly she catches sight of maou she takes a step forward the grand huge body of surtr secondsan twitches what is the proud lucifer group doing in a place like thisher words have intensity in them even if it isnt directed at us its scary its too scary asia has teary eyes and even xenovia has a stiff expression beowulf approaches grayfiasan and starts to give an excuse tthis is anesan13 we thought we should gather together as a group and have some good times grayfiasan directs her eyes filled with intensity at him yes i am very sorry please punish me how ever you see fit beowulfsan knelt down and apologised man he is fast at changing damn you beo you lost so easily boss lady coming to himesans place to greet her should be fine and also for being bocchans guards the huge man surtr second started to give his excuses but if you are going then tell me first going to peoples houses without their confirmation is rude this is the hyoudou residence not the house of gremory
also it is enough for riasojousama and isesan to be millicassamas guards at her response he cant talk back surtr secondsan can only stay silent lastly grayfiasan looks at sirzechssama sirzechssama for you to come to this town dressed like that while taking time off please give me a good explanation for it grayfiasan now has some anger in her voice satan red comes forward as if he made up his mind and stands across from grayfiasanhe then kneels down im sorry it is my fault he lost the strongest maoulost to his wife i knew about it but still this is did you know kaasama is the strongest millicassama has a big smile yup everyone nodded their heads at his wordswe went to see off grayfiasan who is taking sirzechssama with her so then everyone i will continue to leave millicassamas guard under your care millicassama please make sure not to trouble everyone until your return the day after tomorrow okay okay grayfiasan finally smiled after seeing her sons reply energetically that was the face of amother after sending off grayfiasan who disappeared within the lights of the magic circle the only ones remaining were the lucifer group to
these people grayfiasan said all of you are important people in the underworld so please return together with millicassama so they were allowed to stay here for a bit after that the members of the lucifer group decided to enjoy japan while staying at a hotel in this town we enjoyed ourselves with millicassama until the last moment of his stay we ate japanese food together and we went shopping at the department store together i felt that he was the same as kids of his age when he was being hyped about toys he received a special lesson about 100 yen shops from rossweissesan and it appears he quite enjoyed himself during his stay we had a bath together its what you call a naked relation between men and so on the day of our parting the members of lucifer group came to pick him up before giving our farewells the huge man surtr second called me over using his hand next to us kiba was speaking with okitasan oi sekiryuutei yyes what is it when i approached him timidly surtr secondsan activates a small magiccircle on his palm and he makes something appear from there i want to
introduce something good to youthe thing which appeared in surtr secondsans palm issomething which looks like a toy sailing ship it has a different form and design to airships and aeroplanes but it looked like one of those ships which appear in a fantasy rpg wwhat is this thing that looks like a radiocontrolled toy yes it seems like a radiocontrolled device and has lots of detail but i can only think of this as a toy but the sailing ship starts to move by itself in the air it didnt seem like surtr secondsan moved it using his demonic power rather i should say it seemed like it moved by itself as if he understood what went through my mind surtr secondsan smiles this is a flying magical sailing ship spoken of in the norse world called skithblathnir it is also called a living sailing ship it is a masterpiece created by the valdi tribe who also created the mjlnir for thor this is one of the boats i obtained this under certain requirements you know its quite rare after all there are only a countable number of them in this world a living airship amazing so there are
also things like this the magical sailing ship which came from norse mythology its still a small sailing ship and its like a toy this thing is famous for evolving into different things by using the aura of its master as its source how about it dont you want to take this as your familiar i also became shocked at the unexpected offer i make this my familiar ffamiliaryou say thissailing ship yeah if its okay with you i will let you have it this is a present from me after all you use your own body to fight for the underworld and boss sirzechs its obvious for you to at least take this iif im allowed to take it then yes please after all i still dont have a familiar yeah i still dont have a familiar the reason is because i couldnt find the time and also because i was still dragging the thing about surataro and shokushumaruright now when a familiar is necessary rias is supporting me so will this turn into a huge airship when it grows when i asked the bishop macgregorsan answers me from the side yes it would also the appearance after its
growth will depend on its masters aura and their imagination with you who is the sekiryuutei taking in unexpected growth and imagination it might turn into a plane which hasnt existed until now surtr secondsan says it while making a loud laugh more like you can use it for that the story is you can make it into a flying harem palace you are aiming to make a harem right then you will need a harem palace so that is where this comes in with how you use it you can make it into your flying harem palace how is it are you excited a flying harem palace so there are things like that i never saw it like that rather i didnt even imagine it like that thats right if im aiming to become a harem king then i will have to prepare a harem palace and if its a flying harem palace thatll be the best fufufu putting the palace aside it will also become a good thing for transporting in the future even in this state it can still fly while carrying you who is its master macgregorsan says a harem palace which can also be used
as transportation man this will be invincible then i will happily take this i was emotionally moved and i accepted his kindness this is good this is great a living flying harem palace gufufu i will make it into a harem palace of my liking i sure cant stop thinking about it we were having such a conversation but the time for parting with millicassama finally came thanks for taking care of me i enjoyed it very much can i come here to play againat millicassamas question everyone nodded their head and responded by saying come again with a smile seeing that the crimsonhaired boy showed an adorable smile come here again everyone thinks of you as their little brother millicas next time maybe we should go to kyoto together with everyone millicassama also nodded his head energetically at rias words and said yeah so then everyone i will be looking forward to our next meeting bowing his head millicassama leaves together with the lucifer group after giving his farewell politely i yeah i should say it that boysought that from me so then i i took a deep breath and released a huge voice millicas come again i called
the crimsonhaired boy as he had desired while putting my thumb up and gave my farewell to him with a smile iseniisama please play with me again millicassama made a brighter face at the end our little brothermillicas gremory things like the sudden visit from the lucifer group and the attack of satan red happenedbut i want to have a fun daily life with that boy againafterword it has been a while i think it has become a compilation of short stories which went freestyle once again now then here is the introduction to each short story a tokusatsu devil timeline after volume 5 the story about the show serafall is broadcasting in the underworld magicalleviatan since it was a story before the coming of oppai dragon i edited while feeling nostalgic it is a rare story where gasper also had the spotlight as the key character if i think about it maybe gaspers mysterious power has been released since this story ise sos timeline after volume 5 in terms of the story it happened right after the a tokusatsu devil it can also be said that it happened right before volume 6 this is the celebration short story since
dragon magazine had dxd as the cover when this short story appeared abesenpai the monstertamer who has appeared in the main story appeared once again not only the snow gorilla but also a tuna with legs and nagoyakochin also appeared by the way the real beautiful mermaid appeared in a different short story when i have a chance im thinking of it being published on the compilation of short stories the disturbance of a devil timeline after volume 7 rossweissesan has finally joined thats what i thought but it seemed like it was a short story where kiba became the key character kiba cant appear on the dxd cover because he is a man if that is the case then wont he be able to appear if he turns into a girl i wrote this story with that being the trigger for it since he is handsome he turns into a beautiful girl when he changes into a woman on top of that he has huge oppai by the way there was a short story where the girls turned into handsome guys you can say that it was a story before this one unfortunately it wasnt compiled in this the
unresurrected phoenix timeline after volume 8the raiser resurrection story which has been mentioned several times in the main story raiser who lost to ise and having rias taken away it was a trace story until raisers recovery well it means he recovered because he was also a big pervert a yakitori who is somewhat a bit popular from the readers armageddon at sports day timeline after volume 8 i have written quite a number of short stories until now but this is one of the story which is among the top in terms of chaos michael and others from heaven made a rare appearance i added the part of uriels appearance for this short story compilation i will make raphael appear for a bit when i see the time the biggest swirl of this story was about azazel who had a black history behind him the majority of the artificial sacred gears came from his 8th grade syndrome the worry of the nextnext heirsama timeline after volume 12 a new written story the timeline for it is after volume 12 and it is a completely new story while having millicas who is the son of sirzechs and grayfia in the
spotlight i wrote about the peaceful hyoudou residence after what happened in volume 12 it was stated in the story but in terms of talent millicaskun has the best potential by far in this series most likely by the time he becomes the same age as ise and others he would turn out into an incredible devil what can i say since people around him are incredible people like his mom and dad and ise who would become his uncle planned so the environment he is living in is insane i dont know after how many years it will be but after dxd ends i am having an imagination of wanting to write a story about him who is all grown up as the main character attending the school in the underworld i have explained about the brave saints for the first time in this series the main card games is used as its system not only poker and blackjack but maybe it has a trait of other major card games from the card settings there might be those who are wondering about the existence of the other trump cardthe extra joker i will explain about that in the next
occasion so please wait for it while not holding too much anticipation for it now for the lucifer groupthe members of the lucifer group have finally made their appearance i received so many words about people wanting me to make them appear so i made them appear in the new written story for this short story compilation they are all monstrously strong the amazing members are the queen grayfia the rook surtr second mutation piece the rook glowing fish of the deep sea bahamoot the knight okita souji the bishop macgregor matthers the pawn enku and the pawn beowulf unexpectedly there isnt a single person who has a sacred gear i think there are those who are unsure of beowulfs strength since he made a pathetic appearance but that guy has quite the strength as a descendant of a hero thinking that he doesnt have a sacred gear he still has shocking strength he has a fame as a support type and he unleashes his true strength when he does a combination with other group members well more than that surtr second has unreal specs if he had fought properly jabberwocky would have been defeated immediately it is the truth
that he is the strongest rook bahamoot mainly does things like searching for the enemy being used as a transport method for the group and to wipe the grunts it is also insanely strong by itself macgregor is in the prohibitedclass for each type of magic white black norse summon and seirei and he is the leading person in the research for the forbiddentechniques now for my own reflections i made lately i tend to forget to explain the details of the setting during the story when i think a lot about it and as a result there are many cases where i get troubled by it for example i should have explained about how kiba was able to create the holy sword much earlier i had it as a setting much earlier but since his holy demonic sword is more powerful than the holy sword he can create there wasnt a scene where i could make it in action and also lately about akras strength in volume 12 i wrote that he has the power that is equal to the whole yondaimaou together but i received several questions from readers who read this and asked me is that the
comparison when you include sirzechs in his true form the true sirzechs and the serious ajuka who havent appeared in the story isnt included in the comparison if akra is stronger than the yondaimaou when you include sirzechs true formrm then the power influenza will be go offso thats about it for the introduction of each story and my reflections unfortunately there were several stories which werent included the story about how the church trio goes to akihabara and gets culture shock and the story about ise losing his pervertness by being hit by a laser from a mysterious ufo now from here is about my poor writing skills for this volume i received 12 pages to do my afterword so im thinking of filling it up when it becomes a bluray bundled volume there is a chosen page numbers allowed for both the limited and normal edition so it cant be neither too short or long since the story didnt have that much pages this time the afterword became longer instead now for the first part growth change its about those things when i compare the short stories which were published in the beginning and the ones i am
writing now you can see quite the differences i read a tokusatsu devil and ise sos once again because it would be included in this volume andi was shocked that there were so many lacking descriptions and sentences instead my writing style changed from the disturbance of a devil i have changed and altered many things but maybe all of you havent noticed it but as the author i am shocked at my own change is this growth or is it a change even my editorsan in charge said lately the way you write has settled down or rather you became used to writing i dont think im that goodbut maybe i have gotten quite better than before second point regarding the anime because of quite the support of the fans it became quite a popular hit not just the light novel team but all of the anime staff were also shocked i thank you very much for the support since when it was decided to get an anime the light novel team miyamasan the editorsan in charge and i had many things we needed to do so i wrote many things related to dxd that is still continuing while
i am writing this afterword instead i am in a busy situation since i got my work to do after the anime endedabout the time during anime production it was something i feel very honoured about but i also participated in the anime planning a meeting related to the script things related to series meeting every week the meeting was always peaceful at the beginning and the end and i was shocked about how much the staff understood the light novel i really was blessed with a good staff i was lucky i was also allowed to do a check on storyboard and i was asked to speak my opinion about whether it is good or bad by comparing it with the light novel i really cant express my gratitude since the all of the staff took in the opinion of me the author the anime production was while getting the fans of the light novel and also getting new fans as a result it was fortunate that it satisfied many fans of this light novel and there were many of those who started reading this because of the anime most likely more than half of the readers are those
who started reading it because of the anime thats how much effect the anime had and my job was also to write the script of the drama cd and the special novel for the bluray and dvd main story short story drama cd script checking animerelated things special novels for the bluraydvd checking animerelated things script for the drama cd a bit of my comment a bit of comment and check checking animerelated things main story short story script for the drama cd checking the animerelated things special novels for the bluraydvd short story checking animerelated things shortshort etcetc that was the state i was in even now i am having a lifestyle where i am writing things related to dxd i dont even know how many times i typed the word oppai the truth is i was in charge of couple of the anime pv it was fun third point the characters popularity before i said that ises popularity is ranked 3rd in the afterword but right now the one ranked first is the main heroine rias the anime had a major influence on it and before the airing of the anime akeno was ranked 1st and rias was
ranked 2nd but the anime concentrated on rias so rias progressed to the most popular it seems like it is very rare thing for the main heroine to become the most popular in a harem genre like this andthat also proves how much rias is loved by the readers so thank you very much she is the king the mother and the big sister of the group and she is also the switch princess maybe she was able to gain popularity easily because she has many roles and because she is the one leading the group so like that the top 3 popular characters are rias akeno and then ise rather the early members have high popularity what is more shocking is that the male characters are also popular fourth point the parts i am fixing the wrong words and the missing words which was due to the timeline has been fixed the biggest one i made is on the first publishment of volume 5 which is about the ring in ises wrist normally the flow of the story would have been smooth if the ring was on his left wrist which is the hand with the gauntlet but i
typed in right wrist as a result i troubled miyamazerosan and made the ring appear on his right wrist on the illustration this is completely my mistake i am very sorry the republished prints of the book should have been fixed to the wrist the other one i was notified by the other readers are the part where azazel explained about ddraig is worth 79 and ise is worth 01 you cant understand it right i fixed it to 79 chess pieces and also about the the miko from the temple in other volumes it is written as the miko from the shrine but only that part has it as the miko from the temple there are no mikos in a temple i also fixed this in the latest print i am also fixing other parts so everyone please try finding the parts which has been fixed fifth point the questions i receive a lot from the readers i received many support letters and questions from the readers so i am thinking of answering several of those asked often here the question i received a lot is this one who would be among the top 10 strongest in the world
that vali was speaking about in volume 4 it was even written in the message that the fans are also debating about this seems like everyone are interested in it i do have the setting of itjust in case so i will announce it here of course it is a dxd original ranking in no particular order ophis shiva vishnu brahma akra thor typhon or fenrir hades aten and lugh thats how it is great red isnt included because it is a creature who basically doesnt fight i get many claim that this isnt true and it is the ranking before ophis and fenrir lost their powers what you will have to pay attention to are the hindu mythology which hasnt appeared in the series yet well those who know about their mythology know it but the hindu gods all have cheatlike abilities if i make them appear in dxd it will turn out like the battle in dragon ball so i controlled myself the hindu mythology will be placed in the higher ranks of the top10 strongest that vali spoked about it truly is terrifying if dxd continues to go on for much longer im thinking of doing the
destruction god shiva arc as a last resort so i have no plan to make them appear until then by the way the true sirzechs and the serious ajuka will be placed among the ranks the question i received the second most will kunou and other girls that have appeared become ises servant those girls who are not allowed to become a devil due to their position probably wont kunou is the princess of the youkai faction in the kyoto there is no way that she can become a devil but i think they can become his girlfriends even without becoming his servants you know there are things like local wives after all now for the thanks miyamasama supervisorhsama i really have been under your cares also including the releases of the short stories all of the illustrations by miyamasan hasnt been included if we can release a dxd illustration collection then it seems like we can republish all the illustrations but maybe we need the calls of the fans for this i myself also want the illustration collection book i am also eagerly planning to write a new short story which you can only read there so how about
we release high school dxd miyamazero illustration collection vol1 fujimi shobo lastly about the next volume finally the opening of the fourth story arc like my advance notice i will be digging in into the settings of magicians and vampires first and volume 14 will have ravel as the mainthe girls will be in action even more since the guys had too much screen time in volume 12 the girls will be on the offensive after reflecting back on it will xenovia and irina who got a harsh comment have their comeback what about the training for asia and koneko look forward to fourth story arcreferences 1 trading card game also known as tcg 2 yakitorisensei this is the nickname of ishibumis friend and fellow author dairaku kenta dairaku kenta is also a light novel author who also publishes his work in fujimi shobo under their fujimi fantasia bunko label he is currently the author of the light novel big4 ironically even though his name is yakitorisensei he doesnt like yakitori that much 3 tasogareiro no utatsukai it is translated as the usersinger of the colour of dusk this is a light novel title which was published by fujimi shobo

it life1 i work as a devil part 1 i open my eyes to a familiar ceiling above me aah so that was a dream apparently i was having a pleasant dream but later it turned into a nightmare it had a great start my wedding with buchou whom i look up to it was so good until my heart is beating fast anyone would feel the same if they had the same dream im breathing faster too i lift my upper body upright and wipe the sweat on my forehead with my ha nd wow so much sweat im shocked at the amount of of it at the same time i realise that i used my left arm to wipe it that last scene that red dragon i just cant come to believe it since it had too many fantasy elements in it though it turned into a monsters arm at the end of my dream theres nothing wrong with my left arm but i do understand that there is something possessed within this arm i look at the clock its 430 am its still early i take a deep breath and then get back inside my bed no
that isnt it i remember now its time i get out of bed and get ready when i look outside the window there is a red haired beauty rias gremory buchou she is wearing a red jersey and is standing at the gate shes a senior and a school i dol at the high school i go to shes also the president of the occult research club that i am part of and her real identity is a devil she looks this way with her blue eyes after she realises that im looking at her hurry up she mouthed while smilin g im coming now i change from my pyjamas into a jersey immediately and left the room to do morning training part 2 zeha zeha hey dont run so miserably otherwise ill add 10 more laps of dashing afterwards im running in the residential area losing my breath buchou who is riding a bicycle behind me fires me up without hesitation you are strict like always about a month ago i was reincarnated from a human into a devil i became buchous rias gremory samas servant devil devils are beings that get summoned by humans who then grant their
wish in exchange for a price they do that kind of work on a daily basis buchou is no exception i have been working daily as buchous servant devil and am walking towards my goal one step at a time whats my goal thats obvious im going to become the harem king zeha the words slipped out from my mouth while running thats right and for that you need to start from daily basic training you have to become stronger even by a littl e yes buchou i know that im currently a newborn devil but if i earn achievements and get promoted then i can receive a peerage if that happens i can have my own servants just like buchou thats right im going to make lots of girls into my serv ant devils and im going to make my dream come true for that i need to get stronger just like buchou said strength is absolute in the world of devils simply put the stronger you are the higher you can aim well you can rise up with knowledge tradi ng skills and other kind of skills but i have no talent in those areas at the moment
so nothing will start unless i increase my stamina thats why im currently training every day but buchou is a spartan instructor 1 for my servant to be weak is something i cant forgive so she shows no mercy during my morning training she makes me run approximately 20km and after that makes me do over 1 00 laps of dashes she also has me do various muscle training exercises i dont even want to count how many of them ive done devils are the residents of night that unleash their powers during this time i thought that it was better to train at night rat her than in the morning but apparently that isnt the case according to buchou training under sunlight which we are weak against makes us mentally stronger as well i have been suffering from muscle pain every day but getting used to it is a scary th ing and it doesnt hurt like it did in the beginning lately i have been able to do them quite easily its proof that i have been improving daily after all im in a good state in physical education class my short sprint record has shortened and it
is nt that tiring to do long distance sprints any more haahaa i stop running when i arrive at the park which is the goal im sweating all over my body good job now well move on to the dashes the oni buchous smile is so dazzling 2 part 3 your ability has more meaning when you have a good foundation yes 65 i started doing push ups at the park after i completed the morning mar athon and dashes buchou is sitting on my back the feeling of her soft buttocks is superb but i have no time to enjoy it since my arms are crying in pain no actually the feeling of her buttocks is the best whip auu i had my butt slapped by buchou my voice slipped out of my mouth im not a masochist either you are having dirty thoughts the movement of your hips is lecherous t thats 68 t thinking that you are horse riding on me 69 is making my guts as a horse into the max gear 70 talking while doing push ups you seem to have grown ise should i add another hundred buchou said something impossible while smiling i
will die i will be in a state of near death if that happens hmm it shoul d be about time that she gets here huh whos coming when i asked her i heard a familiar voice that said excuse me i look towards the direction that the voice came from while staying in the push up posture isesan buchou san im sorry for being late hauu the blonde haired girl asia trips over isesan heres your tea yyeah thanks im taking a break while sipping on the tea asia gives me after the push ups i did muscle training for my stomach and back so my whole body is hurting asia why are you here when i asked the blonde beautys cheeks became red i heard that ise san and buchou san are doing training here every morning so i wanted to be of help to ise san though i was only able to prepare tea today asia you are such a wonderful girl im deeply moved uuu asia im deeply moved by your kindness asia aaah i never expected that there would come a day when a girl would say that to me i sip my tea while
crying with joy asia is a former sister who has blonde hair and green eyes former means that she isnt a sister any more right now she is a devil of the gremory group last month she was involved in an incident that resulted in her being killed by a fallen angel asia died but thanks to buchous p ower she was reincarnated as a devil the fallen angels are the evil angels mentioned in the bible and novels their trait is their black wings i think they are the archenemies of devils and are always fighting with them last month i was also involved in their fight at that time i realised how weak i was so i started training like this to get stronger i dont want asia to go through that sadness ever again our master buchou seems to be thinking about something while drinking green tea whats w rong buchou when i asked her she came back to her senses and coughed no its nothing more than that its good timing i decided to have it done today so lets head over to your house now huh why my house good timing what are we going
to do at my house its about time that the luggage arrives i would come to know what she meant 10 minutes later part 4 t this is my eyebrows are twitching after seeing the boxes that are placed in front of the entrance of my home what are these these boxes dont even have the name of the sender i have a mysterious feeling about this there arent any bombs inside them right now then ise carry these to the room buchou said this to me while i made a confused face huh carry i have to carry these to my house yes these are asias belongings carrying them is what a gentleman would do right a these are asias belongings im in deep shock but then buchou says something even more shocking yes starting today asia will be living in your house family meeting among all the famous meetings conferences and assemblies of the world its considered among the top ranks for the place of negotiations the words of the parents who hold the authority are the biggest factor for dec iding outcomes the way we the children negotiate is the key to this but my parents who
are supposed to have the authority are down on their knees when in front of buchou maybe buchous eyes that have power which cant be seen with their eyes are m aking them act that way okaa sama otou sama because of this situation will you allow asia argento to stay here buchou gave my parents a reckless order elegantly and cheerfully the two of them whisper in each others ears while staring at asia hu h they are also looking at me my dad coughs once then asks asia a question asia san was it yes ise sans otou sama asia responded back with a nervous face ootou sama ku i dont know how to put it but having beautiful foreign girls call me otou sama repeatedly sure does ring a bell in my heart in a good way it seems like my dad is getting emotional getting called otou sama by two young beautiful girls will obviously make him happy even im confident that i would fall for it if two beautiful girls called me onii chan otou san my mum pokes my dad my dad comes back to his senses aahem even if you want to stay
here our stupid son is an embodiment of sexual desire its unfortunate but isnt it better for you to stay in a house where there is a girl i would be too ashamed if something were to happen this shitty dad doesnt hold back on his own son an embodiment of sexual desire i feel bad because he isnt that far off but what my dad just said is logical it would be better to make her stay in a house where theres also a girl even my mum is right beside him and agreeing saying yeah thats right if a beautiful blonde girl stays with me who has so much sexual desire you dont know what might happen it would b ecome a worldwide problem my parents probably wanted to say that but i wont do anything im sure not trusted at all huh by the way i havent told them that asia and i are devils and that asia was used by a fallen angel even if i told them they w ouldnt believe me and its better for my mum and dad to not get involved with devils we left out lots of stuff while explaining the
situation to them and also included some things we made up buchou doesnt seem to be affected by my parents refusal an d continues to negotiate with a smile then what about if asia becomes your daughter then wwhat do you mean with that profound word buchou what do you mean otou sama asia believes in ise very much very much its the same for me as well is e does lack a bit of intelligence and is very straightforward but he is not a fool instead he has such a burning soul that he would walk towards any obstacle and try to overcome it both asia and i are drawn to that part of ise especially asia isnt t hat right asia yyes ise san saved me by risking his life he is my life saviour he also helps me a lot at school even in class he then asia starts happily explaining how im helping her out at school every day while putting on a big smile she even tells them minor things and over exaggerates them uooooo im so embarrassed that i want to run away from this place my parents are like oh our ise did
and for him to be useful to others and they seem like they arent dissatisfied with wha t they are hearing well any parent would be happy if their child was being praised then buchou gives them the final push what if this home stay is also bride training then bride what is that dad mum and i shout out very loudly asia is like and is putting on a confused look tears then there are loads of tears flowing out of dads eyes he then speaks while wiping his tears since ise is like this i was sure that i would never see grandchildren i was always depressed that i had t o worry about ise living by himself even after i get very old what otou sama suddenly started to speak his thoughts rather whats with that irresponsible future map that you created for your own son my mum is wiping her tears beside him wait you are crying too i also thought that ise would never get a bride its because hes ise the stupid son i tried raising him so he wouldnt become a shame to society but that all turned out to be a waste
since hes turned out this way if i could go bac k to the past i would convince my younger self by telling her that be careful since that son of yours will turn into a worthless son who hides lecherous dvds inside his plastic model box hidden in his locker uwaaaaaa my secret porn location mum kno ws my dad holds asias hand asia san hes a worthless son like this but can i leave him to you you are wrong ise san isnt a worthless person hes a very wonderful person asia doesnt realise what my dad is getting at and smiles my mum who saw that broke down by crying out loud what is this what drama am i watching rias san we will look after asia argento san in this house buchou smiles after hearing dads approval thank you very much otou sama ise i will leave asias care to y ou from now on asia you will be staying here with ise so make sure not to be impolite get along with ises parents is it really alright wont it be a burden if i stay to get familiar with japanese culture and lifestyle its
best to stay w ith the people from that country when i asked you who among our club members you wanted to live with the most you did say ise without a second thought right buchou replied to the confused asia oh i see so thats the reason asia is staying at rias buchous place shes borrowing one of the rooms in the old school building that buchou asia and i go to yyes i indeed said that but its fine asia san get used to japan at our house you might stay here permanently after all dad you really are trying to make asia my wife huh see even otou sama is saying this though asia was confused she finally smiles when she sees buchou smiling i understand buchou san there were things i didnt quite understand but i will be in your care ise san and ise sans otou sama and okaa sama youve been perfectly deceived dad mum surely the thing about my bride is a perfect blow to them like this its been decided that asia will be living with me bride huh i got very anxious of b uchou who was making a sad face
at that time part 5 a few days have passed since asia started living in my house the weathers nice today ise san we are playing softball for physical education today its my first time so im excited asia is happily walking towards the school im walking next to her i never thought that a day would come when i would be able to walk to school every day with a beauty the students who go to the same school as us are looking at us with intense eyes why is asia san w alking from the same direction as hyoudou impossible whats going on it must be some kind of mistake not just rias oneesama but even asia san just like that i can hear the scream like words from other students well thats natural this s ituation would seem impossible for anyone who knows me i who was just an unpopular perverted student am now suddenly getting along with the schools idols im also walking to school every day with the new blonde student everyone has been talking about since arriving from other peoples view this is an unbelievable situation there were some students who confessed to asia
because they were like if hyoudou can so can i but they were rejected immediately because of that there are those who hold a grudge against me even now there are people looking at me with eyes filled with hatred other guys must think im playing around with the beautys body its not as simple as they think but thats okay fufu this is fun in its own way even if its a m isunderstanding they think im popular with girls oh yeah thats it just get jealous of me boys im still going to rise higher fuhahahaha was there something that looks funny oh asia looks at my face with a worried look when a beautys face is right in front of me it makes me blush looks like im still young nno its nothing by the way asia are there any problems at school are you getting along with other girls those are the things im most concerned about a former sister has just transferred to our school since her lifestyle was far different from ours she might feel lost in school life at times like this i will definitely help her however whats most important is for
her to be supported by other girls i think she is getting along with the girls from the occult research club but im concerned about her interaction with the other classmates i dont think she is getting bullied for not being used to this lifestyle but i cant stop myself from being worried about it nothing like that is happening as far as i can tell but she might be bullied when im not there however asia smiles which comes from the bottom of her heart which then rejects my concern about her everyone is very kind towards me they are teaching me a lot of things so i would get familiar with japan i also made lots of friends i was also invited to go shopping with them thats good to hear looks like her relationship with the other classmates is going well now one of my concerns is gone while talking about that we arrive at school and then go towards the classroom now with the problem of asias school life settled the remaining problem is asia chan good morning good morning asia san your blonde hair is shining today as well as soon as we a rrive
in the class the bald headed guy matsuda and the guy wearing glasses motohama approach asia these two are my pals they are famous for being perverted along with me good morning matsuda san motohama san the two of them get emotional after g etting greeted by asia this is the thing isnt it motohama kun thats right matsuda kun getting greeted by having a beauty say good morning gives life to us this morning like usual they feel happy about minor things but until recently i wa s probably the same as them fufufu having this much confidence sure does change people punch gufu when i was acting cool motohama punches me in my stomach wwhat was that for baldy i argued against him but he continues to laugh and kicks my leg it really hurts what is this idiot doing hahaha ise kun i heard about it heard what i hear that you walk to school with asia chan every day right wwhat about it thats weird why why do you two come to the school from the same dir ection i wonder why hmm i dont know where he heard it from but it looks like he
heard the rumours about me and asia as well i lift my lips and put on a lecherous smile i then say it listen matsuda motohama there is a wall between me and you tw o which you guys definitely cant overcome this cant be helped wwhat are you getting all proud of tthats right ise just because you get along with asia chan i then give a finishing blow i also put on an expression of victory i live with asia under one roof right asia yes i am being taken care of at ise sans house both of them got quiet after seeing asia answer with a smile it looks like they are speechless fu fuhahahaha hahahaha i won i won its a lie matsuda deni es it strongly hes even crying they are tears of jealousy fuhahaha cry scream and die iimpossible ise living with a blonde beauty in the same house that cant bethe law of this world will collapse motohama fixes the position of his glas ses with his shaking hand hes also trembling even though hes desperately trying to act calm tthen do you even get woken up by asia chan in the morning
matsudas question how miserable asia looks like i made you wake me up today as well beca use ise san is such a sleepy head ufufu ah matsuda drops on the floor does she even refill the plates for you this time motohama asks mum also praised that you are a thoughtful girl asia oh myyou are making me blush asia blushes while putting her hand on her cheek i looked at her with confidence and a smile seeing that motohama glares right at me through his glasses and it looks like hes about to shed tears of blood man having my friend being jealous of me sure is scary seriousl y life sure can be turned upside down with a single change just being friendly with one beauty is enough for guys to get a happy life yeah even if all the girls in the class will come to hate me im all right as long as asia is on my side ah thats not good my aim is to get a peerage and become a great devil and then make lots of beauties into my servant then i have to become a guy that girls will like but
it seems like i wont be able to get along with girls you you actually know lots of cut e girls dont you rias senpai akeno senpai they are the two great onee samas of our academy you know then our schools small idol toujou koneko chan and now the blonde beauty that just transferred asia chan this is wrong its so unfair that im about to break matsuda whines while holding his head down cry as much as you want my friend just like he said im getting along with several beauties lately especially asia whom i walk to school with and it seems like im being adored by rias senpai and akeno senpai as well yeah im in the winners group now definitely in a winners group this might be the best point of my life ill have to enjoy it so that i dont regret it afterwards while im thinking about that motohama fixes his gl asses calmly ise i dont think introducing a single girl to us will be a bad thing no i mean please introduce us to someone i beg you please motohama says it while putting his face close to mine he says
it with a low tone however it has so much intensity to it but introducing the only beauties i talk to are the ones matsuda just mentioned in other words i dont have any connections with other girls rather they dont even take me seriously its a harsh reality it means that i dont have ties with human girls the girls i get along with are all devils well even though they are devils they are all cute so its not a problem hmm yeah thats right well its not like i dont know someone there is one person that i know of i took my mobile phone out and check for the name yup i have it this should be okay hold on a sec i made my two pals and asia wait here for a bit and then went to the corner of the room so i can get an approval from the said person we talked for a few minut es but it seems like that person is okay with it thats good well i found one person thats okay with meeting you guys that person will also bring friends as well this is the number of
the person i can introduce you guys to contact that person thro ugh mail first that way you guys will feel happier thank you matsuda who was down on the floor until a moment ago grabs my mobile phone hey hey thats a quick change until a second ago he was crying this guy truly is the two of them copies the number into their phones thank you so much ise sama i will never forget this debt yeah lets do a triple date next time just wait we will also make a girlfriend instantly the two of them are giving a good smile it seems like they are experien cing happiness or rather the inside of their head is in party mode so what kind of person is she shes a beauty right matsuda asks about the appearance of the person i just introduced i answer while scratching my cheek umm yeah shes a maiden that im sure of maidenw wonderfulthats really wonderful ise kun man we just cant thank you enough ise sensei these guys are just pathetic they keep on changing their attitudes no i would have been like them if i hadnt met with buch ou
and asia im sorry for having all the fun guys matsuda asks me once again with a smiley face oh ise kun by the way why is mil tan called mil tan i will like for you guys to ask him yourself even i dont know the reason part 6 that night im pedalling my bike in the residential area oryaaaaaa i pedal my bike with all my strength when we reached the designated area asia who is sitting behind me puts the leaflet into the mail box its done ok i started pedalling my bicycle again a fter i confirm that asia is sitting behind me the leaflet we just put in that house is a convenient item used to summon us devils normally you need to draw a magic circle to summon a devil but in this century there arent that many humans who are willing to draw a magic circle to summon devils more like there arent that many humans who believe in devils in the current era i also didnt until recently therefore the devils society that was in a tight situation created a leaflet with a magic circle on it which can summon devils more
easily each devil stamps on their own personal magic circle onto the leaflet and just like ordinary advertisements they write an advertisement phrase on it this leaflet is nothing to those that are satisfied with thei r lifestyles but to those that are craving for something it has a magic cast on it so they will want to use it we appear in front of humans who will become our contractors through the magic circle we grant their wish in exchange for a price thats how it works so this is the current method used to summon devils and handing this leaflet out is the first job of the servant devils this became a customary practice for a temporarily time we use a devils portable device to find humans with a strong gree d and put the leaflet into their mailbox and then move onto the next location repeating this is a devils job well i have finished the job of handing out leaflets already the reason why i am doing this is ise san is it really alright to help me hand out the leaflets yeah its not a problem yes im assisting asia in handing out the leaflets
so like this i continue to pedal the bicycle asia you dont know how to get on a bike right then someone has to ride the bike for you uu im sorry i never had a chance to get on a bike but if its walking i cant let you do that even more im worried about you asia thats my true feeling its not about whether she can ride a bicycle or not but more of the fact that i cant let asi a run around in an unfamiliar environment she had just come to japan from northern europe last month she doesnt know that much about japanese culture she gained the ability to understand japanese after becoming a devil but its a different story if it s to adapt to this lifestyle im teaching her starting from the basics but there are still many things that make me worry about her on top of that asia is kind to anyone and doesnt know how the world goes around you wont know what kind of bad thing s will fall upon her so i ended up suggesting to buchou after thinking about it i will help asia with handing
out the leaflets buchou gladly accepted my request thank you very much buchou like that im supporting asia so i have been going around the residential area at night on my bicycle together with her look asia thats a shrine were devils so we cant enter it i talked about a certain shrine when we went pass it yes devils arent allowed to go to places where spirits gather and the local god lives yes its hard for me to understand japanese shinto gods because im a christian it will be hard for her who has been raised under a single religion to understand the japanese culture thats what buchou told me so i started to tea ch asia things about the place we live in while we hand out leaflets ah over there its closed now but that bakery shop sells good bread you want to go buy some next time yes japanese breads are sweet so i love them even a normal conversation i s fun a date at night thats the best i always wanted to ride a bicycle with a girl sitting behind me like this isesan have you watched the film roman holiday asia asks
me roman holiday oh yeah i think its a film its an old film right no sorry i havent watched it is that so asia sounds a bit sad to my answer but what about that film its always have been my admiration it was just like this however they were riding a bike in the film even so i ufufu huh she sounds r eally happy right now even her arms that are across my hips got stronger im not really sure but oh well if asia is happy then that will be good enough the wind tonight also feels good part 7 we are back asia and i had finished handing out the le aflets and returned to the club room the unused old school building located behind the school one of the rooms on the third floor is the room for the occult research club and also the gathering place for the gremory group ara ara good work ill make some green tea now the first one to welcome us back is the vice president of our club as well as the staff officer of rias buchou himejima akeno san she is my senior a third year
student and is a japanese beauty with long silky black hair who is alway s smiling she is also a person that wears a pony tail hair style which is rare among the current teens along with buchou she is known as one of the two great onee samas of our school and is popular among both boys and girls with the popularity of an idol hey how was the date at night the guy who is sending out a smile at me is kiba yuuto the good looking guy he is the handsome prince who has captured the hearts of most of the girls in our school he is my enemy since i hate good looking guys it was obviously the best i put my thumbs up towards kiba illicit sexual relationship late at night the one who just said a harsh thing to me is the small build first year student toujou koneko chan at first glance she only looks like a grade sc hool student but because shes a loli girl she is popular in our academy for being our school mascot asia and i walk towards buchou who is sitting on the sofa our king rias
buchou even tonight your crimson hair is beautiful like always buchou w e are back i reported to her but buchou is looking towards a certain direction while being dazed is she thinking about something she even makes a deep sigh asia who is next to me also looks in the direction buchou is looking towards buchou we are back this time i raised my voice buchou heard me and came back to her senses iim sorry i was dazed for a bit good work ise asia lately it seems that buchou is thinking about something often when she orders us to do something she does it wi th elegance like usual but other than that her mind goes off to somewhere else i think the number of times she has sighed increased as well she possibly has some serious concerns that we possibly wont be able to understand well she is a highclass d evil after all so these are the members of the occult research club and also the members of the gremory group other than me everyone else is super popular at school well im famous for being a perv hahaha i feel like apologising since i
feel im in the wrong place buchou then says it after confirming that asia and i have arrived now then i will have asia make her dbut as a devil starting tonight oh seriously eh i say it to asia who is puzzled asia you will be having your actual dbut as a devil tonight you are going to a contractors place through the magic circle mme asia points to herself while panicking right buchou buchou nods to my question yes handing out the leaflets will end today if i let it go on forever it s eems that the date between you two will continue even further uwa please stop bullying your servants buchou im feeling a bit embarrassed if buchou says that to me like the same time as my debut buchou draws the magic circle of the gremory clan on a sias palm thanks to that you will be able to transport through the magic circle akeno check whether asia has enough demonic power to transport through the magic circle yes buchou akeno san put her hand on asias forehead after buchou orders her a faint light appears from her finger tips and it seems like she
is reading something we had the incident with ise before so we need to check properly though i dont think there will be a same problem i feel down after hearing buchous worry thats right my debut as a devil was awful to use the magic circle you need a little bit of demonic power but i didnt even have that little bit of demonic power at all thanks to that i couldnt transport through the magic circle and i have to use a bicy cle to go to the client which is something no one has done before even now i have to visit the clients by bicycle this is hard to endure buchou its okay theres no problem at all more like she has the most demonic power after buchou and me her potential capacity for her demonic power is very good buchou smiles at akeno sans report thats good news she can use her power as a bishop to the fullest the bishop buchou just mentioned is asias role as a devil the current devils have rule s that are based on the game of chess of the humans world for their servants the devil who is
a master is a king and below them are the queen the rooks the bishops the knights and the pawns the system for the servant devils that the c urrent devils uses the evil piece previously buchou and others told me that long time ago many devils died against the war with god and the fallen angels and this system was created to increase the forces of the devils with having only small numbers of underlings in order to keep the balance against the other factions each piece has its own traits that boost up the ability of a servant devil of course by having buchou as our leader who is also our master we also have certain roles akeno san is a queen kiba is a knight koneko chan is a rook asia is a bishop and i am a pawn at first glance pawn seems weak but depending on the way you use it it can even take down a king thats what buchou told me i have to believe that since i am aiming to become the strongest pawn going back to the topic since asia has high demonic power she has no problem transporting through the
magic circle yup looks like asia began from a good start im also satisfied with that then asia will also get along with her client and then i started to feel uneasy what will happen to asia who is kind to anyone and who doesnt know how the world goes around when she gets summoned by someone with lots of greed case 1 oh what a cute devil san oh yeah please show me your panties please also show me your breasts thats bad case 2 beautiful devil chan let me grope your oppai as much as i want in exchange for my life asias case 3 i will give you my life so let me have sex with you till the night ends ise are you crying buchou looks into my face with a worried look buchou no its a no i shake my head to the side while having tears flow from my eyes its a no thats right no its asia that we are talking abo ut theres no way asia is able to decline when some guy she hasnt met asks her a lecherous order asia who is serious and passionate about her work will try
to accomplish it even sacrificing her own body buchou i feel uneasy if asia goes alone if asia i cant stand it if some weirdo asks some sick wish to asia buchou seems a bit troubled after i approached her while crying ise a request which is too lecherous for the devils they summoned doesnt come to the servant devils of the gremory clan there are humans who request those kinds of wishes so there are devils who take those clients as their profession and requests like that goes to them the jobs we take are safe you know even devils have areas that they are professional at buchou y ou are telling the truth right thats the truth right but still i feel super uneasy buchou sighs after seeing me so worried about it alright for a short time ill put you with asia to support her are you satisfied with that tthank you very m uch asia let me handle the pervs asia you can just make the contract normally yyes i take asias hand and make a sigh of relief asia herself looks worried that she is causing trouble for me but thats okay i need to
protect asia i even made a promise with buchou im also worried about asia i might be over protective towards her but i want to look after her until she says i can do it by myself you have to do these kinds of things until they get annoyed with you i will protect asia eve n if it makes her hate me so then if a request comes asia you will transport through the magic circle by taking ise with you yes i understand buchou after she confirms it the big magic circle on the floor glows akeno san who is in charge of t he magic circle starts to read the devils letters that appeared in a section of the magic circle ara ara there is a client trying to summon us who wants to wish something that even asia chan can handle hearing akeno sans report buchou smiles thats very convenient asia can supply the demonic power needed for teleporting through the magic circle and she can also support ise who lacks demonic power as well lets do it then hmm i was the one who is supposed to help her but it looks like im t
he one needing the help thats okay i just need to watch over asia doing her first job lets go asia yes ise san asia and i went towards the centre of the magic circle after getting our spirits up part 8 i returned home late at night with asi a asia finished her first job safely unlike my debut it went smoothly im sorry i will take the bath first then saying that asia heads towards the bathroom she cant stop smiling because she has accomplished her first job i also went to my room to rest ah both my mind and body is worn just like every night after asia finished her job we went back to the club room and reported to buchou and finished our job as a devil for the night i have concerns for buchou who had a sad face being conce rned about buchou is good but it will be my turn to have a bath after asia is done using the same bath a girl was in i know i shouldnt think about lecherous things but im that age when i have to so there is a part of me getting excited

to teleport to my room the magic circle makes a big glow that lit up the whole room and a person appears from it its the silhouette of a girl a girl with crimson hair buchou the one that appears from the magic circle is none other than rias buchou but why is she in my room she seems to have the face of those corne red her expression is the same as the one she had back in the clubroom buchou approaches me soon as she sees me then she says something shocking to me make love to me excuse me my mind went blank because of the sudden thing what did she say ju st now did i go deaf buchou says it again to make sure i heard it since i have a confused look i want you to take my virginity immediately buchous japanese is stimulating as always life2 i pick a fight part 1 hurry go to the bed i will get r eady for it now buchou hassles me while taking her uniform off hhold on what is this whats happening my mind cant catch up to buchous actions strip she takes her skirt

the best quality marshmallow no you still cant describe this sensation with expressions like that you absolutely cantttttt do you realise it bucho u says that to me with a charming voice im also nervous you can tell by my heart beat right now that you mention it i can feel her heart beating fast through her soft oppai that im touching with my right hand if i look carefully her pure white sk in starts to turn red b buchou is also nervous so buchou who usually acts with elegance gets nervous for her first time as well huh then buchou starts to strip my clothes off uwaaaaaah im getting stripped naked by a giiiiiirl bbut i i dont act ually have the confidence i accidentally made a whiny voice because im so nervous well obviously thats because i really am a virginnnnnn buchou gets her face close to mine and says it are you trying to embarrass me explode with that comment my brain blows i know its the sound indicating that i cant hold my instinct back anymore i grab buchou by her shoulders and put her down against my bed on my bed there is a
fully naked girl below me shes saying that i can do her make your determinat ion hyoudou issei im not really sure but my time has come i have to do it wait is this really all right but i cant control myself if the beauty i admire says things like this to me after i gulped down my spit and took a deep breath i lean my bo dy against buchou flash then the floor of my room flashes once again w what is it seeing that buchou sighs looks like i was a bit late buchou stares at the magic circle with disgust the symbol on the magic circle is gremory group who is it kiba akeno san koneko chan wait no matter who it is getting caught in this situation is baaaaaad but my prediction was wrong and the person who appears from the magic circle is a silver haired woman her clothes look like that of a maid is she a maid the beautiful silver haired maid speaks silently after seeing me and buchou are you trying to break the agreement by doing something like this the maid says it plainly as if she is astonished
buchou twitches her eyebrows hearing that if i don t go this far both otou sama and onii sama wont listen to me right both sirzechs sama and the master will become sad after they find out that you tried to give your purity to some lowly person like this master s sirzechs sama who is it from what buchou said is it her father and her brother so buchou has a brother but lowly shes talking about me right i feel a bit shocked if someone i just met calls me that hearing the maid woman say that buchou becomes unpleasant immediately my purity i s mine only whats wrong with giving it to someone whom i acknowledge also dont call my cute servant lowly even if its you i wont forgive you grayfia bbuchouuuuu im so moved because you became mad for me the woman called grayfia picks up buch ous bra anyway you are the next heiress of the house of gremory so please dont show your skin to a man recklessly even more so if you are in the middle of this situation she then puts the bra on buchous body the woman looks at me
she then bows her head down how do you do im a maid that serves the house of gremory my name is grayfia pleased to make your acquaintance i received a polite introduction from her i feel a bit awkward because i was called a lowly person when i first saw her bu t if i look carefully shes quite a beauty if shes human then she will be in her early 20s she seems like a calm and collected person and her silver hair that is shining looks beautiful she has her hair split into three strings which are then knotte d with each other grayfia san huh i think older woman are also quite good pinch buchou pinches me because im gazing at grayfia san it hurts buchou grayfia did you come here of your own accord or because the household sent you or is it onii sama buchou makes an unpleasant face somehow shes acting like girls her age this is a new side of her i havent seen all of them grayfia san answers like that hearing that buchou sighs as if she is giving up is that so you who is brothers q ueen came
to the human world personally so it can only be one thing i understand buchou picks her clothes up she puts her arm through her clothes her wonderful naked body is getting covered im sorry ise lets make it so that the thing from ear lier never happened i wasnt thinking straight either lets forget about todays incident ah so its over then w well i dont know whats going on either but i know that i will definitely regret it afterwards ise wait is this person hmm g rayfia looks at me with a shocked expression i never expected a cool woman like her to be this shocked yes hyoudou issei my pawn the user of the boosted gear boosted gear the one possessed by the emperor of dragons what is it suddenly grayfia san starts to look at me as if shes looking at something extraordinary grayfia lets go back to my room i will listen to what you have to say over there akeno can also attend right the priestess of thunder i dont mind its a must fo r high class devils to have their queen by their side all the time very well ise buchou
calls me she walks towards me and then she chu buchous lip touches my cheek wow uoooooooooooo i got kissed on the cheeeeeeeek please forgive me f or today with this i troubled you a lot lets meet again in the clubroom tomorrow she gives me a farewell and disappears in the magic circle together with grayfia san im the only one left in the room now im standing there dazzled while touching t he cheek where i was kissed isesan i finished using the shower i heard asias voice soon after that part 2 next morning asia and i are walking towards school i rub my eyes since i wasnt able to get a single bit of sleep damn it damn ittttttttt t i regretted it about last night i regretted so much i was suffering inside my bed the feeling of the oppai in my hand and the image of buchous naked body burned into my eyes has impacted both my mind and soul so i got up at night and started to do lot of lecherous things by myself for the whole night i had to pleasure myself because i had so much hornyness within my body
since she stopped right before doing it thats why im flat out tired from the morning are you okay asia asks me with a wo rried voice i feel like i know how dirty i am when i get stared at by her innocent eyes im sorry asia i was doing something you shouldnt know about while you werent looking i cant tell her that buchou wanted to have sex with me last night no matter what you didnt do the morning training today so i thought your body was hurt asia seems like she is very worried im very sorry the morning training was cancelled today i received a call early this morning from buchou and she cancelled it by say ing can we cancel it today well i cant do training with buchou herself in this state im walking towards the classroom while my legs are moving very slowly then iseeeeeeeeee matsuda is running towards me with an extremely pissed face from the end of the corridor ah its about that dieeeeeeee from the other direction motohama is running really fast both of them got ready to do a lariat on me i have nowhere to run since
we are in the corridor hit ugah both of their lariats hit my nec k it hurts idiots i coughed while touching my neck ddont fuck with meeeee matsuda shouts ise you bastard motohama grabs me by my collar and glares at me with eyes filled with murderous intent seriously what is it i acted like i didnt kno w what they are on about but it doesnt stop them from being pissed at me dont fuck around fuck what the heck was that he looked like those really strong guys from a martial arts manga and why was he wearing gothic lolita clothes is that an ulti mate weapon matsuda complains to me while crying looks like the two of them met him yesterday it seems like the impact of mil tan was too much for them miltan a regular customer of mine as a devil my contractor he is a girl born from a man that has the body of the worlds strongest person and he looks up to mahou shoujo his charming point is his gothic lolita outfit and the cat ears he wears you may think this information doesnt make any sense but i cant help
it if this is the truth the h eart of a maiden and a body of a man thats the only explanation i have not only that he also brought some friends he made a gathering of some sorts there were couple of those who looked like mil tan i was so scared i thought i was going to get killed damn so there are more of them just thinking about it gives me shivers and nightmares where do miltan series get produced from yeah i definitely dont want to meet them they were going on about the world of magic whaaaaaat the fuck is the world of magic serabenia i dont know any shit like thaaaaaat matsuda kun continues to complain to me while shaking my body violently in my case they were telling me about how to defeat the dark creatures if i ever encounter one apparen tly you can kill them by using a special item which is made by mixing the salt from the sea of the dead and a flower that only appears at night called moonlight flower and then burn them to make a powder no matter how you think about it a punch
from miltan would be enough to kill any living thing in this world motohama says it to me while holding his head down ii see looks like these two have went through hell congratulations now you can beat the dark creatures whenever you encounter one after i said that matsuda and motohama does a double brain buster on me part 3 buchous problem maybe it has something to do with the house of gremory kiba says that to me while we are walking towards the clubroom located in the old school building i met with kiba while i was on my way to the clubroom along with asia so i asked kiba about how buchou is acting strange lately but it seems like kiba also doesnt know the reason why akeno san would know right kiba nods at my question akeno san is buchous most trusted servant so she obviously would know i know that asking buchou about her problem is rude but i became concerned about her since i was involved in it last night but i dont feel like talking about last night with anyone i mean it will cause an uproar if i do well never mind
anyway if there is a thing i can help her with then i will when we arrived to front of the door kiba notice something for me to finally realise the presence here kiba puts on a serious face by narrowing his eyes huh what is it i open the door without any concerns inside the room are buchou akeno san koneko chan and the silver haired maid grayfia san she sure does act calm buchou has a very unpleasant face akeno san is smiling like us ual but she has cold vibe koneko chan is sitting on a chair at the corner quietly it seems like she doesnt want to get involved with others much as possible the room has an atmosphere where no one is talking kiba quietly says oh my from behind me the three of us goes inside the room but none of the members are talking to us like they always do thats how tense the atmosphere of this room is asia is also feeling uneasy so she holds onto my sleeve with an uneasy face i pat on her head to comfort her and to make her feel safe buchou speaks after looking at
each of us looks like everyone is here before we start the club theres something i need to tell all of you ojou sama do you want me to explain the situation buchou rejects grayfia sans offer by waving her hand the truth is it happens exactly when buchou speaks the magic circle on the floor glows eh teleportation but all of the people from gremory group are here so is it a devil who serves the house of gremory just like grayf iasan after this i realise that my guess is way off from the correct answer and i will come to realise that i still lack knowledge as a devil the symbol of the gremory drawn on the magic circle changes into an unfamiliar pattern what is this isn t this the gremorys magic circle phoenix thats what kiba who is close to me says phoenix t then it isnt a gremory the light shines through the room and a person appears from the magic circle flame flames come out from the magic circle and the room gets flowed with heat hot sparks are burning my skin there is a silhouette of a man inside the flames when
he swings his arm across to the side the flames disappear fuu its been a while since i came to the humans world the one standing th ere is a man wearing a red suit since hes wearing his suit casually he didnt have a tie and his shirt is opened till his chest he looks like hes in his early 20s hes handsome but he seems more of the bad boy type he has his hands inside his pocke ts somehow he looks like a host more like is he a host devil his good looking face kind of pisses me off if kiba is the gentle type then this guy is the wild type the guy looks around the room and then smirks after finding buchou my lovely rias i came to see you m my lovely rias this guy what kind of relation does he have with buchou buchou is looking at him with her eyes half closed it doesnt seem like she is welcoming this guy but the guy doesnt seem to care and approaches buchou now then rias lets go and take a look at the ceremony hall the date of the ceremony is decided
so we need to check it before then what a frivolous guy from which household is this devil from kiba said phoenix earlier the guy grabs buchous arm wwhat a rude guy let go of me riser buchou says that with a deep and serious voice while shaking the guys hand off uwah her voice sounds really scary shes really pissed off the guy called riser doesnt seem to care ab out having his hand shook off and is just smirking somehow his slight movement is ticking me off im starting to get pissed i then say this to him hey you you are being rude to buchou actually whats with that attitude towards a girl i said it clearly to him the guy looks at me and starts looking at me as if he is looking at some trash this bastard is pissing me off even more ah who are you he said it with a displeased voice its totally different from the sweet voice he has towards buc hou nggh hes clearly looking down on me i can feel his hatred towards me but i will say what i have to i am the servant devil of rias
gremory sama im the pawn hyoudou issei i said it to him i even told him my name hows that host devil hmm ah okay slip i slipped after he makes a dull reaction ughsomehow i feel hurt by that kind of reaction so you dont care about me is that right i mean who the heck are you the guy seems a bit surprised by my question oh rias you haven t mentioned me to your servants i mean are there guys who dont know me a reincarnated devil even so i didnt tell them because there was no need oh my harsh like always hahaha the guy starts laughing then grayfia san comes into the discus sion hyoudou issei sama yyes this person is riser phoenix sama hes a pure blood high class devil and the third son of the house of phoenix grayfia san explains it to me about this guy yeah so hes a high class devil from the house of phoeni x so he holds a peerage then isnt that a legendary creature that appears in books and is said to be a fire bird or immortal bird so there are things similar to it
among the devils so how does a guy like that related to buchou a friend or is he som e childhood friend but soon i found out the true reason that far surpasses my prediction and he is the husband of the next heiress of the house of gremory hm h hhusband the next heiressshes talking about buchou right he is engaged to riasojousama huh e eeeeeengageeeeeed eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh i screamed because of the shocking revelation this bastard is rias buchous fianc part 4 the tea made by riass queen is superb thank you very much the guy who praises akeno sans tea riser akeno san is also smiling but she doesnt say her usual ara ara and ufufu i feel a bit scared buchou who is sitting on the sofa riser who carelessly sat next to her and is holding her shoulder buchou keeps on shaking his hands off but the bastard keeps on touching her hair hands and shoulders that guy is way too close to her we her servants are sitting away from the two high class devils and can only look at them ku just looking at him pisses me off he keeps on t ouching her
body if he starts touching her legs im seriously going to jump at him i also want to touch those thighs of hers as well ah if i think about it i already know the sensation of buchous oppai does that make me more amazing since i know the sensation of those breasts even before him who is her fianc fufufu yeah i am i have already seen her naked body twice fufufu so its my win then nuhahaha uumm ise san did something good happen asia who is next to me asks with a worried fa ce huh i made a victory declaration in my mind against riser indecent thinking is prohibited koneko chan gives me her harsh words again ungh does this girl have some power that allows her to read my mind isekun in any case you should wipe yo ur drool kiba gives me a handkerchief with a refreshing smile iits none of your business i tried to wipe my drool with my sleeve but asia wipes it for me with her handkerchief its almost time to eat snacks so you drooled thinking about it cor rect ugh my heart hurts because she said that with
a smile this girl probably doesnt know that i was thinking about naughty stuff thank you asia im sorry asia i thanked her while apologising to her in my heart then at that time stop it alr eady buchous angry voice echoes through the room when i look buchou got up from the sofa and is glaring sharply at riser riser on the other hand is smirking like usual riser i told you before i will not marry you yeah i heard that before but rias that wont do you know i think the situation of your household is quite serious thats none of your concern if im the next heiress for the house of gremory then i will choose who will become my husband my father brother and everyone in th e clan are rushing it also it was a promise that i will be free until i graduate from university of the human world thats right you will basically be free you can go to college and you can do whatever you like with your servants but your otou sama and sirzechs sama are worried they are afraid that your household will become extinct we lost a great
number of pure blood devils in the last war even if the war has ended our rivalry with the fallen angels and god hasnt ended yet its not rare for t he successors of pure blood devil to get killed in the worthless battle against them which leads to the household becoming extinct so for a pure blood devil that are also happens to be a high class devil getting together would be the obvious solution fo r the forces of devils a pure blood high class devil even you know that these children will be important from now on right buchou and riser start to argue about something i dont get but even an idiot like me knows that they are discussing an importa nt thing about the world of devils buchou becomes quiet when riser started a serious topic though her sharp eyes havent changed riser continues to talk after drinking the tea the newly produced devils the ones like your servants the reincarnated d evils are expanding in terms of strength but that would make us the high class devils with old history background lose our place there are old nobles who gets close to the reincarnated
devils because they are very powerful well that might be alright the newly produced devils are also important for our future but we cant allow the pure blood devils to go extinct right you and i were chosen in order to prevent the pure bloods from going extinct my house is safe because i have my older brothers but there are only two siblings in your house and your brother is someone who left the house then there would only be you rias who can inherit the house of gremory if you dont take a husband the house of gremory will go extinct in your generation are you trying to crush the household that has been continuing for a very long time because of the past war there is not even half the number of devils who were referred as 72 pillars this marriage has the future of the devils on the line it seems lik e the discussion is getting really serious the 72 pillars i was told about it from kiba before a long time ago there were 72 devils that held a peerage and each clan had dozens of armies but most of them died in the
war buchous clan are one of th e important pure blood devils that survived the war i was pissed when riser kept on saying engagement but listening to the whole story makes it seem very complicated pure blood devils in other words buchou and riser a pure devil it means their parent s are also pure blood devils a real devil asia and i will be categorised as reincarnated devils then a rule from ancient time huh then my opinion wont mean a thing huh but its alright i will just agree with buchous decision of course thats aft er hearing her true feelings im not going to crush my house and i am willing to take a husband hearing buchou riser makes a big smile oh to be expected from rias then lets but i wont marry you riser i will marry the one i acknowledge eve n the devils from the old noble house have the right to choose buchou talks over riser and says it clearly hearing that riser suddenly becomes unpleasant his eyes become sharper and he even makes a noise with his tongue you know rias im also a devil who carries the name of
house of phoenix behind me i cant let that name get tarnished i didnt even want to come to a small old building like this in the human world rather i dont like the human world that much the fire and wind of this world is filthy for a devil like me who rules fire and wind i cant stand it flame there are flames around riser there are small bits of fire around the room i will take you back to the underworld even if i have to burn all of your servants chills his hostility and killing intent fills the room the pressure from risers body come right at me no at us i feel something cold on my back and it feels like all the hair on my body is about to stand the killing intent directed by a high class devil thi s is bad my hands and body are trembling asia hugs my arm because she got scared yeah asia wont be able to withstand this atmosphere i feel the uneasiness like the time when i fought that fallen angel no its even worse kiba and koneko chan arent trembling but they are getting ready
to fight any time buchou makes a stance against riser and there are red aura coming out of her body riser also starts covering his body with fire intense heat fills the room hot that fire its obvious that we w ill get turned to ash if we get hit by that i can feel the same strength of demonic power as buchou from his flames buchou is stronger than the fallen angel i beat if i can sense the same strength from him does it mean that riser is a devil who is inc redibly strong the flame gathers around risers back and forms into wings of flame exactly like a fire bird the atmosphere is intense but there is one person who interfered calmly its grayfia san ojou sama riser sama please calm down if both of you were to continue then i wont be quiet about it for sirzechs samas honour i wont hold back buchou and riser both make a serious face after hearing grayfia sans quiet and intense voice it seems like they are scared of her riser calms the flam es around his body and sighs while shaking his head to be told that
by the strongest queen even i would be scared i definitely wouldnt want to fight the people from sirzech samas group which is known to be made up of monsters so buchous brot her has that much influential power huh i also didnt know that grayfia san is that strong i dont even feel any killing intent coming from her at all buchou also stops her red demonic power and disbands her battle position looks like we avoided the worst case scenario seeing that both buchou and riser have no intention to fight grayfia san speaks master sirzechs sama and those from the house of phoenix knew it would turn out like this to tell you the truth this was to be the last discussion meet ing everyone knew that it wouldnt be solved so they decided to make a last resort last resort what do you mean grayfia ojou sama if you wish to push your opinion forward then how about you settle it by having a rating game against riser sama buchou becomes speechless hearing grayfia san she seems to be very shocked rating game i think i heard about it before its a game that is played
by the devils with peerage and they compete by making their servants battle kiba explains it to me because i have a confused look oh i think i remember about it its a battle amongst devils where you use your servants pawn knight bishop rook and queen i heard that your strength in the game reflects greatly in your social stan ding among other devils but wasnt that game only played by mature aged devils and buchou who isnt at the mature age cant participate in it grayfia san continues her explanation and answers my questions just as you know ojou sama only mature aged devils can participate in official rating game but if its an unofficial match between pure blood devils even immature devils can participate however in this case when it involves the family and household problems buchou continues to talk while making a sigh in other words otou sama and the others decided to have a game as a last resort if i was to decline right just how far are they intending to interfere with my life to feel satisfied buchou is really ticked off uwahi can feel her urge to kill scary then ojou sama
you are saying you would also decline to participate in the game no i wont since this is a chance alright then lets settle this with a game riser riser smirks after buchous provocative words hee so youre accepting it i dont mind but im already a matured devil and i have already participated in the official game right now i have won most of the games even so you still want to play rias riser replied back with an even more provocative words buchou sends back a fearless smile i will i will blow you away riser fine if you win do whatever you like but if i win you will marry me immediately both of them glares at each other they are both glaring at each other with scary eyes oh their glares are so intense that a low class devil like myself cant butt in understood i grayfia have confirmed both sides opinion i will be in charge of the game between the two household is that okay yes yeah buchou and riser both agrees to grayfia sans approval understood i will inform the two households then grayfia san bows her head after confirming wow it has
turned into a serious situation game so i will be participating in it as well riser looks at me and then smirks he t hen makes a smirk which pisses me off hey rias would the ones here be your servants buchou twitches her eyes at his words so what riser starts laughing after buchou answers him as if he finds it amusing then this match will be a laugh only you r queen the priestess of thunder can fight on par with my adorable servants saying that riser clicks his fingers and the magic circle on the floor glows the magic circle has the same emblem of phoenix that riser appeared from then shadows appear s from the magic circle one two threes shit i got speechless after i saw the number of shadows that appears from the magic circle well these are my cute servants around riser who said that 15 people that seems to be his servants gathers around him theres a person in armour that seems to be a knight theres also a person wearing a hood that seems to be a magician full members just like in real chess you can have a maximum number
of 15 servant devils under your control it seems like high class devils receive 15 evil pieces from the maous you can form a master and servant relationship by using it to those who you want to make as your servant if the person you wish to make your servant has high potential capacities then the chess consu mption can be doubled thats why there are cases where there is only 1 rook or 1 knight buchou also had the same incident that is me you can get a maximum of 8 pawns but buchou used all 8 pieces on me because there is an extremely fiendish thing within me thats why there are high class devils that doesnt have 15 servants but riser has the maximum number of 15 servants its a magnificent view to see all 16 devils including the king we only have one of each of king queen rook bish op knight and pawn so that makes it a 6 versus 16 i got shocked by this fact no im sorry theres something else on my mind i mean i cant help it what is this theyre all girls the knight and the magician i mentioned
earlier are also g irls a girl wearing a chinese dress two girls with beast ears two girls with identical face that seems to be twins a loli girl two older girls with nice bodies a yamato nadeshiko like girl wearing a kimono theres also a girl wearing a dress who loo ks like a european princess a wild looking older woman who is carrying a sword on her back theres also a girl wearing a dancers outfit theres also a mysterious woman wearing a mask that hides half of her face they are all beautiful woman or beautifu l young girls an army of beauty actually exist electricity runs through my body i see so thats what it is this guy riser has actually done it every guys dream a harem the high class devil who turned harem into reality riser phoenix wha t a person what a guy hhey rias this servant kun over here is crying a lot while looking at me riser said it while looking at me he seems to be really freaked out by me buchou places her hand on her forehead when she sees me this boys dream is to have a harem
i think he was moved after looking at your servants yup yup thats exactly right im crying because i saw my dream my objective right in front of me ah what a lucky guy they are all girls gross riser sama this person is freaking me out risers girls make a disgusted face while looking at me damn it fuck you all riser calms them while patting their bodies dont say that my cute girls looking up to upper stream folks is what a lowly ones does lets show them how passionate we are saying that riser starts to have a tongue kiss with one of the girls uwah hes making noise by moving his tongue around buchou seems like she didnt care nnafu the girl is making a sweet voice while putting her legs around r isers ugh its also affecting my crotch hauhauhauuu next to me asia has her face turn red and has her brain blow this view must be too strong for asia riser takes his mouth away while there is a thread of saliva and then starts to tongue kiss a nother girl dont start the 2nd round in here i mean you can actually
do those kinds of things with your servants so we can shit so if i work hard i can become like this one day riser who finished his 2nd tongue kiss smirks while looking down at me you will never be able to do this i feel like this bastard is saying that to me you will never be able to do this dont say what i think you were saying damn it boosted gear i have my head full with rage and am super jealous so i put my left hand up in the air and then shouted while emitting red lights the thing that is possessed in my left arm shows itself a red gauntlet which has a mark of a dragon engraved in it boosted gear its a masterpiece sacred gear that gives enormous power to the possessor i point my finger at riser and then tell him a womaniser like you isnt good enough to be with buchou huh werent you looking up to the so called womaniser ugh he got right at the point sshut up thats different with the thi ng about buchou at this rate you will continue to flirt with other girls
even after you marry buchou heroes love women thats a saying in the human world right a good phrase indeed but this is just a close relationship with my servants arent you also getting adored by rias tthats true but somehow i cant forgive him a hate towards a similar type as me ugggh does it mean im still a kid since im getting irritated the more i come to know hero my ass you are just a bird guy fire bird p hoenix hahaha thats the same as yakitori 3 riser puts a furious expression at my provocation yakitori y you low class deeeeevil dont g et ahead of yourself thats not the way you talk to a high class devil rias whats going on with your discipline towards your servants buchou just looks away and says like i care hey yakitori guy i will just beat the crap out of you with my boos ted gear my boosted gear that i am so proud of it doubles my power every 10 seconds and after a while i can even defeat a god we dont need to have a game i will just take you all down right here
right now boost the sound came from the jewe l located on the gauntlet and at the same time my body gets overflowed with strength its the proof that my power has doubled my strike that even defeated the fallen angel taste it with your own body i was full of spirits but riser just sighs mira do it yes riser sama riser gives an order to his servant she is small just like koneko chan and has a childish face she takes out a stick that martial artists use and makes a battle posture after swinging her stick around hmm i dont feel like f ighting such a small girl but if i knock her stick away she will probably back down thats what i thought but suddenly my body feel lighter it feels like my body is floating huh the floor is craaaaash a loud noise comes to my ears ouch pai n passes through my whole body what happened gahaa im in agony due to the pain in my stomach ouch my stomach was i hit in my stomach isesan asia comes to my side and she put her hands on my stomach instantly a green light
envelops around my body a warm feeling takes the pain in my stomach away its the healing power that asia possesses its a sacred gear that can even heal devils that doesnt even have the divine protection of god however due to this asia was targeted by a fal len angel before more importantly what happened to me i know that im down on the floor when i look around there is a desk broken in half and stuff spread around the floor when i look towards riser the girl who has her stick aimed forward put her s tick away so i got hit i couldnt see it does it mean i received a damage without realising it so i was hit towards the desk riser walks towards me and says it to my ears while crouching down you are weak that word carves a deep scar in my heart the one who you just fought is my pawn mira shes the weakest out of my servants but she has more battle experience and has more talent as a devil than you boosted gear huh riser starts knocking on my sacred gear and starts laughing with hi s nose
this is certainly one of the invincible and dangerous sacred gears by how you use it not only me but you can also defeat a maou and god there were quite a number of possessors who had that before but there havent been any cases where it defe ated a god or maou do you know what this means riser then laughs really loudly it means that this sacred gear is imperfect and the possessors were also bunch of weaklings that couldnt use it you are no exception how do you say this in the human wo rld again yes pearls before swine fuhahaha yeah pearls before swine its about you riass pawn kun riser starts slapping my head while laughing so loud damn it i got so mortified that i clenched my teeth i wanted to talk back but i ca nt its the truth that i am weak i even lost to a girl smaller than me just now i couldnt even see her attack im disappointed in myself but the match would be interesting if you were to get used to it riser put his hand on his chin and it seems like he thought of something
rias how about we have a match in 10 days we could do it now but that wouldnt be interesting are you giving me a handicap are you against it is it humiliating rating game isnt something simple that you can w in with only your feelings if you cant use your servants power to the fullest then you will lose immediately so its not weird for you to train with your servants for your first rating game i have seen devils who lost without using their power to t he fullest countless of times no matter how great their potential and power was buchou doesnt complain and listened quietly to what risers said when riser directs his palm towards the ground the magic circle starts to glow 10 days if its you t hen you should be able to improve your servants he then looks at me dont be a disgrace to rias riass pawn your blow is riass blow i understood immediately that his words carries his concern towards buchou rias the next time we meet will be at the game saying that riser disappears in the light of the magic circle along with his servants part 5
shit i was desperate in keeping my anger and regret within myself while lying down on my bed after that the club activity devils job w as cancelled buchou went deep inside the old school building together with akeno san it seems like they are having a strategy meeting it looks like they are making strategies for the rating game this will be buchous first match of course she wants to cancel the club activity to build a strategy in 10 days thats too soon i wonder if we can gather the factors needed to defeat riser and his servants within that time well it wont change much if a pawn like myself says it more than that i sho wed off in front of buchou and provoked riser only to get beaten down by a small girl uwaaaaah just remembering it makes me want to die because of the embarrassment and regret that i have sigh im so weak i then look at my left arm the absolute po wer which is possessed in here boosted gear which increases the power to no limits but it has many weak points thats me who is vulnerable in other words pearl
before swine just like riser said shit im so weak harem king my dream the devil who accomplished making a harem riser whats the difference between us ah shit i got up from the bed and then start to mess my hair up buchou said she still didnt want to get married she said she didnt want to get married if her husband is riser she chose to battle riser in order to break off the engagement i dont know much about their household and relation between high class devils issues because its too complicated but i will only fight for buchous sake i have a debt of gratitude towar ds buchou a lot in fact i want to fight for buchou i need to support buchou okay from tomorrow morning i will start my training again more like training for the whole day i can skip school if i tell buchou im going to spend my next 10 days on trai ning i will contact kiba so i can learn how to use swords i will ask akeno san how to use demonic powers as well i will learn close combat from koneko chan yup i have decided my
decision is made i will train for the next 10 days i started to feel a bit at ease after making my decision hmm i will go and have a bath now i went downstairs and got ready to take a bath i went inside the bathroom while feeling fired up and then took my clothes off quickly after i take a bath i will talk to asia abou t tomorrow open it happens when i open the door ah what the asia and i meet inside the bathroom a naked me and a naked asia a blonde haired beauty is standing fully naked in front of me what luck no no no i mean accident she was inside since i was thinking about many things i forgot to check if anyone is inside asias body is wet because she was taking a shower her blonde hair which is wet with hot water is glued onto her soft looking white skin i its sexy more than that you hav e nice proportionsasia her tight hips your small buttock is so lovely damn it her thighs arent too skinny nor too fat just the right size for me if i see
these thighs when she wears a skirt i will be down on my knees and her oppai which you can t possibly know when she wears her clothes its not small and it isnt that bad asiaim glad you have grown this much no its not the time for being emotional why on earth am i staring at her body shit why dont i have a three size scouter th is is my second time regretting it next time i will seriously ask motohama to teach me that ability thats the ultimate power isnt it more impressive than my sacred gear thats not it i shouldnt be staring at her anymore ii need to protect her i need to make sure she can live safely thats what i promised myself and yet i got excited by looking at her naked body ccrap if i look carefully asias gaze is moving down towards my crotch no asia its too early for you to look at i was too late covering my partner kyaaa and the one who screamed is me what am i doing i accidentally screamed i mean its embarrassing to have my partner exposed to a girl ah asias
whole body starts to go really red and she looks away hey hey dont forget to hide your private parts asia i can see everything is my thing so astonishing that you forgot to hide your private parts thinking carefully this will be her first time seeing a guys thing since she was a sister the word astonishing wont even describe how she is feeling right now in the worst case it might become a trauma for her oh my what have i done to this poor child ssorry i i will leave now i turned around on the spot so i can leave the bathroom however asia grabs my wrist as if she is trying to stop me from leaving wwhats going on asia chan i im sorry it wasmy first time seeing a boys im sorry i couldnt hear what she said because she said it while mumbling dont push yourself nno im sorry too i came in without checking im sorry i saw a lot of your i apologised as well im the one at fault here i came in without checking who was inside the bath i should have checked even if it wasnt locked after
all we got an additio nal new family member but i saved the image of asias naked body within my memory forgive me if i start remembering this afterwards no i understand everyone told me about the rule when you have a bath in japan s so im all right asia says it shy ly huh s she was told rule japanese rule for what in japan i heard that there is the thing called having a bath together that you get to know each other by having a bath together wwho was it who told asia this wonderfulno who told asi a this weird information no thats not a mistake there certainly is a thing like that in japan but thats only between the same genders asia continues while having her cheeks go red i i was toldto do this with someone i want to form a special r elationship with i i dont mind if its ise sanno i want to deepen my relation with ise san even more thats why will you have a bath together with me nosebleed so much blood comes out from my nose lately it has been happening a lot wait it will
be dangerous if it stays like this any longer asia iim also a guy i will lose myself if i hear a magic word like that this girl doesnt know what will happen to me if i did i mean asia believes in me from the bottom of her heart if i becom e a wolf and push her down noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i cant do that no i want to but i cant i mean its this girl it seems like she will forgive me even if i do her i cant do something like that to someone innocent like her daaaaaaaaaa aammit this is the situation i longed for it was stopped just before the good stuff with buchou this is revenge i know that but why do i feel so guilty when its with asia pushing her down is easy i can do it now with this flow and get a feeling of enjoyment but the problem is after that i know i will regret it very much i probably wont forgive myself for the rest of my life it wont be a problem if it happens after we build that sort of relationship but asia and i arent
in that kind of relat ionship yet last time with buchou i went along with the flow but now i have to control myself simply having a physical relationship will hurt both of us i need to protect asia i cant lose myself i have to endure it i turned around to asia after ma king up my mind i grab onto her shoulders and then opened my mouth but asias skin is soooooft asia listen carefully i will tell you about having a bath together more importantly since you are a girl if a guy enters the bathroom then you have to m ake sure you defend i kept my ambition inside myself desperately while being confused i need to tell her the action she must take when she encounters a guy in the bathroom door opens the door suddenly opens asia chan i will leave the towel here my okaa sama appears it seems like she is trying to put the towel on top of the washing machine but she froze her posture after seeing me and asia together holy shit i cant make any excuses since we dont have our clothes on no matter how you lo
ok at us we only look like a guy and a girl that is trying to have sex mum leaves the bathroom while moving like a robot then my mum shouts ootou san w we are going to have a grandchild i got out of the bathroom while being naked i used both m y hands to hide my face there is one thing i was thinking about while im running towards my room someone please kill me part 6 the next morning i called asia into my room we are sitting opposite each other in a seiza posture 4 listen up asia san yes ise san guys are wolves you will be eaten if you approach them carelessly men are werewolves that is scaryi sure wont be ab le to walk outside during the full moon then asia takes what i had said seriously i got a headache man im seriously getting a headache the day after the bathroom incident i started to give a lecture to asia about how dangerous guys are this girl is too defenceless well its not like asia had an ordinary life so it cant be helped if she is a bit different but
i have to tell her how guys my age are dangerous and that girls like her that isnt careful will become their prey easily if i d ont she wont be able to have a safe school life well if there are guys like that who approaches asia then i will beat the crap out of them no that wont be enough i need to teach her how her purity is something very important to her however shou ldnt it be girls teaching these things to other girls by the way after that incident my parents went to a discount store which is opened even at night they bought baby clothes and baby toys while putting on a big smile no matter how much i explaine d to them they simply said things like dont worry i know about it shotgun marriage are accepted nowadays oh my i sure would like a girl for my first grandchild or so i m going to become a grandpa if its a boy then i have to buy him a new c arp streamer looks like my family has become international now maybe i should learn how to speak english its useless my
family is worthless now getting back to the part where guys are dangerous i say it to asia again thats not it asia guys around my ageguys in their teens are very interested in girls its not an exaggeration if i were to say that they are always thinking about girls actually we think about naughty stuff every few seconds if there are days when we see a panty shot the n that will be a day to celebrate for us by the way panty shot is a phenomenon where we get a glimpse of girls panties from under their skirt do you also think about naughty stuff as well ise san yeah of course im also perverted you know that very well right asia yes asia replied with a smile theres a crack in my heart from her carefree smile i see so she knows im perverted yyeah im perverted guys like that are really scary thats why guys like that drag pure girls like you into a dark place and do something very bad something very bad asia tilts her head adorably man each of her actions is damn cute tthey touch your body then they touch your
body again then again they touch your body in other words they do indece nt actions towards girls its dangerous right scary right yes im scared but if i am in danger ise san will come and save me asia smiles and answers me like she actually means it my eyes are getting hot like i thought she truly believes in me im emotionally moved no no im getting off topic its not the time to be emotional i then continued after making a cough but asia you have to increase your awareness as a girl im really scared because you dont doubt other people you are scared ise san yeah i am if some guys do something to you when im not looking then i might kill those guys im that worried about you asia i told her seriously and sincerely asia is listening to me seriously as well since im putting on a seri ous face what i told her is my actual feeling if someone ever deceives and hurts asia then i wont hold back even if that person is a human im a devil i also possess an insane sacred gear even if im far superior
to a human i wont hold back my ang er even if buchou tries to kill me i will still beat the crap out of that guy thats how important asia is to me is it because shes a girl that is part of it because i like her that is also the part of it but more than that i changed her life dra stically i changed her life that she could have finished as a sister to a life that is the complete opposite of it i made her into a devil because of my own justice no my own selfishness at that time that may have been the best solution however i buchou isnt blaming me since she said to me i wanted to make her into my servant so you dont have to be concerned about it ise but thats wont be enough i need to look after her so she can live peacefully for the rest of my life that is i hyoudou issei need to protect asia argento for the rest of my life obviously i will also protect buchou but protecting asia may be similar yet a bit different yeah i need to
think about it carefully again protecting buchou i like buchou as a girl but i want to protect her since i also look up to her its similar to how a samurai serves his master you can say that its a similar feeling of a subordinate of a person who is aiming to reach the top protecting asia i like asia as a girl however i think its more like how a brother wants to protect his adorable little sister thats why im chasing away guys very strictly that are trying to get close to asia well since i dont have a sister i dont know if its similar or not except i also wa nt asia to get stronger as well so i can have a lifestyle where i can always laugh with her i understand i would definitely not do anything that would trouble you ise san thats why please teach me a more yeah i know but i think its better to be taught by a girl rather than a person of the opposite sex like me i will also talk to buchou and akeno san so just get used to the current lifestyle bit by bit
yes phew i sigh looks like it will work anyway i will talk to the girls from occul t research club once i get to school obviously i will tell them while hiding the fact about the bathroom incident then asia asks me a question uummise san theres one question i want to ask you asia got shy and her face got red what is it so a bruptly iif the bath incidenthappened with buchou san instead of mewould you have had a bath with her what i got speechless at a question i didnt expect to hear i never expected asia to ask me a question like this but asia has a serious fac e even though her face is red huh huh why did she ask me a question like that i dont get it why did buchou come into the topic however even if buchou was at that scene and she said the same thing asia did ise come over here i will wash your b ack ufufu are you feeling nervous its alright you are my cute servant so you can leave everything to me buchous slim white fingers touches my back i started getting excited
here turn around ara ufufu even though you are feeling nervous this thing down here is being so honest its just like you ise buchous hand reaches between my legs and then huh oh shit i was imagining something bad ah theres blood flowing out of my nose bbut if buchou did say that to me i wont know wh at to do can i wash your oppai buchou i may ask her that without feeling scared i can also imagine buchou allowing me to touch it while smiling damn it this imagination alone would be enough for using it for those kind of things i look at asia a nd her eyes are teary so thats it isnt it then its okay if its buchou san sobits okay i know i knew about it i already knew about it but still sob shes crying asia is crying why how i start to panic after seeing her geez what are you two doing early in the morning a familiar voice when i turn around buchou is sighing while wavering her crimson hair bbuchou a lovers quarrel in the morning you two are so close like always nno t this is
hurry lets go get re ady for lodging go where wait lodging buchou answers me with a smile we will go to the mountain to train part 7 hee hee im inhaling a lot of air while carrying a crazy number of bags yahoo yahoo i can hear someones echo damn it i t must be a mountain hiker they sure are having fun right now im in the mountains we were brought here by buchou after she said we were going to train buchou who suddenly came to my house this morning made me and asia pack our stuff the other memb ers were already gathered and we came here by teleporting from the magic circle the weather is so good that the sky is clear the surrounding is filled with trees and you can hear the cries of the birds in terms of viewing the mountain its incredible but the problem is this slope every step i take drains my stamina away and a lot of my sweat falls onto the ground hurry ise quick buchou who is way ahead of me urges me beside buchou is asia she is looking at me with a worried expression i
will help as well its okay since ise wont be able to get stronger if he cant do this much i can hear the two talking thank you asia and buchou you are cruel like always more importantly carrying this much luggage is impossible buchou th ey are too heavy i have a huge piece of luggage on my back i also have other bags on my shoulders they are my bags and buchous bags i also have akeno sans bag as well apparently this is also part of the training i think im going to die before i r each the destination whats inside this luggage buchou i gathered some herbs lets use it for the meal tonight kiba says that while walking past me with a cool expression hes also carrying a huge piece of luggage on his back i lost my words when i saw him walk up the mountains without any difficulty he has quite the amount of stamina since he also went to gather some herbs during our way here see you later then koneko chan who is carrying more luggage than me walks past me guha superhuman girl show her talent damn i cant
lose to them uoryaaaaaa i then went up the mountain at full throttle haahaaha shit im going to die im seriously going to die while repeating something like this over and over again we reach the mansion part 8 this mansion made from wood belongs to the house of gremory usually it is hidden by blending in with the scenery from humans by using demonic powers but it has appeared since we will be using it i can smell the scent of wood after getting inside i went to the living room to put the bags away and slept on the floor after drinking a glass of water the girls went upstairs to get changed into a clothing where they can move easier i will also go and get changed kiba went to a room located on the firs t floor carrying a blue jersey dont peek kiba says something messed up jokingly i will seriously punch you bastard i didnt have the strength to stand so i glared at him with e yes filled with killing intent geez if girls from our school saw us then they will cause an uproar again its already bad since the bl pairing
of me x kiba and kiba x me are getting popular lately 5 it got popular because it was the beauty and the beast pairing i dont understand whats going on in their heads wait that means that im the beast i wont forgive them i got changed at the empty room after i rested for a bit and my stamina restored a bit as well even the empty room comes with bed and equipment necessary for everyday use but it doesnt come with a television by the time i finished getting changed everyone has already gathered in the living room buchou who is wearing a red jersey smiles and says it after she sees me now then lets start our training outside right away life3 i started my training part 1 lesson 1 sword training with kiba yo ha orya oryaaa i was sword training with kiba and i swung down the bokuto at him kiba evades my attack smoothly no matter how much force i apply to my swings it doesnt seem like it will hit kiba bash kiba hit away my bokuto again thats not it dont just look at the opponents sword movements but also widen
your line of vision so you can pay see both the opponent and the surroundings its not that simple as he says so the more i practiced with kiba the more i realise the difference in strength bet ween us like i thought since hes a knight kibas techniques are overwhelming he beat me with minimal movements he has practiced for a longer time has more battle experience and more than that his talent at using a sword is much better than me we are not done yet here i come i realised once again on this day about how kibas sword technique is amazing lesson 2 demonic power training with akeno san thats not it you gather the demonic power by drifting the aura that covers your whole bod y you have to concentrate and feel the wave of demonic power i cant even gather demonic power into my hand at all even if akeno san who is wearing a black jersey is the one teaching thoroughly gunnnn concentrate i need to concentrate hard i have to gather the demonic power in my hand while imagining of creating something i did it asia who is wearing a white jersey
has gathered a mass of demonic power in her hands a ligh t green coloured demonic power so asias demonic power is green its beautiful ara ara so asia chan has talent in using demonic powers after all asias cheeks got red after akeno san give her complimented to her ngh i on other hand is the com plete opposite even the letter d for demonic power hasnt appeared i somehow made a really small sphere of demonic power but its not big like asias one that has the size of a softball instead it has a size of a grain of rice well if a sia can get stronger then thats fine ii have the ultimate sacred gear anyway hahaha now lets change those demonic power into fire water and lightning you can make this by imagining it however it will be easier for beginners to actually move fire and water using their demonic power akeno san sends her demonic power into the water inside the water bottle spike the water that received the demonic power formed into the shape of a spike and ripped the water bottle from the inside wow thats amazi ng asia chan i want
you to copy what i just did next ise kun i want you to continue on to concentrating your demonic powers the source of demonic power is imagination anyway its important to materialize what you imagined hmm imagining huh to ma terialize what you imagine in your head it may be easier to materialize what you are good at and what you always imagine more quickly thats what you say akeno san its not like i hmm i see something im good at and something i always think about huh ah then does that mean that wild idea of mine is also possible akeno san do you have a minute if i can make something i always think about into reality then i may become invincible wow thats awesome even i think this idea of mine is great after akeno san goes blank she smiles at me while saying ufufu that sure is something you would come up with ise kun oh so this may be possible then akeno san went back to the mansion she brings something and puts it in front of me she brought loads of onions carrots and potatoes they are the ingredients for curry now
then ise kun during our stay here i want you to strip all of these off with your demonic power ah i get it i understand what akeno san is trying to say and what she wants me to do looks like it will be a bumpy road ahead lesson 3 sparring with koneko chan nugagaaaaaa bang gufu today i succeeded in getting pushed into a big tree for the tenth time no thats not it i got blown away by koneko chans punch once again ku im frustrated weak a loli girl who is wearing a yellow jersey gives her harsh words to me shit im so shocked i felt it with the incident with riser but getting beaten by a small girl is quite a shocking experience for me koneko chan is a devil girl who is good at doing throwing moves pinning moves and other kind of martial arts shes insanely strong with the mix of a rooks traits of super strength and super high defense shes also keen because she has a small b ody so if i look away she will immediately be right in front of me and give a blow to my body
shes holding back quite a lot but it still hurts if im hit by her you have to aim at the centre of the body when you give a blow where you hit with a ccuracy and also by thrusting your blow deep into the opponents body even if she says that it will be hard for a newbie like me to even land my hit on the opponent koneko chan starts to whirl her arm around and pointed her fist at me now then well have another round looks like ill be killed lesson 4 with buchou hey ise keep on going osu im currently climbing up a very steep mountain with a big rock tied to my back on top of that buchou is sitting on top off the rock im rep eating a procedure where i climb down the mountain path and then up the mountain path the mountain path with no walking path is really exhausting by the time my legs got numb after i did dozens of laps buchou finally forgives me by saying okay we are done with this next is muscle training we will go with push ups yyes shes an oni an
oni buchou i lack the basic ability most so i have way more training than the other club members also for a pawn who has to run around the battlefie ld the most increasing your strength and stamina is an absolute requirement guwaa buchou mercilessly puts a rock on my backwhen im in the posture for doing a push up demonic power truly is useful because you can lift a rock up in the air with ease if only she used that to carry the luggage sit unn then buchou sits on top of the rock a slight force impacts my body now then the three hundred reps of push ups lets start osu i would have already died a hundred times if i w asnt a devil part 2 uoooo its delicioooous its really delicious we are having our dinner after finishing a day of training we have an extravagance of food on the table the herbs that kiba collected earlier was used for spices the meat dish app arently its the boar buchou hunted its my first time eating boar meat however it tastes good because it doesnt have any strange tastes to it the fish dish it
seems like buchou was also the one that caught these fish the simply cooked fish with salts sprinkled on them taste good as well there are also different types of food on the table ara ara we still have more food left so eat as much as you want the one who refills my rice is akeno san rather these foods are handmade by akeno san kaaaa its good its really good everyones digging into the food we are all seriously tired from the training after all and thats why i can fill my stomach with lots of food most of the things inside the luggage were equipment used for cooking it was wor th carrying all that luggage desperately from that hard mountain path if i got to eat delicious food like this i probably shouldnt say it out loud about how koneko chan is eating a lot of food quickly akeno san you are the best id even want you as m y wife ufufu you are embarrassing me akeno san smiles while she puts her hand on her cheek you look so good in that japanese apron i also made this soup huh the one who is
looking sad beside me is asia she looks like shes sulking the o nion soup that is on the table apparently asia was the one who made it she probably feels down because i only praised akeno sans food i get the bowl and drink the soup with one sip yup its good its good asia its the best give me another one it is im so glad then now i can become ise sans hmmm i couldnt hear the last part what was that nno its nothing asia waves her hand while her face becomes red huh what was she trying to say now ise from todays training what have you found out buchou asks me after drinking green tea i put my chopsticks down and give her my honest answer i am the weakest among us yes thats for sure i feel like crying after she answers plainly akeno yuuto and koneko ha ve lots of battle experience even though they have not participated in the game so they can fight if they get used to it but you and asia basically dont have any experience yet even so asias healing ability and your boosted gear is something
that can t be ignored even the enemy knows that i want you to have at least the power to run away from the enemy run is it that hard buchou nods at my question running away is also a part of the strategy retreating to form a new formation is also a professional way of battling there are ways to win a match like that however running away with your back facing an enemy is something quite hard if its an enemy with roughly the same strength as you it is easy but showing your back to an enemy who is far superior to you is basically asking them to kill you so being able to run away from such enemy will also be a part of your strength so i have to teach you and asia the time you have to run away of course i will also teach you how to fight the e nemy head on roger that yes asia and i reply to buchou at the same time its unavoidable that asia got involved in this fight since she became a member of the gremory group i also need to have the power to protect
asia as well in the worst case i will have to become asias shield that is the resolution i need to have lets take a bath after the meal its an outdoor bath so its wonderful with buchous words i started to think about naughty stuff bath outdoor bath the open ai r bath if its an outdoor bath then its a place to peek peeking is the right way for an outdoor bath yeah its a sin not to peek if you are born as a man im not going to peek ise kun kiba says that beforehand with a smile idiot d dont blur t it out oh ise do you want to peek at us while we are taking a bath everyone looks at me after buchous question uwa i feel awkward i feel like apologising for being a perv but buchou chuckles then how about you bathe with us i dont m ind what i can feel electricity running through my body ku buchou japanese is stunning like always i feel like crying all the time because of it how about you akeno i dont mind if its ise kun ufufu i might want to wash
a gentlemans back akeno san gives her approval with a smile i totally want her to wash my baaaaaack absurd its okay then its really okay how unguarded can the girls from this club get how about you asia you should be all right if its your beloved ise right asia got red and became quiet after buchous question but she eventually makes a small nod with her head uwah i never thought a situation like this would happen to me w wwwwwww what should i do i i im confident that i will have to bend my body f orward the whole time lastly koneko how about it no she rejects me n no my sensations paralysed for a moment but this is a natural response from an ordinary girl then its a no too bad ise buchou chuckles with a naughty expression what i feel as though they raised my hopes up then dropped me to the depths of the abyss becau se of the shocking conclusion my sight turns black sob i was so close so having a situation which is like a dream is hard to make into a reality after all then it looks like
i have to peek if you peek then i will hold a grudge against you forever guha koneko chan says that to me first shit its a no after all i had my hopes up isekun lets have a naked bath together i will wash your back shuuuuuut up ill seriously kill you kibaaaa my shout of anger echoes throughout t he mansion part 3 training day 2 when i woke up in the morning what awaited me was the intense pain of muscle aches thats because i also trained at night theres a training planned for tonight as well we are the residents of night after all bucho u said the training was much harder than the training i do every morning it has a few times more training than the one i did in the morning even if a devil is much stronger at night i would still die if i train both during the day and the night i was already in a bad mood because i had to share the room with kiba when i heard the girls voices having fun from upstairs i regretted being born as a guy then in the morning for day
2 it was study time we gathered at the living room and they apparently decided to teach me and asia about devils knowledge therefore they were teaching me some weird names that were hard to remember because i was taught things that i dont even understand my brain was about to get fried when they pumped quite a decent a mount of information kiba asks me a question our greatest enemy the angels led by god what is the name given to the highest rank angels also the ones among them ummm its seraphim right the members aremichael raphael gabriel and hmm uriel correct phew so its correct i remembered that they all have an el at the end of their name so somehow i remembered them all next is our maou sama what are the names of the yondai maou sama sure piece of cake im pla nning to meet them when i get a peerage so i remembered all their names perfectly lucifer sama beelzebub sama and asmodeus sama and lastly the female maou sama that i look up to leviathan sama correct im definitely going to meet leviathan sama i heard from buchou that the person standing
at the top of the female devils is the maou leviathan sama i also heard that she is a very beautiful maou sama i was also told that i could meet her if im lucky ku i cant wait how beautiful will she b e since she is a maou sama she must be very beautiful haa i really want to meet her then next i will ask you to say the names of the leaders of the fallen angels that you hate the most ise kun here it comes the names of those fallen an gels i totally hate the fallen angels have more leaders than the other factions and their names are complicated but i remember the names of the top two the main group of the fallen angel is called grigori the name of the governor is azaz el and the name of the vice governor is shemhaza i know completely up to here and the name of the leaders are armarosbaraqieltamiel ah and hmmm huh bene something and c c cociane benemue kokabiel and shariel you have to remember them properly this is also the basics its the same as remembering the names of the prime
minister and the vice prime minister of japan as well as the leaders of the surrounding countries how can i they have too many leaders two is enough what are the jobs of the other leaders then man thats why fallen angels are such a pain i cant come to like them they are probably scum anyway also they watch over the children of god in other words the sacred gear possessors twenty four seven thats also the reason why i was attacked and why asia was killed once the fallen angels made a group to research the sacred gears they invite beneficial sacred gear possessors to their group or take their sacred gears for themselves if they arent beneficial then they kill them on the spot seriously they are the biggest scum ever they even kill those possessors that do not know about their own sacred gear thats how it was for me they seem to be the greatest enemy of the devils so i won t hold back on them i wont hold back on those guys who did such a terrible thing to asia like this i was taught about the angels and the fallen angels its
becoming quite useful to know i need to remember especially about the relation between the de vils and other factions since they are important then next asia starts her lesson cough then now i asia argento will explain about the basics of the exorcists oh clap clap i give a clap to asia who is about to speak in front of everyone ah she turns red thank you very much for such a cute response uumm from the place i used to belonged to there were two types of exorcists two types asia nods at my question the first type are the ones that appears in films and novels the father rea ds a section of the book then he uses the holy water to get rid of the devil from the persons body they are the exorcists on the surface so the exorcists on the behind are the ones that are a threat to us buchou continues from where asia left of f ise you have also met him before but the greatest threat to devils are exorcists who received the divine protection from a god or the fallen angels we have been fighting against them for a very
long time behind the scenes they come to destroy us wi th the power of light received from the angels and with their physical bodies that they trained to the uttermost limits then i remembered the crazy priest boy from before he was a crazy exorcist with white hair he not only kills devils but also those who have connections to a devil to tell the truth hes the type of person i dont want to meet ever again while i was thinking about it asia takes out loads of stuff from her bag buchou picks up a small bottle with water inside it with her fingers and is holding it as if she is touching something disgusting now i will talk about the traits of holy water and the bible first of all the holy water it will be very terrible if a devil touches it thats true so you cant touch it as well asia your skin will get harmed sob thats right i cant touch the holy water any more asia gets shocked after hearing buchous comment well she is a devil after all i will tell you how to make one afterwards i dont know if
it will be useful b ut there are a couple of ways to make them maybe this is her strong field so asia continues to talk energetically yo devil priestess shell probably cry if i say such a thing i need to control myself next is the bible i have been reading it every day since i was a child but im in trouble now because it gives me a pain in the head even if i only read a sentence of it you are a devil you are a devil after all a devil ufufu devils receive intense damage sob i cant read the bible any more asia starts to have teary eyes after everyone points it out to her i heard from buchou before we devils suffer greatly if someone reads out the bible to us i havent experienced it yet but i may suffer because of boredom if someone rea d it out to me wait so that means asia has been reading the bible if she continues she might die one day however this is my favourite phrase oh god please forgive a sinful person like myself who cant read the bible au she received damage
a gain by praying to god please god just ignore this childs prayer like this after we finished our morning study session we went onto our evening training part 4 there were a few things i found out while training like this with everyone for several day s in this mountain i have no talent in using swords i have no talent in martial arts i have no talent in demonic power and the most crucial one is that i am insanely weak i realize how small i am the more i train with the others i wont be useful i n the game yeah i dont have a healing ability like asia what im doing all right is peeling off the vegetables well that is also a part of the training imso weak and so useless part 5 that night at the mansion im looking at the ceiling whi le lying down on my bed a week has passed since we came to the mountains its been training from morning to night we also repeated many offense and defense formations as well as combinations that we may use for the upcoming game i look towards kiba wh o is
sleeping on the bed besides mine hes sleeping peacefully kiba is amazing i realize the difference between us the more we train together ill probably never beat kiba in a sword fight the skills he attained with his own talent and loads of training i dont have either if i train hard from now on will i have swordsmanship on par with kiba after how many years will that be no after how many decades no maybe i wont reach his level in eternity i in demonic power training asia keeps on improving hers besides me she starts to master using fire water and lightning despite it being small but i on other hand can only make a mass of demonic power that is the size of a grain of rice i ah damn it i cant resist it any longer so i go t up from the bed slowly and headed towards the kitchen when i was drinking a cup of water ara youre awake buchous voice came from the living room when i look there is buchou who is sitting by the table ah buchou hello why are you so stif f good timing lets talk for a
bit the tealight makes a faint glow on top of the table devils can see at night even if there are no lights thanks to that we were able to train even at night then this candle is used probably for looks then i then sit opposite of buchou where we have the table between us buchou is wearing a red negligee while wearing glasses and tying her crimson hair into a ponytail huh buchou do you have bad eyesight oh this its just for looks i can think more clearly while having my glasses on fufufu this is the proof that i have been in the humans world for so long buchou chuckles even buchou with glasses looked beautiful more like she also looks wonderful when she wears a negligee on the table there are loa ds of papers that looks like a map and battle formation was she making a plan by herself at night buchou closes the notebook with different strategies written on it to be honest the only thing i will get by reading this is to have a peace of mind buchou says it while making a sigh why is that if the opponent is
another high class devil then we could fight by reading this this book is written with lots of research but that isnt the problem then whats wrong riser himself no the biggest problem is that our opponent is the phoenix buchou takes out a book after answering me and puts it on the table she then points out at the opened page there is a picture of a fire bird with its wings spread wide open heroically a long time ag o the mystical beast phoenix was looked upon by humans as a bird that governs life it was so looked upon that it left its legend in many countries in the human world where its told that the tears of the phoenix can heal any wounds and the blood that f lows within its body can give eternal youth to those that drink it but there was also another clan that is different from the mystical beast phoenix they are the devils that had the rank of marquis and were counted as one of the 72 pillars the phoe nix from the devils side the humans named the devils phoenix as phenex to distinguish it from the mystical beast
phoenix however the mystical beast phoenix has the same ability as risers clan in other words immortality thats the opponent we mu st fight against immortal h hold on thats cheating i mean being immortal is basically being invincible yes they are basically invincible even if you attack them their wounds will heal right away their flames wont even leave a bone left eig ht wins and two losses this is the record that riser has at the official rating game he fought ten times and won eight matches he lost two of the matches on purpose as kindness to one of the households he is close to in reality he won all of his matc hes he already became a candidate to obtain a title in the official game what i lost the words from my mouth i now understand what buchou meant by problem its riser she is thinking of a way to beat that bastard i felt something uneasy when i heard that riser was chosen as my fianc yes i think otou sama and the others chose him in case something like this was to happen they chose riser so i will have no choice but
to marry him even if it becomes a match between households they knew that there was no way for me to win in chess you would say they tricked me a swindle no matter how strong buchou is her parents knew that there was no way that buchou could beat someone immortal thats unfair then no matter whose daughter it is they can t avoid getting married when the rating game became popular the ones who climbed up the most is the house of phoenix there werent that many battles among devils until the game was introduced in a game where the king also participates the strength of phoenix became clearer the house of phoenix is the leading group among the strongest class immortal devils realized how terrifying this power was for the first time if they are immortal then they can resurrect no matter how many times they are d efeated the other devils have limits to their powers unlike the phoenix so they would get defeated once they get exhausted uwa they are so insanely strong that its unfair and that is our opponent even if we defeat risers servants the beauties arm y it doesnt mean anything
if we dont defeat riser no the question is can we even defeat him it wont be a fight where they planned to cheat to beat us would it buchou chuckles after looking at my serious face you know its not like we cant defeat riser are you serious yes there are two ways you can defeat him one is to beat him down with incredible power and the other one is to keep on taking him down until his mind crushes the first method requires the strength of a godclass the se cond one is to save our stamina until riser gets his mind crushed even if his body is immortal where he can resurrect his body many times his mind isnt immortal his mind will definitely tire down every time we defeat him its our win if we completely crush down the phoenixs mind then he will stop resurrecting and he will fall well the easiest way is to defeat him with a power that is on par with god that crushes him down with one strike which takes down both his body and mind wont both methods need a lot of effort to pull it off is
it even possible to do something like that in our first battle no we have to do it in other words we have to fight until he says i resurrected so much that i lost the will to fight so please forgive me oh yea h i will ask her the question that has been bothering me this whole time buchou what is it why do you hate riserno more like why are you against this marriage buchou sighs at my question certainly riser seems like scum and is quite the woma nizer but i think she cant reject this arrangement if you think about buchous house problem im a gremory huh w well you certainly are no i didnt re introduce myself im a devil from the house of gremory and that name will follow me t o wherever i go oh i think i get it do you hate it i feel proud of it however this is also something that is a burden to me everyone looks at me as rias from the gremory i cant have them look at me simply as rias thats why im enjoying my li fe in the human world they dont
know about the gremory the devil everyone looks at me as who i am i really like that feeling i never felt something like this in the devils society and i never will now on as well the only time i can enjoy my life as myself is when im in the human world buchou has a distant look she also has very sad eyes she told me a story of the world that i can never imagine im hyoudou issei and i never felt anything to my name i am myself im just the son of my mum and my dad right now wherever i go people looks at me as hyoudou issei as an individual buchou has been spending her life while carrying the name of gremory on her back that will be the same from now on i want to be with someone who will love me as ri as without the fact that im a gremory thats my small dream i have unfortunately riser only looks at me as rias from the gremory and he loves me as rias from the gremory thats why i hate it but still the pride of being a gremory is
very important my feelings may be complicated but i want to cherish this small dream i have so buchou wants to be loved as rias and not as rias gremory from the opposite sex thats what you call a maidens feelings huh but theres no doubt that buchou is feel ing complicated because of her houses problems hmm i dont understand both the feelings of a girl and the structure of the devils society so i dont know what to say to her i like buchou as buchou i just said what i thought but buchou stares at me in wonder i dont know anything about gremory or about the devils world but to me rias buchou is rias buchou nggh i dont understand all the complicated stuff but to me the usual buchou is the best i said everything i can think of with a smile hahaha i cant even say things that sound romantic hey buchou sama i dont know why but buchou has her cheeks red bbuchou d did i say something weird i ask her with a dubious voice but buchou shakes her head where she says i its nothing while panicking what did something happen
well ill leave that aside but having an opponent like that for the genius buchous first match it certainly will be a hard obstacle right i dont actually like the word genius buchou answers me stil l with a red face why is that a talent that is given by heavenit feels like its a gift given by god so i dont feel good my talent is born from the roots of the house of gremory that has been passed down to the generations i inherited that trait as a devil i never thought that i received it as a gift from god and thats impossible my power belongs to me and the house of gremory thats why i wont lose i will win if i have to fight i have to win buchou says it to me as if she was saying it to herself amazing buchou is really strong compared to that i i buchou im worthless i have been uselesssince i got here buchou makes a dubious expression while looking at me said that in a weak voice ise i think ive gotten stronger sin ce i came here and trained with everyone but more than thati
felt the difference between us if i do sword training i realised how amazing kiba is and realised that i wont be able to become a swordsman like kiba when i do the training for using de monic power i realise how superior akeno san is while asia is improving her demonic powers and i cant do anything im fine as long as i have my boosted gear i acted tough by thinking like that i have so many tears flowing out from my eyes without realising it im frustrated just frustrated the more i train the more i realise how weak i am i have no talent for battle i have come to realise it i found out that i was the weakest i also found out thatim the most useless i realised it means nothing if im the one with the ultimate sacred gear thats why i was laughed at by riser back then right pearl before swine certainly a fitting phrase for me i start to shed lots of tears in front of buchou im having so much tears from my e yes due to this frustration that it makes me look pathetic even my nose is
dripping buchou stands up and sits next to me hug buchou hugs me gently she starts to pat my head many times you want confidence right okay i will give you confidence but now you have to rest your body and mind i will be with you until you feel like sleeping that time i didnt know what she meant except buchous warmth is healing my soul that is enough for now part 6 use your boosted gear ise next day bucho u says that to me before the start of the training she is allowing me to use my sacred gear that i was forbidden to use since i got into the mountains she is allowing me to use it nowbut what does she want me to do with my sacred gear it should be ok ay to have yuuto as the opponent yes kiba comes forward after buchou urges him he stands in front of me hey is she telling me to fight kiba ise activate your sacred gear before the mock battle lets seewe will start the battle two minutes after you activate your sacred gear yyes i make my boosted gear appear on my left arm
just like buchou orders me to boost boost the sacred gear makes a sound at my words and i can feel the power coming into my body with this my power has doub led ten seconds later boost my power doubles again the power i can feel from my sacred gear runs through my body its all right that my power is getting doubled but there are things that i need to keep in mind when i use my boosted gear you may t hink there are no limits to my powers increasing but the truth is that isnt the case once i activated my boosted gear to see how far i can increase my power but after a few minutes i fainted the reason is simple my body cant handle the power as it in creases more when i asked buchou afterwards for example think that you are a truck what will happen if you carry more package than the truck can carry it wont move right thats how it is thats how she explained to me the package equals my powers that are doubling if the quantity of package keeps on doubling then the truck will decrease in
speed and by the end it wont move so in other words if the power gets too big then it puts stress on my body thats why i fainted my body which is a vess el wont be able to withstand the increased power thats what happened when i activated it for a few minutes the jewel in the gauntlet made a sound which said burst then my body got heavier and it felt like all my senses froze even if there are no li mits to the sacred gear the user which is me in this case does have limits thats my sacred gears weakness well its more like my weakness its not the sacred gears fault i got my twelfth power up after buchou ordered me to power up then buchou or ders me to stop my sacred gears power up lets do this boosted gear explosion this sound also represents the stop of the power up and acts as a stopper once the power up stops i can fight with that increased power for a certain time the leng th of time i can use it depends on my action during the power up the more i
move and the more i attack it minimises the time this also affects my stamina and if im in a tired state then the time will also be shorter one of the ways to use this sacr ed gear is that i dont receive any damage yeah thats why my current state where i have no damage and have full stamina is the best time to use the ability of my boosted gear my power is increasing while during the boost but it is unstable compared to the time when i stop the boost to use the power up for a limited time if i move around too much there are risks that it may change me back to my normal self for that reason its better to stop the boost then use the power up it will be wise to run ar ound and hide while getting a boost now my power is in an unthinkable state because of the two minutes boost the power i feel within my body isnt normal ise i want you to fight yuuto in that state yuuto i will ask you to be his opponent yes bu chou kiba makes his stance by
pointing his bokuto toward me after buchou ordered him ise do you want to use a sword or do you want to fight with bare hands buchou asks me how i will be fighting hmm even if i have a bokuto i wont be able to use it i will fight bare handed very well now then ill ask the both of you to start i also make a stance against kiba well its a newbies stance swish kiba suddenly disappears from my sight oh crap the trait of knight is speed kiba has god speed once i lose sight of him i will receive the attack bang kibas swing came down at me but i guard it by using my arm yes i can withstand this kiba makes a shocked expression he let his guard down i punch towards kiba who stopped moving swift kibas body disappears just before i hit him and my punches cut through the air crap he dodged it wheres kiba i try to chase him by looking around hes gone if he isnt in front of me or to my left or right then hes behind me however i dont see kiba when i
turned around above me when i look up kiba is coming down with his bokuto aimed downwards bang i heard a nasty sound guhaaa i receive a blow on my head it huuuuurts ouch i dont have time to touch the part i was hit and i release a kick towards kiba who just landed on the ground swish he dodged it again shit it wont hit at all if my opponent is a knight then will i have a hard time with their speed ise shoot with block of demonic power when you form a b lock of demonic power shoot it with a shape you imagine the most buchou gives me an order a block of demonic power i have to do it here i dont know if it will hit but theres no other choice i will obey buchous order i gathered the demonic power flowing within my body and concentrated it into my palm there is a block of demonic power that is the size of a rice ball small like usual i then shoot it towards kiba that instant i wasnt able to believe what i saw guoooooooooo its huge the magi c ball that
had the size of a rice ball got bigger when i shot it it reached the size of a huge rock this i get it its the power of the boosted gear the huge block of magic got closer to kiba the velocity was quite fast as well swish kiba dodges it easily well thats not surprising oh but it wont mean anything if it doesnt hit thats what i thought but soon i got rid of that thought the demonic power ball that missed its target went towards the mountain next to the one we are on and baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang the mountain blows up while making a huge sound and blast eh eh eeeeeeeeeeeeh a single shot of demonic power i shot out blew away a single mountainthe mountain has a huge hole in it it changes the view of it eh are you for real it actually blew it up its a mountain you know a mountain because of the sudden turn of events i didnt know what to say reset the gauntlet made a sound and i can also feel the power leaving my body at the same time looks like the time im powered up for is
finished then i lost all of my strength at once it feels like my insides became empty seems like i used up my demonic power ill have both of you stop it there buchou ends me and kibas spar kiba also put his bokuto down i a lso sit on the ground as if i lost my strength tthe mountain disappeared my heart is beating with that fact d did i do that i still cant believe it a an attack like that actually came out from my hand good job you two now i will hear your impres sion yuuto how was it kiba answers buchous question yes to tell the truth im astonished i tried to finish the spar with the first strike eh the first strike as in the one i was able to block but i couldnt break through ise kuns guard i wa s focused into breaking through it i also tried to knock him down in my second strike by hitting his head from above the air but that failed as well kiba answers it while laughing out hahaha with a refreshing expression kiba put his bokuto to the fr ont to show it
to everyone that bokuto is already broken i strengthened the bokuto with demonic power but it couldnt give that much damage to ise kun because his body was too hard if we continued i would only have the option to run around because i wouldnt have my weapon thank you yuuto thats how it is ise thats how it is is this the thing she told me yesterday when she said ill give you confidence ise you said to me that you were the weakest and have no talent right yyes thats half correct you who hasnt activated your sacred gear is weak however you become a totally different person if you use the power of the boosted gear buchou points at the mountain that was blown away that attack is one of a high class de vil if that hits most people will be blown away are you serious well it certainly does seem like an attack that could blow most beings your body which went through basic training became a vessel that can handle a sacred gear that increases the powe r drastically even now your body is strong enough to handle the power increase i told you
before right you can become the strongest as long as you improve your basics the higher your initial strength is the more the power can increase the basic sta mina rises from 1 to 2 even something like that would become a big factor for you to become strong my power is amazing i still cant believe in myself and buchou says it with confidence to me you are the key to the game ises attack becomes the factor that decides the outcome of the battle if it was only you fighting then it would be scary because you would have your guard down while powering up however this battle is a team battle you will have your comrades that will support you trus t in us then you will become strong as well as us we can win this become stronger me lets show it to those that looked down on you it doesnt matter if the opponent is phoenix or not we need to teach them very strictly in how strong rias gremor y and her servants are yes everyone replies to her with a strong voice thats right i have buchou and everyone with me i will
become strong i will become stronger along with everyone i will defeat riser phoenix after having new found determinat ion the mountain training went through smoothly then we reached the day for the decisive battle life4 the decisive battle begins part 1 on the day of the decisive battle im ready im getting fired up in my room right now its 10 o clock at night the decisive battle will start in two hours at exactly 12am today our job as a devil is off we went home straight after school thats because we may end up wasting our stamina we plan to meet up at the club room 30 minutes prior to the match so i can only stay here for about 90 minutes but still i feel the most relaxed here in my own room so i want to stay here as long as i can if i go there i will feel nervous whether i like it or not ah i feel more nervous than the time i was waiting for my entrance exam results to our academy im wearing my uniform i thought this will be the most fitting clothing for this rather should i prepare
clothing for battle purpose when i asked that to buchou if my group has a uniform then it has to be the uniform of kuoh academy we are the members of the occult research club after all buchou replied like that to me with a smile thats why my battle uniform will be my school uniform well if i was doing martial arts i could have prepared a dougi there are lots of banana peels near me i ate all of them already and that technique that i have been practicing ever since camp is almost completed i can do this i can do this my new ultimate technique knock knock someone knocks on the door huh is it asia isesan may i come in yeah sure i get a bit shocked when i witness the clothing that asia is wearing thats because she is wearing a nun outfit obviously she doesnt have her rosario hanging around her neck she also doesnt have her veil on her head asia that outfit yyes when i asked buchou san she told me wear something that you feel the most comfortable in i thought about it a lot and i found out that
this outfit is the easiest for me to move around in im not a christian anymore but i havent forgotten my beliefs even though im a devil now is that so this girl must have thought deeply about it im sure that you need a lot of guts to appear in a nuns outfit for a battle between devils but if thats wha t asia chose then i dont have any complaints buchou will also allow it with a smile yeah you look the most natural in a nuns outfit you also look good in our school uniform but you were dressed in that outfit when i first met you yeah you look gr eat thank you very much asia makes a very happy face when i praise her uumm ise san asia suddenly becomes hesitant whats up with her can i sit beside you yyeah sure asia approaches me who am sitting on my bed and then she sits beside me she then hugs onto my arm tightly wwhats wrong i panic but i can feel her shaking through my arm i cant stop shaking when i think that there is a scary battle waiting for us but if
ise san is with me i will be okay asia ehehe im not scared if im with ise san after all can i stay like this until we leave sure can i stay with you forever from now on yeah we will always be together i hold on to asias hand gently and we stay like this till we left the house after t hat i didnt feel nervous anymore and asias shaking has also stopped part 2 around 1140pm at night the other club members and i have gathered in the old school building we are waiting in our most relaxing positions everyone except asia is wearing their uniform kiba is equipped with a gauntlet on his hands and has some armour on his lower leg he has his swords against the wall koneko chan is sitting on the chair and is reading a book on her hands she is wearing gloves that allow her fingers to be seen its one of those gloves that martial artists wear it looks pretty intense if a girl with a loli face wears it akeno san and buchou are drinking green tea elegantly just to be expected from our onee samas they
sure are calm asia and i sit on the chair quietly while we wait for the time to come ten minutes prior to the match the magic circle glows and grayfia san appears from it is everyone ready its ten minutes before the match everyone stands up after grayfia san confirms us grayfia san then starts to explain about the battle when it becomes the time to start the battle you will be teleported to the battlefield through this magic circle the location of the place is in a different dimension used for battles you may fight with all your power its a disposable space so feel free to fight to your satisfaction i see a battle purpose field huh so devils can prepare something like that as well indeed if we fight somewhere in the humans world or devils world we cant avoid dest ruction so it means that we need a place where we wont harm anything no matter what we do but leaving that aside theres something that im concerned about hey buchou what is it buchou you also have another bishop right where is that pers on yes thats what buchou told me before she reincarnated
asia she told me she already has another bishop she told me that the bishop is doing another mission but why isnt the bishop here under this serious situation after i asked the questi on everyone except me and asia acts weird it seems like i asked something i shouldnt have it feels like the atmosphere in this room has changed all of them are keeping their mouth closed unfortunately the other bishop cant participate though th ere will be a time when i will talk about that in the near future buchou says that to me without looking at me in the eyes seems like theres something complicated about this matter i probably should stop asking about this topic now but whats so impo rtant that the bishop cant appear for its masters important match i cant get rid of my suspicions grayfia san then speaks under this weird atmosphere this rating game battle will also be viewed by members of both households from a different loca tion through broadcast are you serious so they will be watching us so they are going to view us like vip members huh they sure must be having fun since buchous parents
are watching this as well i cant show them an unsightly scene maou lucifer sama will also be viewing this battle please do not forget about it maou maou sama wow that makes me nervous even the one standing above us is paying attention to this match buchou then makes a shocked face onii sama is i see so onii sama i s also going to view this battle huh i think i heard it wrong what did buchou just say o oniisama i got confused so i put my hand up and ask uumm buchou you just called maou sama onii sama did i hear wrong but kiba answers me straigh t away no buchous brother is indeed the maou sama what mmaoooooou buchous onii sama is maou sama yes buchou confirms it straight away are you serious seriously no wait but buchou is part of the gremory clan isnt she i think her last name is different from any of the maous last names lucifer beelzebub leviathan and asmodeus it doesnt match with any of their last names are you confused because buchous family name is different to the names of maou samas kiba guesse s what im
thinking its a bummer but he has it correct yeah thats it kiba starts to explain after i admit it reluctantly in the previous great war the maou samas were in a critical condition and have passed away a long time ago but there would be no devils if there arent any maou samas thats why the devils decided to keep the names of the maou and let them be inherited to the ones with enormous powers so the current four great maou are the ultimate class devils that are the successors of t he first generation maou that have inherited their names so thats how it is then lucifer and beelzebub isnt a personal name but more like a managerial position to tell you the truth out of the three factions of the god the fallen angels and the devils the devils have the least power we are actually in a tight spot but we are still safe because the current maou samas have powers equal to those of the previous maou samas so the devils society is just somehow managing huh im pretty shock ed to hear that the maou samas that have their names recorded in the
books you find in the libraries are already dead so buchous brother was chosen to be a maou from the ultimate class devils then kiba nods at my question sirzechs lucifer who is als o known as the crimson satan he is buchous brother and the most powerful maou sama sirzechs lucifer not a gremory but a lucifer huh so he isnt referred by his family name any more like buchou is so thats why buchou needs to inherit her h ousehold it cant be helped since her brother became a maou her brother has to carry the world of the devils on his back amazing even buchous family is amazing its about time everyone please head to the magic circle we gather to the magic circle after grayfia san urges us to also once you get transported you can not use the magic circle until the game ends so we can only return here after the outcome the magic circles symbol changes to another one which is not that of the gremorys and it starts to emit lights its also not the symbol of the house of phoenix perhaps its the one used for the game while i was
thinking about it the light covers us and the teleportation begins part 3 when i open my eyes huh i tilt my head when i witness the view obviously because this place is the clubroom what the did the teleportation fail but everyone besides me and asia are calm and they arent even shocked about this situation we are in also grayfia san is gone dont tell me she telep orted just by herself then hello everyone i am grayfia a maid from the house of gremory and today i will be the arbiter of the rating match between the house of gremory and the house of phoenix school broadcast its grayfia sans voice in the na me of my master sirzechs lucifer i will be keeping my eye on this match by using both rias sama and riser samas opinion we created this battlefield which is a replica of the school kuoh academy which rias sama attends to in the human world what t then this clubroom is a replica its exactly the same the location of the furniture and even the scratches on the wall is the exact same so it really has a high reproduction of the
real thing oh hold on if i look out of the window the sky is white its supposed to be very dark since its midnight so did they make a replica of the school in this world of white just how extraordinary can the power of devils be the location where both teams were transported will be their base rias samas base would be the occult research cubs clubroom located in the old school building riser samas base would be the student councils room located in the new building for the pawns to use promotion please head to the enemys base to do it thats me so i cant promote unless i go to the enemys base due to the trait of my role using promotion is absolutely necessary similar to the actual chess promotion is a special move you are able to do if the pawn reaches the furthest part of the enemys base i can change into any pieces besides the king piece so i have to reach the enemys base no matter what student council room huh its at the corner of the highest floor in the school building i have to head there likewise risers pawns
can promote if they get here unlike us where i am the only pawn they have 8 pawns if they all turn into queen we are in deep shit queen is the ultimate piece its certain that we will be in danger if they are to promote its normal for pawns to be sent first so they can take down each other does that means i have to take down 8 beautiful girls of pawns all by myself wow i have rough roads ahead of me everyone will you all please put this transceiver in your ears akeno san gives ev eryone an earphone type transceiver buchou says it while putting it in her ears at the battlefield we will be using this to communicate with each other so we will receive the orders through this transceiver huh this is an important item i need to m ake sure i dont break it now its the time for the commencement of the battle also this match will continue till dawn in the humans time so game starts now ring ring the school bell rings so this is the ring to signify the start of the match huh like this our
first rating game begins part 4 first we have to take down risers pawns it will be troublesome if they all promote into queen buchou says it while sitting on the sofa shes quite confident akeno san starts to prepare tea u umm we are in a middle of a match you know bbuchou you seem pretty calm ise the battle just started the rating game is originally a game that doesnt finish in a short time there are times when it becomes a blitz but mostly its a game t hat takes very long just like the actual chess game iis that how its played i thought it will be like those battles you often see in films something like those ultimate fight between monsters types of things the rating game has a meaning only if you use the battlefield to the fullest usually the base would be a fortress a castle or even a tower there are forests and rivers between the two bases and we battle using those areas this time the school is our stage yuuto yes kiba spreads a map on the table after buchou urges him wow the whole map of our school its
divided into grids and there are english alphabets and numbers on it oh i get it its broken into grid that is similar to a chessboard buchou draws a circle around the old school building and the new school building with a red pen oh i see she marked our base and the enemys base theres a forest near our base its safe to assume that this is also our territory in other words the new school building would be risers t erritory its quite possible that there will be an ambush when you enter their territory the school field is visible from the new school building so its dangerous to pass through here she is right the school field is visible from the new school buil dings windows once we enter the battlefield its impossible to teleport using the magic circle so its impossible to teleport from the old school building to the new school building so we have to use our feet to move around then well we can use our wings to fly but we will become a sitting ducks also i cant fly yet then do we have to go through the sports ground to get
to the new school building buchou chuckles at my question normally yes but the enemy will also know that so hell have h is servant positioned at the sports ground hell have his knight or rook positioned at one of the clubrooms located in the sports ground no if its a sports ground you will need a person with mobility so hell have one knight and three paw ns a total of four servants positioned here then hell have control of the whole sports ground then kiba says his thoughts buchou its about the gym near the old school building shouldnt we occupy this location first if we capture it here then w e will have a route to the new school building the gym is a passage to both of the buildings so we could also restrain the enemys movements buchou nods at kibas opinion yes i also have the same opinion first we will capture the gym in terms of location the opponent may have his rook positioned there since its inside a building it would be better to use the rook with destructive power over knight with mobility wow they started to talk about the strategy in
a way that i dont unders tand w well ill just follow the order i just need to make sure that i dont cause any trouble for them yuuto and koneko you two set a trap in the forest take another map with you and make sure you mark the places where you set the trap in i will make a copy afterwards and hand it to everyone yes roger koneko chan and kiba leaves the room straight away and takes a map and a weird looking tool box with them everyone else will be on standby until they finish setting up the trap oh aken o yes after yuuto and koneko returns can you cast illusions and mists around the forest and the sky obviously a trap that only reacts to risers group thats how the start of the match will be like though it seems like this battle will become int ense midway through it so ill leave the issue regarding the mists and the illusions to you akeno i understand buchou akeno san confirms the strategy has already begun both asia and i dont know what we are supposed to do uumm buchou what am i supposed
to do i think its bad if i dont do anything i want to do something yes ise you are a pawn so you have to use promotion yes i reply to her energetically buchou waves her hand towards me hmm what is it sit here i sit next to buchou because she told me to she then points at her lap lay down here wwait is thatthe legendary lap pillow ii can reallyuse that white legs of yoursam i really allowed to do it ii will be in your care i unconsciously bow my head to buchou politely gulp i start to put my head on buchous lap slowly while gulping down my saliva touch i can feel a really soft sensation on my cheek ooooooooh why are you so soft buchou my head is about to explode because im having lots of physical contacts with buchou her actions towards me are too great for someone like me who am going through that age i want to grind my cheek on her lap but i think my heart will stop uuuu i have tears on my eyes without even noticing it lap p illow out of all the things
i want to get done by a girl its definitely among the top 10 and right now it became a reality i cant stop the tears that are falling from my eyes man what am i doing in the middle of an important match but a pervert ed student like me who has no luck with girls is getting this sweet treatment oh mum and dad thanks for giving birth to me buchou sighs while looking at me geez why are you crying sob getting a lap pillow from buchou im so moved that the tears wont stop i will never forget this sensation sob im happy that i was born if its just lap pillow then i will give it to you again you seriously are an overreacting boy what t this is absurd you will why is buchou so nice to me no thats not important now so something like that is possible yes ill ask her myself next time aah my school life is so wonderful im totally in a league over motohama and matsuda now i feel sorry for them i just need to hope that their life will get better ah asia is looking at
me with teary eyes and she is making a weird face huh is she angry why she looks very unpleasant touch buchou then puts her hand on my forehead i u nlocked a small portion of the seal that i had cast on you huh seal the moment i say out the doubt i had there is a big change in my body heartbeat at the same time i can feel a power growing within me what is this amazing it feels different t han the power up that i get from my boosted gear if that is a power i receive from elsewhere then this power up is coming from within me and it feels comfortable what is this buchou then says it my ear while i find it suspicious do you remember the talk about where i used all my eight pieces of pawns to reincarnate you yes at that time your strength as a devil was low so i had to put a limit on your power as a pawn you who just reincarnated from human didnt have a body that could endu re the power of eight pieces of pawns to put it simply you would
be the strongest after akeno so you needed to attain more power or else your body would break so i just unsealed a bit of the seal unsealing it then this power that is flowing withi n my body is my natural power that training was meant to have you cope with the power of boosted gear and the pawn though there are areas you still lack in so there was actually a meaning to that harsh training im glad that i went through that tra ining by training hard pat pat buchou then starts to pat my head aah it feels so nice to have onee sama pat my head is it me or is asia looking at me with sharp eyes listen up ise you have to beat your opponent even if they are girls okay you ca nt hold back they wont hold back against you yyes i understand thats a good boy use the promotion to change into queen the battle will change if you promote into the queen that possess the strongest power but it feels weird for me w ho am a guy to turn into a queen buchou makes a small laugh at
my opinion its just a name for a role in chess so you dont have to think too deeply about it we are already at a disadvantage by having fewer members than riser so you have to prepa re yourself to work over the limit if we lose even a single person our situation will get even harder buchou already thought about our roles carefully and has already made a plan for our move the battle can be settled if i charge up my demonic power with my sacred gear and shoot it to the new school buildingthough it wont be that simple right the opponent may also foresee such method and they may have a counter measure against it also there is a limit to my attack which has powered up and since im bad at using demonic powers i cant do something like wasting it if i have to do it it will be safer to promote to queen first that way you can guarantee the power of the attack yeah i will just go forward while believing in buchou an d my comrades buchou i will definitely make you win thats what i thought from the bottom
of my heart my true feeling yes its better to tell her my actual feelings buchou smiles after hearing that yes i will be relying on you my adorable ise i will definitely make buchou win i wont give buchou to a jerk like that like that i was having fun with buchous lap until kiba and koneko chan got back thanks to that im fully pumped part 5 alright i raise my spirit in front of the old scho ol building next to me is koneko chan she will be my partner for the next plan okay then ise koneko you wont be able to avoid the battle once you get into the gym move accordingly like we discussed that location will be an important place bucho u sent us off at the entrance koneko chan nods at buchou yes i will our target is the gym we need to win the battle that will be awaits us the ones that will be heading there is me and koneko chan we are not allowed to fail yeah we cant lose i cant retire without even using promotion then i will be going as well kiba is getting ready to
go by placing his sword to his hip yuuto move accordingly like we discussed roger that asia will be on standby with me but we will be going aft er we get a signal from ise and the others you definitely can not be taken down it will be over if we lose our healer yyes asia also replies energetically even though she is nervous asias ability to heal is our lifeline because of that ability of hers we are capable of doing things that is a bit recklessly for our strategy our winning factor is to protect buchou who is our king and also asia akeno i trust you to move when you think its the right time yes buchou the strongest servant akeno san according to buchou the outcome will be decided with her move i will be relying on your ultimate move that is hidden behind that smiling face of yours buchou steps forward after she checks everyone now then my adorable servants are you r eady we cant turn back now our enemy is riser who is said to be a genius from the immortal house of the phoenix with a promised career now then lets
go and blow them away yes all of us replies together and heads off me koneko chan and kiba l eaves the old school building isesan everyone please do your best i can hear asia cheering for us from behind we raise our hand and wave at her now theres no more turning back hyoudou issei i will have to be resolved and move straight ahead we run towards the gym during our way towards the gym kiba leaves us to head to a different direction its in our plan for kiba to leave us at a certain point then i will be waiting for you ahead yeah you just do that we split up after saying our good byes he will do his job and i will do mine i went towards the gym along with koneko chan since the main entrance is connected to the new school building we cant enter from there thats because our intrusion will be caught by them we need to go in from the other door located on the opposite side of the gym we went there and turn the door knob its opened its not locked but this gym even the appearance
of it looks like the actual thing its the same with the old school building where it lo oks like the real thing i will believe it if they tell me afterwards that the stage took place at the real kuoh academy we come into the back platform from the back door since the curtain isnt down the inside is visible i try to look at the court f rom the corner of the platform but then koneko chan mutters presence enemy even before i can get shocked at hearing that a loud voice echoes within the gymnasium we know you are there servants of gremory we watched you coming inside the v oice of a woman risers servants so they saw us coming inside then there is no need for us to hide ourselves koneko chan and i show ourselves to them by appearing at the platform boldly there are four female devils standing at the court the woman wit h a china dress the twins and also there is the loli girl who knocked me down with a stick i never thought i will meet her this quickly if i remember right the woman with the china dress
is the rook the twins are the pawns and the small girl is also a pawn i know it because we were explained about the enemies while having the photo of them shown to us at the clubroom before we came here three pawns and one rook we are also a pawn and a rook though their numbers are double of ours though due to our plan we cant avoid this battle boosted gear standby boost the boost begins yeah im going to do it i will leave the pawns to you ise senpai i will take care of the rook yeah both koneko chan and i stand in fro nt of our opponent the china dress woman makes a kung fu stance and the small girl makes a stance with her stick lastly the twin girls grabs their chainsaws with a smile hey a chainsaw drill drrrrrrrrrill the chainsaws starts while making a danger ous sound wow are you serious girls arent allowed to carry dangerous things like that disassembling time both of the twins say that happily hey you cant say things like that with a bright voice more like i dont want to be disassembled it will
be bad if i get hit by those chainsaws bang bang koneko chan and the china dress woman have already begun their fight a bit further away from us it looks like a martial arts match because of all the punches they are throwing at each other each hit looks powerful since both of them are rooks i think koneko chan is at an advantage because of her small build which allows her to move more freely but the china dress woman is also moving swiftly while doing tricky attacks swish the pawn girl spins the stick professionally while making a sound if my memory is ri ght i think her name is mira then i get a nasty flashback i acted all mighty and ended up getting hit by that stick without doing anything i dont want to lose ever again split split split split split the twins come right at me while grinding their chainsaws to the floor the chainsaws are making sparkles and they swing them at me drrrrrrrrill i can hear a nasty sound near my ear wow thats dangerous i was just able to dodge it i tackle one of the twins with my shoulder
and put some dist ance between us if its a simple move like this then the boosted gear wont reset if i get too carried away and attack them the power will return to the original state swish a sound of something being pointed at me from behind wow i also dodge th is attack by a margin as well the stick passes through my armpit sharply its an attack from the girl called mira i dodged it this time my body can move more than i thought it was because of the training and also because buchou unsealed some of the po wer of the pawn pieces inside me i can do this i can actually do this i have confidence in my own power when i showed some confidence the chainsaw grazes my cheek from the pain i felt its certainly bleeding when i look carefully my uniform is c ut in different places ugh looks like im in a pretty dangerous situation boost the second power up the girls still doesnt hesitate to attack me during the boost but yo haa i dodge the attacks that are coming from above me by moving my body t o
the side and i dodge the attacks coming from the side by jumping and ducking down i guard the attacks of the stick that is coming from the front by crossing my arms yeah i overcame all of their attacks hows that dammit ah geez this is so frus trating why isnt it hitting him the chainsaw twins seem pissed so they start to step on the floor violently i cant break through his guard looks like the stick girl is also irritated that her attacks arent hitting me effectively too bad i also trained like hell as well i wont be able to face buchou and the others if i lose instantly boost here it is my third boost its here lets do it my sacred gear kun explosion i will fight them in this state my whole body is getting overflowed with power a powered up state for a temporarily time i wont waste it even for a bit i will take care of you two first i run towards one of the twins fast it may be weird coming from me but thats a good dash the opponents cant react t o my movements for a slight
moment she swings her chainsaw after she realises the situation she is in but my fist has already reached her bang one of the twin pawns went flying with my hit you how dare you hit my onee chan the little sister of t he girl i just hit aims her chainsaw towards me but i twist my body and hit the girl the younger sister of the chainsaw twin falls down to the floor haa the stick girl with a childish face thrust her stick towards me i will make sure it works this t ime daa break i cut down her stick with my karate chop ouch the stick is harder than i thought i hit away the girl who just lost her weapon without a moment to spare kyaaah the young girl rolls on the floor while making a scream ku the soun d of the china dress woman when i look the china dress woman has her hands on the floor and koneko chan is still maintaining her fighting stance wow i can tell that koneko chan is at an advantage by the looks of it geez if we lose to a guy like him riser
sama will get mad at us one of the chainsaw girls fixes her position and makes a negative comment we will definitely dissemble you into pieces the twin turns on their chainsaws once again fufufu you wont be able to act in such way any longe r i already accomplished the necessary conditions for activating my ultimate technique take this my new ultimate technique dress break click at the same time i click my fingers the chainsaw twins and the stick girls clothes gets blown away yes even their underclothes are blown to pieces the white curvy bodies of the girls are exposed right in front of me wow all three of them still need some growth but this is also wonderful in its own way bubah lots of blood bursts out of my nose while i make a laugh loudly nnoooooooooooooooooo their scream echoes within the gym all three of them ducks down to the floor and are trying to hide their private parts ahahahahaha hows that this is my technique and the name of it is dress break i just kept on imaging the girls clothing getting blown away into pieces i spent all of the talent i
have in making a technique that will make all of the girls naked yes you can say i spent all of my talent i have in using my demonic power for this reas on i dont have talent at using demonic power in the first place so i just turned what im good at imagining into reality by using up all of the talent i have this was all for this scenery i am seeing hahaha look i stripped down the girls naked thats why i peeled all of the fruits and vegetables with not my hands or a knife but with my demonic powers only i peeled the vegetables and fruits till i would lose my mind the activation requirement is that i have to touch my opponents then i send them my demonic power that is filled with strong imagination and this is the result you are the worst you are the enemy of every woman beast you sex fiend the chainsaw twins starts to bad mouth me while having tears in their eyes i will gladly accept those words i misjudged you stab koneko chans muttering i heard from far away impales my heart then i heard
a sound from the transceiver i have on my ear ise koneko can you hear me its me buchous voice it seems like koneko chan al so heard it yes both koneko chan and i are safe more like we are doing well right now thats good to hear but akenos preparation is also completed i want you two to move accordingly with the plan buchous order i nod after exchanging a glance with koneko chan dash koneko chan and i went to the central entrance while ignoring the girls who are down on the floor are you running away this location is supposed to be a crucial place risers servants become shocked by our actions yeah you a re right this certainly is a crucial place a location that connects the old school building with the new school building in chess it will be the centre its apparently very important thats why both sides came here to obtain this place thats why there is a meaning to this to make this place as our decoy koneko chan and i leaves from the central entrance flash an instant flash then dooooooooooooo a huge lightning falls down onto the gym with
a sound when the lightning stops the gym that is supposed to be in front of us gets wiped out take akeno sans voice when i turn around i can see akeno san with a smiley face that is flying through the air with her black wings spread she has her right hand raised upwards and her hand is spark ling with electricity riser phoenix samas three pawns and one rook retire grayfia sans voice who is the arbiter echoes through the battlefield wait so with that attack just now the enemies koneko chan and i were fighting got defeated are you serious with that one attack oh yeah i heard this from kiba before the priestess of lightning thats akeno sans nickname since buchou isnt the age where she can play in the official matches not many people know about akeno san but she is fa mous among certain group of people ppriestess of lightning thats terrifying i will definitely die if i get punished with that attack yup i will make sure i dont make akeno san angry we did it koneko chan i try to put my hand on her shoulde r but she avoids me please
dont touch me she says that with a scorn voice and shes glaring at me ugh that reaction saddens me well it cant be helped for any girl to be alarmed at me if they saw a technique like that hahaha dont worry i wont use it on my comrades even so it is a very low technique oh my looks like she hates me for real now everyone can you hear me akeno did a perfect attack and finished it with this the first phase of our plan is completed i can hear bu chous voice from the transceiver i have in my ears she sounds really happy buchous plan that is to destroy the gymnasium that was thought to be a crucial point also destroying it along with risers servants koneko chan and i went through the back do or of the gym to enter but we did this act while knowing that the enemies were watching us we needed to have them battle us by making the opponent come into the gym as well we simply needed to flee after we fight them for a certain time after that ake nosan destroyed the gym with her lightning
from the sky we were a bait to make the enemy come inside the cage then we the bait left the cage and destroyed it along with the prey buchous plan has succeeded to throw aside the important location and u se it to attack is something to be reckoned with defeating one rook and three pawns was a big plus we still havent lost any of our members so we started off with a good start that lightning takes time to charge it to use for the second time after she uses it so using it continuously is impossible though the enemy still has a greater number than us we will also head out as soon as akenos demonic power recovers so i will leave the rest to each of you till then so please move on to the next pha se yes so buchou and asia are heading out me and koneko chans next move isto regroup with kiba and defeat the enemy located at the sports court it happens then bang a sudden explosive sound is made nearby when i look at where the sound came f rom k koneko chan koneko chan is lying on the
floor a bit away from me while smokes arise from her i went to her quickly and hold her koneko chans uniform is torn as if she was dragged into a bomb there are parts of her uniform that are gone do nt tell me that explosive sound before is take an unknown voice when i look up there is a shadow up in the air flying with its wings spread its a woman dressed up as a mage and wearing her hood its risers servant so risers servant did this t o koneko chan im sure that is risers queen the sudden appearance of the strongest servant fufufu when you hunt a prey the best time to take them down is when the prey accomplished something because thats the time when the prey is the most vulner able its enough for us to sacrifice many of our pieces in order to take down one of you your group has a small number of members to begin with that alone will be enough to give a huge damage to your group right even if you defeat us you can not def eat riser sama its useless to resist the magician
woman laughs as if she finds it amusing ise senpai akeno senpai koneko chan speaks with a voice that is about to disappear im sorry i wanted to be of more use to buchou and everyone yyou dont have to apologise we were doing our job its not a problem just wait once asia arrives she can heal you koneko chans body gets enveloped with light the body starts to fade and then it disappears from here rias gremo rysamas rook retires a cruel announcement buchou explained it to me before when we take a certain amount of damage and get into a condition where we can no longer fight we retire and get teleported out of the battlefield by force the destination is a place with medical equipment thats why its alright even if were hurt badly its not like we will die so risers servants that akeno san defeated and koneko chan were teleported there i know i know that in my head this is a match but still i i i can feel the weight disappear from my arms damn it damn it my body shakes with anger come down heeeeeere ill be your opponent i ignored
about the next plan and started provoking the enemy who defeated koneko chan even i know its a foolis h act but i still cant forgive her koneko chan was crying just before she disappeared she was crying because of regrets she was still able to fight shit if i had realised it much earlier i may have been able to save koneko chan i was getting ahead of myself because the first plan succeeded fufufu what a noisy pawn boy do you want to explode like that girl from before the mage put her hands towards me im going to get shot ara ara i will be your opponent riser phoenix samas queen yu belluna san or should i call you the bomb queen akeno san comes between us as if she is trying to protect me i dont like that name because of its bad taste priestess of lightning though i was hoping i can fight you isekun meet up with yuut okun i will take care of here bbut i try to convince her but akeno san shows a serious face to me for the first time my heart races i can feel the extreme pressure from
her isekun you have your own role correct go then this matter here is my job thats right i might just be a burden to akeno san i need to focus on what i need to accomplish akeno san smiles at me who am biting down my teeth hard its okay i will avenge koneko chan i will defeat this queen with everything i have a golden aura covers akeno sans body i can tell how powerful she is just by looking at it akeno sans demonic power that is the strongest person in our group our queen akeno san i will leave this place to you after i say that i turn around and head towards the sports court where kiba is waiting for me right after that a violent roar of lightning and explosions echoes from behind me the battle changes from the opening to the mid game life5 high praises during the d ecisive battle part 1 it happens during my way to the sports court where kiba is waiting for me riser phoenix samas three pawns retire its the announcement three of risers pawns were defeated who did it im still on my way to the
destination akeno san is battling the queen and buchou and asia are on their way hereso it must be kiba with this seven of their pieces have been defeated with this they have nine members left including riser we only have five members left with koneko chan gone its a situation where we still cant let our guard down someone grabs my arm while im on my way to the court an enemy i make my stance but the one who is holding my arm is kiba hes putting on a refreshing smile like always oh its you yup kiba is observing the sports court from behind the storage room which is a blind spot from the court sorry kiba koneko chan is i know it since i heard the announcement as well she must be feeling regrets i never knew what she was always thinking about but she was really pumped for this match she was working hard when we were setting the traps in the forest lets win of course ise kun we hit our knuckles together kiba pisses me off during our normal school life but he i s the most dependable ally in terms of battle
occult research clubs male pair if we dont show guts right here then we will look totally uncool in front of the girls also was it you who defeated the enemy pawns kiba nods at my question yeah t he clubroom located at the sports court is an important location so its natural that there are lots of enemies i somehow managed to lure the pawns that were keeping their eyes over there and took them down but the person in charge of this location is quite calm and hasnt responded to my provocation well it seems like she used the pawns to watch my attacks seems like riser phoenix likes to battle by sacrificing his servants its something only he is able to pull off because of his immortality an d the number of servants he has kiba is smiling but his eyes arent the enemies who are in charge of here are one knight one rook and one bishop three pieces in total thats a severe defence well thats how much they are keeping up t heir guard for this place against our intrusion here that is since we eliminated the gym they will put more strength here
the two routes that were seen as a path to the bases the route from the gym and the route from the sports court that is behind the new school building buchou chose to destroy one path so the only place they need to guard is this sports court so it will be natural for them to increase the strength here well because of our plan earlier it ended by making their queen come to the front lines looks like the battle at this place will be more intense than the one at the gym ugh im getting a bit nervous are you nervous kiba asks me with a smile it makes my face red oof course i basically have no battle experience and now im here in an actual battle i would be a grunt compared to you who is full of battle experience i have the powerful boosted gear that will be enough for me to be a threat but the wielder which is me is still a newbie in terms of battle its l ike a waste of treasure but still i want to fight for buchou i want to do something for buchou even if im
a weakling on this battlefield i wont go down without a fight if im going to get defeated i will at least take many opponents down along wit h me look while i try to make my determination strong kiba shows me his hand kibas hands are shaking isekun you said i have a lot of battle experience thats certainly true but its my first time participating in the rating game a serious battle between devils even if this match is a special case it doesnt change the fact that its a serious fight we get involved in devils fights whether we like it or not and this is our first game we cant show them even a slight opening in our guar d this is a match where we have to give it all we got as buchous servant devils its something that will be important even in the future i feel delighted and also scared i dont want to forget the feeling of my hands shaking this feeling of being ne rvous this intense atmosphere i want to feel everything and turn it into my experience lets become stronger together ise kun kibahas been thinking that much about
this match like i thought in terms of battle hes then lets do a combination that would make the girls get aroused hahaha does it mean that im the one who goes from behind dumbass if its sticking in then its my job i mean no die handsome i totally got dragged into his pace ugh what am i doing then i hear a lo ud voice of a brave woman im the knight of riser phoenix sama karlamine ive become bored of trying to sniff through each others strategy rias gremorys knight i challenge you to a duel at the baseball court there is a woman cladded in armou r who is standing at the centre of it daringly what a bold female knight she cant complain if someone shoots her from the back fu kiba who is standing next to me laughs since she introduced herself i cant hide myself both as a knight and as a swordsman after he mutters that out he leaves from behind the storage room he then walks straight to the baseball court that idiot even though im complaining i also follow after kiba by heading there from the front he looks cool
thats what i thought after observing kiba from his back im the knight of rias gremory kiba yuuto im the pawn hyoudou issei kiba and i named ourselves to risers knight carlamaine the female knight then makes a happy face im happy that there are wa rriors like you two in rias gremorys group coming out here directly from the front thats something people with normal sanity wont do so we dont have normal sanity huh but i love idiots like you two now then lets begin carlamaine draws her s word out from the sheath kiba also gets ready to draw his sword out the match between knights i have been waiting for this personally i would like to fight in an intense sword fight kibas aggressive words oh my kiba is making a really lively sm ile well said rias gremorys knight carlamaine starts to slash as if she is dancing gin the swords hit each other making sparks they both have god speed because they are knights they started their battle exchanges of swords that i cant follo w with my eyes they both keep on appearing and disappearing due to their high speed so what am
i supposed to do hmm i will be killing the tension if i help kiba no matter how you look at it this is a one on one fight hmm maybe i should give h im cheers like go kiba or you can do it kiba you seem bored when i look at the direction where the voice came from there is a woman wearing a mask that just covers half of her face im certain this woman is a rook then another person ca me while complaining geez this only seems like a mud fight since both of them only thinks about swords swords and swords carlamaine was making a bitter face when the pawns were being sacrificed so does she hate the battle strategy planned by her ma ster who happens to be her king furthermore when i thought i found a cute boy he also happens to be a sword freak so i cant stand this there is also a beautiful girl who is wearing a dress like the ones worn by western princesses i think she is risers bishop she has a drill shaped hairstyle on both sides she seems like a real princess wow im
surrounded by the devils that are in charge of this place the bishop princess looks at me with weird eyes w what is it hmm so this boy is the p awn that rias gremory adores does that person have bad taste in looking at gentleman she then starts to say rude things ku she has a bad tongue even though she has a cute face i take my distance from where i was standing and make a fighting stance a gainst the two boosted gear standby boost the sacred gear power up starts i have to leave the knight to kiba and take care of these two but the bishop girl just sighs im not going to be your opponent isabella why dont you be his oppone nt the masked woman who is called isabella nods obediently the girl wearing a dress moves away from us after she got a confirmation from isabella and is looking at us from a distance eh the drill roll haired girl isnt fighting i was planning to in the first place now then lets fight since we are both bored ah yeah thats okay but isnt that bishop going to fight its my
question to her thats because this is supposed to be an important fight right even i dont know how to react if she decides to withdraw from a fight like this hearing that question isabella san the mask woman put her hand on her forehead and make a troubled face ah dont worry about her that girl is special she will be mostly observing for this fight as we ll wwhat the hell is that words slips out from my mouth seriously cant you make a better excuse than watching this is supposed to be an important battle she is no that person is ravel phoenix riser samas little sister she became riser samas servant by using a special method but she is riser samas actual sister huh that beautiful girl that bird guys huh whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat the bird bastards sister waves her hand with a smile at me as if she reali sed that im in shock to find the truth hey is that even allowed he put his sister in his group and made her participate in the battle according to riser sama having your sister in your harem has a significant meaning you know the significant view of
having your close relatives you know how there are people who look up to and also get jealous about it well im not into little sisters so i have her in my group as fashion so that bird guy is really a perv and also a dumb ass but i thin k i know the feeling of having your little sister in your harem little sisters are good i also wanted one no thats not it fine then so that girl is his sister and she wont fight me huh now here i come rias gremorys pawn swift when i thou ght that the rook isabella came forward a really sharp punch passes through my cheek uwah lucky i dodged the attack by instinct i see so you can dodge a punch like this sorry i was looking down on you a bit ill put one gear no i will increase by two gears then isabella makes a suspicious move while moving her body but swish swish she starts to attack from unpredictable angles and places wow when i thought that i dodged her attack which she did by bending her arm it came back again li ke a whip
is this one of those flicker jabs you see in boxing it will definitely hurt if i get hit by it i cant attack unless i have my boosted gear to a certain degree for now i have to dodge i dodge the attacks like mad and then kick gah i suddenly feel an intense pain in my stomach a kick i was kicked i was too focused on her punches so i didnt pay attention to her legs i became unbalanced and more punches came at my face lots of her flicker jabs hits my face it hurts this is ser iously bad boost ku im sure that was my fifth boost this will be enough if my opponent is a pawn but this isnt enough to defeat a rook in terms of piece value rook is the next highest after queen i wont be able to take her down with h alfassed attacks i cross my arms to guard against her punches her punches are heavy even with my guard on i will retire right away if i continue to receive these hits i step back when she withdrew her fist the enemys attack stops but she is
still m oving i wont know when she will attack again im glad that i sparred with kiba and koneko chan that proved to be very useful thats because it gave me the sense to know when the opponent will stop attacking buchou also told me how to run so i was able to dodge the attacks just now then the rook isabella smiles i was taking you lightly to tell you the truth i thought i got you when my kick hit you looks like rias gremory has been training you well especially your stamina is magnificent stam ina did i do something amazing in a serious battle the most important thing is the stamina even idiots can fight but you need stamina to continue for a few minutes battles consume lots of stamina and concentration just dodging the attack requires quite an amount of effort so being able to do it till now means that you have been training your body a lot my heart becomes full the bitter training the shouts which made buchou seem like a devil i was forced to run from the morning and even ha d to carry rocks on my back in
the mountain path i thought i was going to die it even made me think if those were necessary but buchou stayed by my side from morning to dawn then my eyes got teary i start to shed some tears pathetically in front of th e enemy buchou buchou i am able to fight i am standing everything that you have done for me is showing results i cant lose i wont lose i will definitely make buchou win this woman i will defeat this rook who is right in front of me looks like i said something unnecessary i felt your pressure increase rook isabella i am the weakest and the least experienced member in rias gremory samas group but still i will defeat you it happens when i made my resolve buzz i heard the sound of the wind when i look i witness kibas darkness sword dispersing holy eraser a sacred gear where a darkness sword devours light and its blade is engulfed by darkness its kibas sacred gear but it looks like a part of it was blown away by the enemy knight unfortunately your sacred gear wont work on me carlamaines sword is covered in
flames a flame sword so the darkness sword got beaten by that huh but kiba doesnt seem bothered by it and instead makes a smirk then i will also tell you this unfortunately this isnt everything of my sacred gear what nonsense knight of gremory its unsightly for a swordsman to freeze after kiba says that with a small voice there is something gathering in the blade less sword huh it feel s like it has gotten cold chills starts to gather around here when i was feeling something like that kibas sword starts to freeze the ice starts to pile up and it takes the shape of a sword break at the same time with the sound of ice breaking kib as sword forms into a blade of ice in front of this sword flame delete all types of fire will disappear iice sword hey hey hey hey the darkness sword isnt the only weapon of kibas everyone except kiba has a shocked expression thats o bvious is it even possible aabsurd are you telling me that you have two sacred gears carlamaine swings her flame sword to the side she has an impatient look break break break the
instant carlamaines sword touches kibas sword the flame sword starts to freeze and turn into a solid then it makes a sound and breaks then it disappears but she doesnt stop attacking as soon as she throws away her sword she takes a short sword from her hip she then put her sword up and shouts we are the m embers of the all mighty house of phoenix that rule over fire and wind taste it the whirlwind of fire buuuuuuurn there is a wind of fire around the baseball court with carlamaine and kiba in the middle of it the hot wind is burning my skin that car lamaine has she forgotten that her allies are here as well isabella comments while using her arm to guard her face kibas ice sword starts to melt after receiving the wind of fire even so kiba still doesnt seem to be bothered i see you are tryi ng to burn us with the whirlwind of fire but kiba put his blade less sword in front of him he then says it with a strong voice stop suuuuuuuuck the wind is getting sucked into kibas sword while making a large noise the
wind stops within few seconds and the baseball ground becomes silent repression calm its been a while since i last showed more than two demonic swords for one battle there is a unique looking blade in kibas sword there is a mysterious whirlwind in the middle of the blade the winds were sucked in there he can even make that kind of sword as well multiple sacred gears are you a sacred gear possessor who takes the weapons of other sacred gear users and makes them his own kiba shakes his head at carlamaines questi on i dont have multiple sacred gears i also dont take the sacred gears of others and make them my own i created them createdthem yes sword birth i can make any type of demonic swords that is the name of my sacred gear and its true abilit y multiple swords appear from the ground when he put his hand downwards there are swords with different shapes even the blades are different from kibas words all of them must be demonic swords boost here it comes one hundred and fifty seconds exact now im also ready when you form a block of demonic power shoot
it with a shape you imagine the most what buchou said comes back to my mind the easiest way for shooting a block of power for me is how the main character of dragon ball son g oku shoots kamehameha boosted gear explode explosion a massive load of energy waves gathers on both my hands i spread my arms across and put them together i imagine how i will shoot it and then shoot it out by feeling the energy flowing wit hin me but i need to hold back the power that destroyed the mountain is bad it may affect buchous strategy if i destroy the school building i shoot it while holding back my special move dragon shot i scream the name of my special move inside mys elf since the enemy may predict what im about to do by hearing it don a mass of demonic power gets released from my hands guwah i get pushed back because of its power i continue to look at the dragon shot even though i get myself pushed back its huge even if you compare it to my body its about five times the size of my height and that
is heading towards my opponent really fast my target is risers rook buchou told me that in a rating game rooks are the most troublesome ones their a ttacks and defences gets higher these are the rooks traits and that is what their most terrifying aspect is its normal to give the role of rook to someone with high attack and defence but it is also used in a different way you can also give a role of rook to someone with high speed or high demonic power people who fight using demonic power tends to have weak physical builds so they used the trait to overcome their weakness so if you give the role of rook to someone with fast legs they will turn into allrounder type with fast legs high defence and high attack furthermore rook has a special ability similar to the promotion of a pawn the castling they can change the position of themselves with the king immediately buchou told me this is the most troublesome technique it doesnt do anything after checkmate but swapping the position of the king and rook is certainly powerful increasing their strong points or covering their weak points is up
to the master there are so ma ny ways of using the pieces thats why i will take on the rook isabella isabella dont take it dodge risers knight carlamaine shouts isabella who was trying to take the attack before changes her action by evading it pass isabella just dodge s my attack my dragon shot that misses the target went far away its heading for the tennis court the next moment baaaaaaaang the sound of the ground rumbling a red glow of light and whirlwind hit us i look at the dragon shot that had hit the tenni s court and i cant believe what i am seeing its gone the tennis court along with the surrounding sports grounds is gone did it get blown away with my attack even if it is a replica the school looks totally different from before there isnt even a trace left of the tennis court instead there is a huge crater i hold back yet this destructive power i realise it once again my sacred gear is abnormal isabella defeat that pawn that boy that sacred gear has the power to change the outcome of the battle by following the shouts of
carlamaine risers rook isabella locked on at me affirmative boosted gear it will become a big threat if we allow him to use promotion i will take him down before that happens its different from befor e isabella my current attack power is that of a high class devil the enemy came rushing in at me starting to kick and punch i guard them and put strength in my left arm daa my knuckle went towards isabella she crosses her arms and guards but bang my heavy blow breaks the guard and sends the masked rook flying yes i touched her i can use it now burst dress break pop that moment isabellas clothes gets blown away her naked body becomes visible wow those are huge oppais its real ly good since her body is tight i have saved it in my brains memory what what is this isabella reacts by hiding her private parts well of course you will react that way here it is without wasting anytime i put forward the small block of demonic power that i created with my right hand what i imagine is a block of demonic power launching from my hand i shoot
it towards the enemy goooooo shooooot the mass of demonic power that has been powered up significantly with the gauntlet went forward ku with a move like this the waves of demonic power cover the naked isabellas body baaaaaang a big shock wave spread throughout the area when it calms down isabella who is on the ground starts to get covered with light she starts to fade away an d disappear from this place reset the effect of boosted gear runs out then riser phoenix samas rook retires i heard the announcement of grayfia san hell yeaaaaaah i shout with joy because i defeated a rook i can fight i can fight becau se of you buchou part 2 i try to inhale some air after the fight with isabella i used quite a lot of stamina and demonic power in terms of demonic power i used my potential energy within me so the stronger the attack the more exhausted i will get i guess it will be good if i can release two more shots of demonic power which has the same strength is the one i just shot no after my second shot theres a threat that my
demonic power will run out and i may faint due to it i need to think that i on ly have one more shot left risers knight carlamaine smirks after losing isabella apparently both isabella and i have been taking that pawn and the boosted gear lightly just like i thought i shouldnt take him as an ordinary pawn the enemy p raises me this doesnt feel bad at all i feel a bit happy but its an awful attack no i should say its a scary attack b blowing away a womans clothes yeah im truly sorry i will apologise as well im sorry for our ise kun being a lecher like that kiba apologises to carlamaine why are you apologising i feel complicated carlamaine says it while holding the short sword with the other hand but a demonic sword wielderwhat fortune i may have a destiny of meeting swordsmen who wield special swords kiba seems quite interested after hearing that hmm so there is someone besides me who uses demonic swords no it wasnt a demonic sword it was a holy sword everyone here realises how kibas expression changes after hearing that instantly there is a load of
killing intent coming out from kiba wow what killing intent it feels really cold my whole body feels cold kiba asks with a low voice while having cold eyes tell me about that holy sword wielder what intense force he has the same level of hostility as buchou when shes pissed holy sword what does that have to do with kiba hmm seems like that swordsman has some connection to you but since we are swordsmen talking would be rude i will answer you with my sword is that right if your mouth can move then it wont be a problem even if you turn into a state where you are on the verge of death chills there is killing intent between the two the killing intents are so strong that it is making me shake as we ll kiba what happened to you your usual refreshing smile is gone someone approaches me while im feeling nervous at kibas change so its here huh wheres isabella neesan dont tell me she was defeated lots of risers servant girls starts to gather i remember their faces there are two pawns one bishop and one knight herehey its the gathering of the
remaining servants what the are they trying to pull off a massive battle here there are only me and kiba from our group aken osan is probably still fighting the enemy queen there are still lightning in the sky buchou and asia are yeah what happened to those two they should be moving ahead from the base according to the plan hey the pawn kun over there risers gi rl calls me what is it riser sama said hes going to fight your princess one onone see there the girl points very high at the sky when i look in that direction there is a shadow with fire wings and a shadow with black wings above the rooftop of th e new school building no matter how i look at it the person with black wings clearly has a crimson hair that is buchou isesan can you hear me ise san asias voice comes out from the transceiver asia what happened is it about buchou yes r ight now im with buchou san on the school rooftop the opponent riser san challenged buchou to a duel and buchou san accepted it thanks to that we were able to get into
the school building without any problem what kind of thing is happening im m aking a clueless face and risers sister comes to talk to me with a slim grin seems like onii sama made a challenge since rias sama was doing well in the battle unexpectedly it would have been our win if we fought normally so he gave her pity at this rate she will be defeated before you fight him his sister starts laughing by putting her hand on her mouth where the sound of her laughter went as hohoho im starting to get pissed buchou is strong akeno san will also come here as soon as she def eats the queen kiba will also defeat all of the servants here with his demonic swords combo i will also use my boosted gear and the crimson hair ruin princess priestess of lightning sword birth and boosted gear just hearing the names gi ves me chills but your opponent is the immortal bird no matter what kind of power you have it means nothing against the immortal bird but the phoenix also has weak points his sister laughs at my argument with her nose are you going to
beat hi m until he loses the will to fight or are you going to defeat him with a strike that rivals god are you trying to win this match thats a laugh why is it thats because there was no chance for rias sama to win from the beginning thats how much despair the thing immortal is to you risers sister makes a click with her fingers the servant devils surrounds me carlamaine i will leave that knight boy to you but if you lose we wont fight in one onone we will defeat him together or are y ou trying to lower the name of phoenix carlamaine agrees to risers sisters words reluctantly sieris affirmative the one who steps forward is a woman with a wild appearance she is carrying a sword on her back she is onii samas other knight unlike carlamaine over there she doesnt have any of that honour of a knight she will defeat her opponent just like that the woman called sieris draws her sword from her back its a big sword its really wide will i die if i get cut by that thin g but she can do the finishing ni
and li nya nya nya the one who responds to her words are two girls with beast ears i think they are pawns they are female beast warriors their hand to hand combat is remarkable you know swish the two be ast girls disappear from my sight then i receive a blow on my stomach and head guhaa without a time to whine i start to receive blows in my legs arms shoulders back everywhere in my body ii cant see their fists what speed bboosted gear boost the boost starts but the enemys attack increases more ni li boosted gear is a sacred gear that doubles the power every ten seconds from how the chainsaw twins ile and nel were defeated you wont be able to take him after he gets his thir d boost finish the fight within twenty seconds due to his sacred gear ability he cant fight when he increases his boosts he will just run away aim for his legs also dont touch his hands it seems like that person has a shameless move that blows awa y clothes by touching his opponents after hearing that the twins make an expression of fear thats low
beast shut up whats wrong with it whats wrong with obtaining a move that strips down girls naked its vulgar to think with your lower b ody whats wrong with thinking with my lower body im a guy well it may be pointless talking back at them but risers sister she understands my weakness very well bang ouch shit they are aiming for my legs now they low kicked me in my calves does a beast girls kick hurt this much are their basic physical bodies high because they are beasts i cant attack recklessly while the boosted gear is doubling my power starting from one where i dont have any time to spare will be the worst scena rio i have to run and evade bang ouch another low kick it hurts its not only that my legs are shaking because of the pain with this i cant run away guhaa i receive a heavy punch in my face my blood comes out blood blood from my mouth and nose tears starts to come out because of the pain isekun shit when kiba sees my situation he holds the sword with two hands and starts slashing so he can
defeat carlamaine quickly carlamaine hold it for another ten seconds i know that you cant win against that knight but we will be able to defeat the dragon user shortly keep that knight busy risers sister laughs with enjoyment are you just observing like a king she truly is a bitch stomp finally my legs cant move anymore m y knee hit the ground crap i dont have any strength left in my legs my head starts to get heavy as well i take too much damage shit if i faint now i will retire i dont want that i dont want to lose while not being of help to buchou baaaaaaa ng a shock wave shakes the whole field i look up because i thought it might be and it was buchou and riser fighting they are clashing against each other by using their crimson demonic power and fire demonic power up in the air riser doesnt even have a scratch even his clothes arent ripped and buchou on the other hand has some parts of her uniform burnt i think she is breathing heavily as well thats because there is no chance for rias sama to win from
the beginning thats how much despair the thing immortal is to you the thing that risers sister said earlier crosses my mind lose us buchou is what will happen if we lose then buchou willwith him that that i wont forgive i have to stand i have to stand even if my body gets turned into meat is it because i like her thats part of it love is a part of it but more than that i have to protect her i want to protect that person its not about the contract or constraint that person needs to stand strong while wavering her crimson hair thats buchou thats the person who i came to admire buchou told me she doesnt want him buchou told me to fight then i i just have to fight hey red dragon emperor san answer me if you can hear me give me strength boosted gear dragon b ooster my sacred gear makes a red light its not enough this isnt enough i want more strength more that time it was asia now its buchou answer my feelings boosted geeeeeear dragon booster second liberation the gauntlet makes a sound tha t i have never
heard before and there is a change to my left arm the red aura covers my left arm and it shapes into something the gauntlet starts to change its shape and form when the aura disappears the boosted gear it changed the gauntlet which was said to be a crystallisation of insane power changed into a new form the jewel that is on the hand part of the gauntlet also shows up on my arm therefore it has changed the overlook of it huh what is this im wondering about it and th e jewel sends the information to my head so thats how i use my new power a smirk appears on my face naturally on its own i can we can still get stronger kibaaaaaa i put all my strength to my legs and got up haha i can hear screams from various places in my body but keep moving for a bit more my body and i sprint i sprint towards kiba release your sacred geeeeeear kiba seems confused at my shout but he put his sword on the ground and howls highly sword birth ping the ground glows and lots of demonic swords appears its here
i thrust my fist on the glowing ground and shout boosted gear the second ability with the power i increased with my sacred gear i send the power to the ground there is only one target kibas ab ility to create demonic swords boosted gear gift transfer ping the sound of metal rumbling violently echoes through the area all of the sports court becomes a sea of swords there are different shapes of swords in various places where the blades are directed towards the sky the whole area becomes like a display area of demonic swords all of them are the demonic swords created by kiba the second power boosted gear gift the effect is to send the power that i boosted with the gauntlet to othe r people or objects and increase its power drastically i sent my power to kibas demonic swords through the ground and this is the result it increased the power of creating demonic swords and the area around us became a field of blades impossible are you telling me this is also the power of the dragon risers servants blurt out their anguish that cant be helped their bodies are penetrated by the many
sharp swords that are sticking out from the ground then their body starts to glow and disa ppear from the battlefield they are retiring riser phoenix samas two pawns two knights and one bishop retire yes i make a victory pose after hearing grayfia sans announcement with that attack it took down a large number of their serva nts i can do it we can do it with this new power gift buchou akeno san and kibas power will increase oh yeah we can even enhance asias healing ability yes with this new ability we can defeat riser isekun im surprised this power kiba looks around at the various demonic swords with an awestruck look he seems surprised since his ability did more effects than he thought yeah kiba i used the gauntlet to strengthen your that instant an announcement which we cant believe is revealed rias gremory samas queen retires what kiba and i cant believe our ears of course i cant believe it aakeno san that cant be akeno san is the strongest out of us baaaaaaaang the ground vibrates violently and i hear a familiar no ise the sound came from where kiba is when i look
in that direction timidly i lost my words kiba our knight is on the ground with smoke coming out from his body there is blood around him even without any time reaching him his body gets covered w ith light and he disappears rias gremory samas knight retires another unbelievable announcement echoes through the field i can only stand there in a daze with the continued outcome of unexpected events part 3 im the only one out in the athletic fields which were flooded with both the enemies and my comrade break the world of demonic swords that is covering the sports ground but by losing its master the demonic swords make a sound and start to shatter one by one the fragments of demonic sw ords that float in the air of the sports ground while making a silver glow its making a magical atmosphere due to the sparkling lights all of the demonic swords disappears from the sports ground within few seconds without a second to spare i catch a glimpse of a shadow up in the air when i look up there is a magician with a hood its risers queen she is supposed to be fighting
akeno san but only akeno san retired it doesnt seem like the enemy received any wounds what is going on its n ot possible for akeno san to lose without achieving anything the knight eliminated risers queen makes derisive laughter while saying that cold word that moment i snap were you the one who did in kiba and akeno san that explosion yeah kon ekochan also retired because of that explosion created from the demonic power damn it she even took kiba come down here akeno san koneko chan and kiba i will avenge them come down i will take you down with my sacred gear so come doooooown i put my fist upwards and provoke the queen the queen looks at me with a grin and flies off towards the new school building rooftop with her black wings as if she lost interest in me wait i said wait damn it i chase after the queen with my anger i wont let you go like hell i will buchou is there asia is also there i wont let you hurt any of my comrades anymore i wont let yoooooou slip agah there is no strength in my legs and
i fall i try to get up quickly but there isnt any power left in my body my body wont move because its shaking like mad even i know it my stamina has hit its limit i lasted this long because buchou trained me but this will be the outcome if someone like me with no battle experience fights this long my heart beat is pulsing really fast as well im also breathing hard the damage is getting worse and it looks bad im about to lose my mind because my face arms legs and stomach hurts i also cant think straight because i lost my comrades right in front of me this is probably because i just witnessed the situation that made me feel as if my heart got ripped out from my body but i have to stand what moves me even under this situation is my duty where i have to go to where buchou is ngaaaaaaaaa aaah i shout out really loudly so i can put my spirit up it seems like there is a bit of energy left in my legs then i can stand i stand up slowly and i manage to face the
direction of the school building yeah i need to go to the rooftop when i was thinking of going someone speaks to me are you still going to continue to fight when i turn around risers sister comes down from the sky with her wings of fire she wasnt eliminated with the demonic swords did she evade it by flying if i think about it the announcement said only one bishop retired i make a stance against her but she shrugs her shoulders im not going to fight any more because no matter how you think about it its your groups loss shut up neither me or buchou have f allen yet the power of the dragon from earlier it certainly was something tremendous to transfer the power you boosted to the person you choose i think its an abnormal power and thinking of rias samas power of destruction and priestess of lightnin g powers rising scares me that power would be a threat to the highclass devils in the rating game in the future but its your groups loss for this battle is it because phoenix is immortal thats part of it but also because both you and rias
sama barely have any stamina left correct even if you can heal any wounds you cant heal stamina in this situation you will lose because you will get even more worn out also risers sister takes out a small bottle what is that is it holy water i t cant be phoenixs tear have you heard of it this is it our tears can heal all types of injuries phoenixs tears buchou told me about it at the camp in the mountain but is it even allowed dont say its cheating your group also has a perso n who possesses the twilight healing correct she says it as if she read my mind and it even is in the rule book that only two devils participating in the rating game can use it it was restricted because it was too powerful well that would be na tural in our case our queen and myself was in possession of it thats why our queen was able to defeat the priestess of lightning also our tears are sold for high prices thanks to that the house of phoenix is very wealthy only good things happe ned since the game was created immortality
and tears this certainly is our age risers sister starts to speak proudly phoenixs tear n no if the opponent can heal during battle then even akeno san will it wont go anywhere if i just think about the negatives i make up my mind again and walk towards the building hhold on are you ignoring me you are going to lose anyway so its safer to stay here with me shut up just talk to yourself bird girl if you get close to me i will strip you na ked risers sister makes a stance to defend herself yeah since she is a girl thats the right response i move towards the building after a while i heard a shrill voice from behind part 4 i got into the building from the back door and am running t hrough the corridor my goal is the rooftop to buchous side heartbeat there is a change of trait inside me i have met the criteria since i got into the enemy base promotion queen i can feel power within my body i run thorough the corridor b ut sliiiiiip i fell violently in the corridor i have lost the sense of
feeling in my legs i know the reason for it my stamina hit the limit right even if i gained a new ability i dont have the stamina to use it even so i still have to stand i have to go to the rooftop even if i have to crawl akeno sans gone koneko chans gone kibas gone all of my comrades disappeared from this field im the only member left that can protect buchou i have to persistently go to the rooftop i dont want t o lose i cant lose buchou i will make you win buchou i stand and fall i stand and fall again i continue to move up as i keep on repeating that im heading towards buchou while i shed tears drool and blood i then come to see the door to the ro oftop i open the door vigorously without taking a breath buchou and riser are confronting each other asia is looking at them nervously from a distance good they are both safe but buchou is inhaling her breath painfully her beautiful crimson hair is messed up and her uniform is torn i then inhale a large amount of air and
buchoooooooou hyoudou issei here at your seeeeeervice i say it out loudly so everyone on the rooftop can hear me everyones gazes are directed at me ise isesan buchou and asia makes a shout of joy hehehe now im here i cant let the girls wait the dragon brat huh that ravel she let him pass huh riser makes a sound with his tongue it seems like his sister is going through a rebellious age thanks to that i got here safely then risers queen comes down next to him riser sama should i take care of the pawn boy and the bishop girl also the power of the pawn boy could be troublesome his ability to get rid of what his opponents wear riser stops his queen who stepped forward with his hand it would be troublesome if he gets rid of the flame that covers my body i wonder about that from that ability and from riass pawns personality it probably only has an effect on women i will be their opponent then they will also be convinced what the hell is that its the last part so i will let them do what they want is that
what hes trying to say he also understands the ability of my dress break completely yeah it only has an effec t on girls i made it by imaging it like that i dont want to see a guys naked body nor do i want to touch it well it does have the power to peel off fruits and vegetables skins but it doesnt show any effect besides girls dont mess around riser the angered buchou shoots her demonic power ball at risers face he doesnt even dodge it and receives it on his face ah his face is blown away yes while i was making a sign of joy fire appears from the part of his blown face and starts to form a sha pe risers face returns to its original shape since the flame turns into his face and hair riser starts to twitch his neck as if nothing happened immortal this is the regeneration ability of the fire bird phoenix rias resign you will make your o tousama and sirzechs sama who are watching from another place look bad you have no more choices everyone already has foreseen the outcome its checkmate rias riser says it as
if he can see the outcome but buchou just glares at him shut your mout h riser i wont give up they knew the outcome i have no more choices me the king is still active you know buchou laughs fearlessly yeah if buchou says that then i can continue to fight its not over yet we are going to turn the table now i went to buchous side and stand between riser and her asia when i called asia she looks at riser and his queen nervously and then she comes to me both riser and his queen dont even try to shoot asia who is moving towards me i kind of imagined they wouldnt but for them to have this much confidence asia starts to heal mine and buchous wounds when asias hand touches me and buchou our body starts to get surrounded by a shade of green light the pain disappears from my body as if the earlie r pain was just my imagination my swollen face starts to heal and my numb legs returns back to normal slowly but my stamina doesnt return even if the wounds healed the stamina hasnthuh asia stay back after you
heal us asia puts on a shock ed face her expression tells me that she didnt imagine for me to say that to her if asia stays then you can heal me and buchou you are like our lifeline asia has a sad face and it seems like she wants to say something but she closes her lips and s teps back this is right if asia is safe kyah what i hear asias scream what comes into my eyes is the unfamiliar magic circle below asias foot it seems like it is restricting asia from moving sorry about that it would make you guys seem path etic if it takes too long i could have taken that girl down but i just made sure you guys cant heal any more that magic circle can only be unsealed if my queen is defeated riser says that plainly the opponents queen is putting her hand forward and her fingers are glowing i see so that queen is restricting asia shit asia is one of our last trump cards but i dont have the time to complain the last battle buchou the battle continues right yes it does buchou sounds as if
she hasn t given up yet yeah we can still do it but only me buchou and asia are left and asia is captured he on the other hand is immortal he also has two servants as well the situation is the worst i make a grin and say it out loudly but i wont give up im dumb so i dont know anything about foreseen or checkmate but i can still fight i can continue fighting as long as i can crunch my fist well said ise lets defeat riser together yes buchou buchou orders me proudly like usual you he ard right boosted gear my master gave me an order its simple i just need to beat the guy in front of me yeah just that lets go burst that is the sound that i shouldnt have listened to when the jewel makes that sound my body feels heavy in stantly and it feels like my body stopped working my consciousness is fading no anything but that i fall to the ground and vomit what is coming out of my mouth its a vomit of blood i realise it when i see that i realise that my insides
are at the ir limit as well the light disappears from the jewel thats because me the possessor has reached the limit and so it has stopped functioning i dont have any injuries i can still fight riser says it to me who am on the ground the boosted gear s ability exhausts the possessor more than you can imagine doubling your power is something very abnormal the burden it puts on the body is several times higher than the ordinary sacred gear you have been running around the battlefield fighting my serv ants and continued using the boosted gear riass pawn you already reached your limit a long time ago not yet even if you say that even if that is true i can still buchou who is next to me makes a sad face im sorry for making you worry its not a problem i will stand up now i will i put strength in my legs and got up how many times have i fell down and got up now buchou lets go i went running towards riser part 5 guhaa intense pain strikes me i lost count of how many times i r eceived this intense
pain today i went down on the ground countless of times i look so uncool buchou lets win i will definitely win buchou is already on her knees and isnt trying to stand up buchou ran out of her demonic power she blew riser away countless times but riser kept on resurrecting and spreading his fire as if nothing happened i need to protect buchou and asia im the only one who can protect those two now i bang risers fist went deep into my stomach and he twists his f ist to make it go deeper gough bloods comes out of my mouth so i can cough out blood even though i already spat out so much blood before my eyes become blurry i shake my head so i can make my eyes clear its alright i will win i will defeat this riserand will present you with victory buchou then you will smile right if you and asia will laugh then i yeah buchou thank you for training me i can still stand because of you i will win im a pawn i will become the strongest pawn yeah the strongest bang the fist went in to my
face it feels like its moving at slow motion the moment it hits me i can still fight buchou i will k eep the promise i will win checkmate the battle progress to its climax i understand it i rias gremory have no more moves in other words checkmate now there is not a single person on my side who any strength left but that boy continues to stand up ise he is the only one who continues to move forward towards riser even under this situation however its over the punch from riser earlier has finished ise seeing that boy fall backwards my body rushes towards him uncons ciously ises body that i am holding onto is bloody and is covered with sweat so hes in terrible condition even so i still loved this boy ise you did very well its all right now good job i whispered to him gently but he tries to get up by getting away from me its all right now ise he pushes my hands away and tries to get up he takes a step and another step without saying anything its a bizarre view which has so much intensity in it everyone
is watching him while holding their breath the opponent riser also approaches him expressionlessly no if i let this continue i will lose ise my adorable servant my ise im still planning to adore him even more so i dont want to lose him in a place like this i went between ise an d riser and stood in front of ise ise stop cant you listen to my i said it till there and swallowed my words of course this he is iseyou are ise has already lost consciousness both his eyes are hollow and he has his mou th still open even so he continues to move forward while crunching his fists that are shaking you are still planning to fight even though you are in this state i have tears on my cheeks without realising it i reach my hand towards t his adorable boys cheek his cheeks are swollen and i cant sense anything from his cheeks that usually gives strength to me you dummy i hug ise who tries to move forward good job ise when i said those words strength disappears from his b ody and he fell to the ground i hugged his
body and laid him on my lap you did say that you wanted a lap pillow buchou i will definitely make you win ise hasnt barely learned how to use his demonic powers yet he continues to move forward wit h all his might within the battlefield he barely has any battle experience he should have been scared there should have been times where he almost lost his life i wont give up im dumb so i dont know anything about foreseen or checkmate however i can still fight i will continue to fight till the end as long as i can crunch my fists he continued to fight for me even though his fists got this swollen he always did he was always smiling he was always doing his best and he continu es to fight for me i was almost about to lose ise forever thank you akeno yuuto koneko asia andise thank you for fighting for someone worthless like myself after i pat ises head gently i say it to riser its my loss i resign my first rating game it starts from a bitter and a painful defeat i will never forget this defeat end game
red im having a red dream something makes a sudden complaint to me within myself its saying that the power i am using now isnt its rea l strength who said that the sacred gear something which is inside me he moves its lips while shaking its scorching fire if you are like that you will never get strong i hear something like that in my mind its not something i thought inside my h ead it came from deep within my heart no it came from my left arm you are an abnormal being who possesses a dragon within you dont show such a miserable state the white guy will laugh at you are you that dragon that appeared in that d ream was that new power up because of you yeah thats what you desired what i desired and what the white guy desired thats why you went into a new phase desire what are you saying i mean who the heck is the white guy he will appear before you sooner or later yeah he and i are destined to fight oh yeah by the way its about my power i will teach you how to use
its real power what are you saying what on earth are you welsh dragon ddraig hyoudou issei im the one inside of your left arm welsh dragonddraig losing may be all right if you dont die losing can become your strength however it only means something if you win the next fight lose then win then continue to win if you do that you w ill meet him so whats going to happen between me and him you will know soon enough get stronger for that coming day i will give you my power any time you want however keep it in your mind that it will come with a sacrifice of something gre at i will give you something that is worth the sacrifice you can show it to those who laughed at you the existence of a dragon that is life vs power i came to keep my promise part 1 when i wake up there is a familiar ceiling above me its my room why am i here i try to remember desperately of what happened i was supposed to be having a match the rating game between buchou and riser the stage was the replica of
the school i go to our base was the old school building and i was running through the battlefield along with kiba and koneko chan aiming towards the enemys base which was the new school building koneko chan fell kiba fell akeno san fell and then then i got my mind straight what happened to buchou the matc h the outcome did we defeat riser why am i here when i got my upper body up it looks like you are awake the woman next to me speaks to me the silver haired maid grayfia san grayfia san the match what happened to buchou riser sama won t he match rias ojousama resigned iit cant be i got speechless i dont know what to say did i lose was i beaten by riser shameful im such a shameful and useless guy i acted so big and i couldnt do anything and went down right in front o f buchou im weak why am i so weak even asia could have continued to live as a human if i was a bit stronger back then even for buchou if i could have used my sacred gear even more effectively it wouldnt
have ended like this i cant stop mysel f from crying even if grayfia san is next to me i didnt stop myself from crying im so frustrated i feel so shameful at myself im so weak and im so pathetic currently the engagement party for ojou sama and riser sama is taking place its at t he assembly hall in the underworld that was prepared by the house of gremory where are kiba and the others they went to escort ojou sama the only ones who arent at the hall who are related to them are issei sama and asia sama asia so asia didn t go due to rias samas wish asia sama stayed here with me taking care of you issei sama she went downstairs to get a new towel for you i see so buchou left asia by my side for me looks like i made her worry about me buchou engagement its probably the middle of the party right now cant you come to agree with this thats how grayfia san asked me yes even if the battle is over i cant come to accept it you do know that rias ojousama obeyed the familys
decision i understand that i know that even so i i cant agree with something buchou is against i dont want to see buchou who has to obey her parents against her will that bastard i dont want to hand buchou to a bastard like that i understand it this is jealousy im feeling really jealous towards that bastard as a same guy i dont want to hand over buchou to someone like him fufufu suddenly grayfia san laughs quietly its my first time seeing her smile she always seems cold and calm you are a very inte resting person for a long time i have seen many devils however it is my first time seeing someone like you who shows what you are thinking with your face and acts accordingly to what you believes in my master sirzechs sama was watching your effort in the battle from another place and said that you were interesting you know seriously maou sama thinks about me like that if buchous brother who is also the king of devils calls me interesting i dont know how to respond t o that grayfia san takes out a single paper there is a magic circle
written on it this magic circle allows you teleport to the hall of the engagement party of the house of gremory and house of phoenix wwhy does she have something me this i have a message from sirzechs sama for you she pauses for a second and then speaks with a serious face if you want to save my sister barge into the hall thats what he said there is also another magic circle on the back of the paper please use it w hen you take back ojou sama i am definitely sure that it will be useful to you i dont know how to respond grayfia san leaves the paper with magic circle in my hand and she then stands up and tries to leave my room when you were sleeping i fe lt a very enormous power within you issei sama the dragon is the only being that didnt form an alliance with either god the devils or the fallen angels if its that dreadful power then grayfia san stops there and left my room im left alone in my room theres no need to think about it i got up from my bed and i went
to find something to wear i then found the new uniform on my table so the old one got torn and damaged that badly in that battle did someone prepare this for me was it grayfi asan or buchou whoever it is i thank you it happens when i put my uniform on and grabbed the paper the door opens and asia comes in isesan as soon as asia sees me asia drops the towel and bucket of water on the floor she then jumps into m y arms wow asia whats wrong i will feel embarrassed if you suddenly hug me like this thank god im so glad you slept for two days even when your wounds healed i thought you were never going to open your eyes again ise san asia starts to c ry in my arms oh man i made her cry again i try to calm her down while patting her head more importantly i was sleeping for two days so two days had passed since we lost the match huh asia listen to me im going to buchous side now she s eems very shocked at what i had just said she seems to
know what im about to do its notto celebrate ityes yeah im going to take back buchou its not a problem i got my hands on a ticket to go to the hall im going too asia said it wi thout a second thought she has a serious face oh man you cant you stay here asia i dont want to i can fight along with you ise san i learned how to use my demonic powers i dont want to just be protected any more asia grabs my hand it fee ls like she is saying that she doesnt want to be away from me no thats what she must mean no you will stay asia i will bring buchou back you know something like this is boosted gears expertise its all right i will beat up riser easily and it isnt all right asia raises her voice her voice is mixed with her cries there are tears that are coming out from her green irises and she has a very sad face you will get bloody battered and mushy again are you going to go through all that pain again i dont want to see ise san in
that state ever again i received critical injuries when i took asia back from the fallen angel and the group of stray exorcists i also got battered in the battle against riser i probably would have died if i didnt get healed by asia i can even imagine asia crying while healing me i will probably continue to make this girl go through sadness even from now on i imagined a bit about the future like that while putting on a big smile i grabbed asias hand i wont die absolutely i promise remember how i was alive when i saved you thats why i will be okay i will not die i will live and will stay with you even from now on asia nods while wiping her tears then please promise me one more thing promise please definitely come back with buchou san asia says that to me with a smile yeah of course when i answered her like that asia smiles really happily oh i remember now theres something i want to ask asia asia the truth is when i told asia the circumstances im in she agrees to it and went to her room to bring
a certain thing now the only thing left is i close my eyes and talk within my heart oi come out if you can hear me you are there arent you welsh dragon ddraig if you are there i need to talk to you come out shortly after i called out to him a creepy laugh echoes within me yeah what is it brat what business do you have with me part 2 shinnnnnnnnne i teleported to an unfamiliar place with the magic circle grayfia san gave me i thought that i couldnt transport because i lack demonic power however it seems like it worked possibly because this magic circle may be special i look around the place i appeared in its a very spacious corridor on the wal l there are rows of candles that is lined up till the end of the building oh there is also a huge portrait of a man with crimson hair on the wall is it buchous relative oh i dont have the time to be wasting here i walk towards the direction where i can hear noises then there is a gigantic door that is opened there are huge engravings on the
door is it a model of some kind of mystical beast well that isnt important right now when i looked inside from the door there are lots of devils who ar e dressed up and are having a good time these kinds of things are similar to the high society parties of humans well i had never been in one though somehow i imagined it to be like this i look at the devils slowly to try and find familiar faces howe ver it certainly is a spacious hall isnt it bigger than the school field the ceiling is really high up the enormously gigantic chandelier is also amazing so this is the hall people from buchous household organised oh my rich people sure are amazin g i want to get my peerage quickly and become someone important when i was thinking something like that a crimson colour appears to my eye a woman who has her crimson hair tied up she is wearing a red dress i knew it with a single glance of course thats because she is the person i admire buchooooooooou by the time i realise it i had called out to buchou so loud that
it echoes throughout the hall it gathers the attention of the devils around me and buchou also looks towards my way that moment i didnt miss the glimpse of buchou who opens her eyes wide and shed a single drop of tear i also realise that she moves her lips saying ise the bastard riser who is next to buchou also notices me that jerk is trying to show off by wearing a fancy tuxedo i then declare it after taking a big breath to all the high class devils here and buchous brother maou sama my name is hyoudou issei from kuoh academy i have arrived to take back buchou rias gremory sama the hall becomes even noisi er without any care about them i walk towards buchou and riser hey you do you know where this a person who seems to be a guard comes to stop me however there are those who comes in to stop the guards as well isekun leave this to us its ki ba its kiba who is wearing a white tuxedo you are late a small build girl who is wearing a dress comes in to stop the guards as well ara
ara so you finally showed up akeno san who is wearing an expensive looking kimono is also present all of them are stopping those who are trying to get in my way thank you i thanked them quietly and went towards riser confidently when i faced him upfront i say it straight at him buchou rias gremory samas virginity belongs to me riser makes a face that you cant explain with words whats the meaning of this riser hey lady rias whats the meaning of this relatives and authorised people are making unsettled faces and they are panicking so the devils just like humans gets confused when they face unexpected things huh its an event that i organised that moment a man with crimson hair who was sitting at the far back walks towards us its the person who was drawn in the portrait at the corridor he seems to resemble buchou oniisama buchou called this man that wait onii samaaaaaaaa tthen this person is the mmmmmaou sirzechs lucifer sama i wanted to see the power of the dragon so i asked grayfia ssirzechs sama you cant do something irresponsible like this i dont know whos relative he is but
a middle aged man is panicking it should be fine the rating game from last time was very entertaining but it was a bit disadvantage for my little sister who had no game experience to face off against riser kun who is a prodigy from the house of phoenix so sirzechs sama you are saying that the last game wasnt fair no no not at all if a maou such as myself says such things then i would be making the old nobles look bad the connection between the h ighclass devils is important after all maou sama says it with a smile from the way he spoke is he aiding buchou then sirzechs what do you want to do about it a middle aged man with crimson hair asks maou sama crimson hairis that buchous fath er father i want to make my cute little sisters engagement party into a flashy one dragon versus phoenix dont you think its the ultimate event to stir up the party by having a battle between legendary creatures there arent any entertainment whi ch can surpass this everyone in the hall becomes silent with maou samas words sirzechs sama then looks at me
dragon user kun you have our permission riser can you show your power once more right in front of rias and i hearing maou samas wish r iser makes a fearless smile very well there is no way i can decline if sirzechs sama asks me this riser will show his last performance before getting married looks like he is eager to do this with this the stage for the battle between us is set only thing left is for me to win im raising my spirit and maou sama asks me dragon user kun what prize do you want when you win the match sirzechs sama what are you saying the relatives starts criticising at sirzechs samas offer however hes a devil so we need to give him something fitting for it since we are asking him to do something for us now then i can give you anything a peerage or the most beautiful woman maou sama asks me while ignoring the voices of others around him that is the best offer i can ask for my dream lies in there a peerage and the most beautiful woman with one word i can have either of it however
i have already decided on what i will wish for i ask you to give me rias gremory sama back maou sama makes a very happy face when i answer him without any pause very well if you win you may take rias with you with this conversation its decided that the battle between riser and i will commence in this hall thank you very much i bow my head to maou sama who went back to the end of the hall part 3 the centre of the hall was cleared in a hurry the devils in the hall are standing around the space watching with keen eyes the club members are sitting in the same place as buchou maou sama is also next to buchou on the other hand at the house of phoenix side their relatives their servants and risers sister are sitting there and riser and i are confronting each other at the centre of the space so this must be a devils ring then i already h ave my boosted gear on my left arm riser has a confident face please start the devil male who is in charge of the battle gave a call for
the start of the match the battle starts theres no more turning back yeah i just have to win but before that happens riser who has his fire wings out points at my gauntlet all of your ability is already cracked a sacred gear that keeps on doubling the power of the user the boosted gear also it seems like you gained a new ability that can transfer the mul tiplied power into an object or your allies so he knows about the ability of boosted gear gift yeah i expected it also gift is a million times stronger if i fight with my allies i make a big grin towards buchou buchou i will finish it in 10 s econds ise buchou makes a doubtful face its all right i will show it to you now you sure talk big for saying that you will finish it in 10 seconds then i will finish you off in 5 seconds it wont be like last time rias pawn riser phoeni x im going to crush you down with everything i got buchou please allow me to use promotion here buchou nods at my request heart beat i heard the noise
within me this feeling is the approval from buchou who is allowing me to use promotion promotion queen i then promoted to the ultimate piece i can feel the power that is coming from within me the start of the battle will be the climax heres the next one lets go red dragon emperor lets go my sacred gear buchou i shout towar ds buchou i dont have talent for swords like kiba im not a genius like akeno san at using demonic power i dont have a crazy strength like koneko chan nor do i have a healing power like asia even still i will become the strongest pawn i promis e i promise you buchou for you i will even beat god with this boosted gear my only weapon i will make sure that i will protect you i will definitely protect you and become stronger along with my comrades shiiiiiine over boost welsh dragon over booster the jewel in the gauntlet releases a red light the red light shines throughout the entire hall a deep crimson colour aura covers me this power your power is flowing into me yeah use it however only for 10 seconds your
body can t endure more than that i know that red dragon san i will settle it in 10 seconds thats right with 10 seconds you will yeah if i have 10 seconds i can we can take him down i leap forward while emitting a red aura my body is equipped with a red armour a plate armour that has the motif of a dragon the whole armour has a sharp shape the gauntlet i always have on my left arm also is equipped to my right arm the jewel that was present on the gauntlet also appears on both my arms shoulders knees and the middle of the torso on the back there is something like a rocket booster propulsion an armour you made the power of the red dragon emperor shape into a physical form riser is shocked his comment is acute well i do look like a smal l red dragon even my face is covered by the armour this is the power of the emperor of dragons the balance breaker boosted gear scale mail if you want to stop me go and ask maou sama after all it seems like this is the the hated
forbidden tech nique the scale mails ability is to releases a destructive power for 10 seconds once released i will be invincible for 10 seconds however there is a big risk 10 seconds after unleashing this ability i wont be able to use my sacred gear for three days thats how the red dragon ddraig explained to me so its a sink or swim invincible mode x the count starts since this is activated theres no time to spare i will end this right away riser phoenix i lift a little gap between my hands while bringing them close and then created a mass of demonic power between my hands i shoot it towards riser right away the demonic power created from the palm of my hand got enormous and went towards riser what an enormous amount of demonic power its so huge that it takes up about half the size of this hall even i who shot it is shocked its enormous since it was so big that it betrayed risers prediction he chooses to evade it instead of taking it this is the chance ix the countdown has alre ady started i know dont rush me i jump
towards the place where riser will possibly run to the propeller located on the back of the armour releases a demonic power that instant it releases an explosive speed because of the g force i cant move my b ody however it reduces the distance between me and riser since im coming towards the place he ran to in an insane speed riser puts on a shocked face and he makes a stance while not having any counter measure for it i will attack here well thats wha t i like to say but without doing anything i craaaaash i crashed into the wall such a disappointment that was a chance when i crashed i guarded with both my arms so i dont have any damages however there is a huge hole in the wall wow amazing b oth my body and the armour arent damaged despite crashing into the wall in that insane speed with this hard armour doesnt it guarantee that my opponent will receive a critical damage if i simply crash into them with an insane speed viii 8 seconds l eft i got up and shook off the fragments of the wall and confronted riser again
riser becomes more vigilant than before after seeing my attacks his body starts to get covered in a rainbow colour aura i can feel his enormous demonic power with my skin shitty red dragon emperor brat sorry but i wont hold back i dont want to admit it but right now you are a monster in front of your master rias peeeeeerish a giant pair of wings of fire appears on risers back who was howling theres a whirlwind of fire surrounding him and the hall is surrounded by an intense fire its so strong that even the devils who are within this hall starts to create a barrier to protect themselves it must mean that there wont be a bone left if you get hit by that fire bird and fenghuang the hell fire of our clan that was praised as being that of a phoenix taste it with your own body and turn into ashes riser who is covered in flames rushes towards me really fast there is an insane amount of flames right in front of me the silhouette resembles a gigantic fire bird the intense mass of fire that are created from his wings will it
be bad if i touch it the fire of the immortal bird phoenix can also leave a scratch on the scale of dragons it isnt a good idea to c ontinue being hit by it is that so ddraig but i cant do that that person is looking i will stop that attack while buchou is looking at me theres no way that i will perish from a crappy fire like yours i run towards him while shouting the prope ller on my back releases fires made up of demonic power hit when both of our fists hit each others face it shakes the whole hall because of the impact created from our powers clashing at the centre of the hall riser and i started exchanging punches guu i get struck by a heavy impact every time i get hit by his attack then a hot flame attacks me its hot shit its so freaking hot the temperature of the flame i feel from risers fist if i didnt have this armour on then it may not have left a bone for real im scared i want to leave here i dont want to die the more fists i exchange
with riser the more i realised the difference between our actual powers when i remove this armour the power difference between riser and i will be that of an ant and an elephant after all im just a mere lower class devil and hes a high class devil maybe he realised im feeling scared so riser smirks are you scared are you afraid of me of course you are merely a trash if you didnt have a boosted gear if you didnt have that armour then you would have perished before my fist reached you thats right if you take that gauntlet off then you have no value hes saying whatever he feels like but hes right if you take this gauntlet away from me then i will be nothing vii the serious battle between devils fear struck my whole body i dont want to experience something scary like this but i pull out a certain thing that i was hiding in a section of my gauntlet bang my fist hit right into r isers face with a cross counter riser bends back that wont work on cough there are a lot of blood coming out from risers mouth my
hit was critical against riser of course after all i am holding onto this with my hand i open my hand and show what im holding onto to riser a cross you have a cross riser is shocked i can even hear screams from the devils inside this hall thats right an item that devils are weak against the cross i punched riser while holding onto it its the thing i borrowed from asia i got it from her on my way here which i hid it away vi i punched you while increasing the effect of the cross with my sacred gear a holy attack that has increased drastically can even be used against high class devils even if y ou are the immortal bird phoenix you wont be able to heal this attack that easily right absurd crosses bring intense suffering to devils even if you wear a dragons armour touching it is absolutely foolish that instant riser notices the change on my left arm for the first time you wont notice my left arm is only a section of the dragons armour that is covering my whole body but you will be able notice it if you
take a good look at it the difference between the whole armour that looks like it is made up of inorganic material and my left arm that is continuously giving out a pulse did you give yourleft arm to the dragon residing in the gauntlet so thats the reason for your insane powers yeah thats right i gave my left arm i n order to use this power for a temporary period my left arm is the arm of an actual dragon thats why a cross doesnt work on me changing my left arm was the sacrifice needed to use ddraigs absolute powers i gave my left arm so i could fight on par with riser the gauntlet became a part of my left arm if you do that then your left arm wont return to normal do you know that what about it v the countdown is decreasing while we are talking about useless things buchou will come back just w ith one arm of someone like me you know its a pretty cheap deal dont you think risers eyes changes after hearing what i just said you are crazy so thats why you can hit punches without any
hesitation you are scary i have become scared of yo u for real for the first time and for that both of risers wings turns into a bigger flame im going to beat you with everything i have fire bird he rushes towards me while the surroundings are engulfed by fire i wont lose i will not lose iv uoooooooooooooooo i put all my power to the cross im holding on to one hit i will put everything i have into this cross risers fist and my fist they crash against each other flash the clash between two incredible powers a flash created from the collision blinds my eyes i can also feel the sensation of the things im wearing disappears the same feeling you have when you take your rain coat off when you get home on a rainy day its similar to that at the same time i can feel the heat that i s surrounding my body its hot like crazy until before i didnt feel anything hot like this when i got my sight back i realised the change in me the armour is gone the armour of a red dragon that was covering my whole
body disappeared unprotected bo dy the only thing left is my left arm of a dragon my cross that seemed to have been knocked off during the previous attack is lying on the floor a bit away from me hey dragon emperor whats the meaning of this it hasnt been 10 seconds yet why has t he armour disappeared wait are you telling me the price i paid only let me use it this much no the price you paid to attain my power was enough but your basic stats are too low to control my powers you lack training damn it i trained that muc h with everyone and yet im lacking it that was nothing compared to the long life a devil a training of devils means something if you train for dozens of years ah dammit i dont need things like that now give me the armour one more time what do i have to pay this time my eyes my legs i will give you anything using the second armour in this short time is impossible for you now is that because i am weak shit why do i look so uncool at crucial times that
was the only thing someone useless like me could do the moment the power of the armour disappeared i transferred a bit of the power to the jewel you can overwhelm riser phoenix for a short time but thats it to beat those from phoenix clan i have to beat him down hundreds of times or eliminate him with absolute power yeah sadly you wont be able to beat him many times with the current power of the gauntlet even the multiplied power is far from close to the absolute power you dont have either of the two grip i was grabbed strongly by my collar its riser i got lifted up from the ground while having my neck choked riser chokes me strongly while smirking its painful i praise you for doing this well for a pawn you really did well to be honest i didnt e xpect you to do this well the power of the dragon user i was able to taste that with my own body if you had a year no six months for you to get used to your dragons power i would have lost he doesnt seem to be joking he has a
serious face if its only six monthsthen wait for the marriage for another six months thats what i want to say risers clothes and body are worn like i thought even for riser who had a very high regeneration ability the rate to heal the damage from holy attacks is t aking long his wings of fire are smaller than before so he received quite a lot of damage from me theres nothing you should feel ashamed about i will train you after i become rias groom you will become a strong devil shut up thats none of your business now its about time i put you to sleep you will lose consciousness for a short while by the time you wake up the ceremony would have finished safely you dont want to suffer any more than this right im not a sadist so i will end this r ight away riser puts on a face that he has confirmed his victory im going to lose no that will be unforgivable please definitely come back with buchou san yeah i know asia first of all aim to become the strongest pawn yes i know buchou lets go home together akeno
san kiba koneko chan asia and i are all waiting for your return thats why i take out a small object from my pocket to extinguish fire you need water right the thing im holding on to is a small bottle that cont ains holy water this was the other thing i prepared before i came here an item that doesnt have that much effect against high class devils if the devils here in the hall sees this then they will have just laughed with their nose however risers face turns pale thats right what do i possess in my left arm what ability does my left arm have answer me riser phoenix damn it risers hand that is choking me becomes even stronger ku my throat is about to get crushedbut before that i open the lid and sprinkled the holy water on riser i then multiplied the effect of the holy water to the level that the high class devils cant ignore boosted gear gift transfer the multiplied power flows from my gauntlet to the holy water on risers body cra it was too late by the time riser realised my attack the transferred power multiplied the effects
of the holy water on risers body boil the sound of the water vaporising from fire echoes throughout the whole hall risers wings of fire starts to look weird because he cant maintain its form the holy water burns risers body insanely there is smoke coming out of his whole body i got out from his grip and take my distance while holding onto my throat man he choked me really hard ugaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaah riser starts to writhe with the effect of the holy water is he going to die no even if the effect of the holy water has increased it wont be simple to kill someone from the phoenix clan is that right ddraig however the effect o f the holy water extinguishes a lot of their stamina and their force of will even if its a phoenix who can come back to life from ashes losing a great amount of stamina and force of will is he wont be able to recover his emotional strength right away smoke the smoke that is coming out from risers body weakens whats left is riser who has a worn out body and clothes i pick up the cross from the
ground with my dragon arm i hold it tight and put my power in it i also sprinkled the second holy wat er i was hiding on my hand asia told me this that devils are weak against the cross and the holy water so increasing the ability of both of them at the same time would give enormous damage to devils right ku riser who is suffering from the effec t of the holy water makes a scared face after seeing my next move i look around riser and his surroundings there is nothing except riser yeah theres no problem kiba told me this to widen my line of sight and look towards the enemy and its surroundi ngs i gather all of the demonic power in my body at one point i then changed it to a dragons power and transfer it to the holy water and cross transfer with this the holy attack gained incredible powers akeno san told me this to gather the de monic power that flows throughout your whole body to concentrate and feel the wave of the demonic power yeah even an idiot like me can feel it akeno san i then changed
my stance so i can hit my opponent koneko chan told me this when you hit someon e aim at the middle of the body and nail it deep into their body accurately they were all the things i learned from the training yeah everyone i remembered them all they all became useful im going to take back buchou with the power of everyone when i aimed my fist at riser he starts to panic hhold on do you even know what you are doing this engagement is important and necessary for the future of devils its not something a devil brat like you can butt into i dont know anything complicat ed but theres something i remember vaguely when i lost against you and became unconscious buchou was crying she was crying and she was also crying before that reason is enough for me to beat the shit out of you bang my fist that has the cross a nd the effects of the holy water nails deeply and accurately into his stomach gahaa riser takes a few steps backwards while coughing blood for me to lose like this he said that and falls on the ground he doesnt
stand up after that part 4 i glan ce at riser who doesnt seem to show any movements and then i walk towards buchou then someone gets in my way its risers sister she glares at me silently and seems like she wants to complain to me i point my dragon arm towards her and then say if yo u have a complaint then come to me i will take you on any time risers sister backs down because of my intensity and makes a path for me i went past risers sister and stand in front of buchou i say it to her while smiling buchou lets go home ise i then look at the person next to buchou its a dandy man with crimson hair its buchous father i walk in front of him and bow my head down then i say it clearly i will take back buchou rias gremory sama im very sorry for my actions but i will be taking buchou with me buchous father doesnt say anything and closes his eyes maou sama who is supposed to be sitting next to him isnt there and is gone i want to thank him i will
the next time i see him i take buchous hand i then ta ke out the magic circle that grayfia san gave me i think she told me to use the magic circle on the other side of the teleporting one after i retrieve buchou when i turn the paper around theres a glow shiiiiine what appears from the magic circle is a four legged beast with wings that i cant even tell whether its a lion or an eagle griffon i heard someone in the hall saying that oh so this guy is called griffon so is grayfia san telling me to escape from here by riding this roar griffon mak es a roar and then starts to move towards the hole i made earlier i say it to kiba and the others before i left ill be waiting at the club room with my words everyone waves their hands at me with a smile and the griffon flies up to the sky of the underworld while carrying me and buchou father x father lord phoenix im very sorry that this engagement turned out like this i know its rude but this engagement you dont have to say any
more lord gremory it was a good engagement for pure devils but it looks like we both had too much greed both of us already have pure devil grandchildren maybe its the greed as devils that made us crave for it or is it because we saw hell in the last war no i also forced my greed onto my daughter his name was hyoudou kun correct i wanted to thank him what my son lacked was defeat he overestimated the ability of our clan this will also be a good lesson for my son phoenix is not absolute just learning that was enough for this engagement lord gremory lord phoenix your daughter has a good servant looks like the underworld wont be bored in the future but i never would have thought that my daughter would pick it up welsh dragon i couldnt believe that that loathsome e xistence actually came to our side until i saw it then the next will be yes it must be no perhaps it already exists vanishing dragon its a matter of time until the red meets the white last kiss unlike the sky of the human s world the colour of the
underworlds sky is purple it looks creepy but it mysteriously gives me a sense of security is it because im a devil touch buchous hand touches my cheek while i was looking at the sky you dummy she says it with a bitte r smile buchou seems to have a relieved expression it seems like she was finally released from something painful buchou becomes speechless when she sees my left arm she is touching my left arm with a sorrowful face that may be the appropriate re action my left is covered with red scales and it became so abnormal that it has sharp claws coming out of it your arm so you gave your arm to the dragon as a price to borrow that power right yes it was a good deal someone like me with no talent and who has nothing was able to get the ultimate power just with my left arm thanks to that i was able to defeat riser and get buchou back i put on a smiling face but buchou narrows her eyes and looks even more sad you know that this left arm wont t urn back to normal any more dont you
ah thats a bit of a problem a cosplay item oh that wont work at school oh my what should i do asia will definitely cry if she finds this out ugh she will definitely cry i have been continuing t o make that girl cry you may have broken this engagement but a new engagement might be brought in you know if you keep on doing this i give my answer with a smile to buchou who is putting on a sad expression then i will give my rig ht arm as a price next time then my eyes if another one comes in i will keep on saving buchou thats the only thing i can do but i will definitely come and save you thats because i am rias gremorys pawn right after i said that my lips got b locked the thing that is blocking my lips is buchou put her hands around my neck and put her lips on top of mine its not something that happened for an instant a kiss it wasnt a deep kiss where we tangled our tongues but i can feel her feelings from this soft kiss her soft lips and
the smell of her crimson hair froze my brain after about a minute we overlapped our lips buchous lips left mine then buchou laughs kkissssss i ii just had a kiss with buchou kiss kissssss then my brain explodes wow wow wow woooooooooooow my first kiss its something that girls treasure in japan right eh y yes it certainly is huh your first kissssss im really surprised t thats because a first kiss is really important to girls aare you okay with it t that it was me you did something thats worth having a kiss with me its a reward she says it while smiling at me aaaaaah i feel as if something is going to happe n to me it was worth the effort just for this kiss speaking of first kiss do you really want my virginity that much i do ah i answered her straight away man im too honest with my greed but thats my true feeling of course i want it i e ven craved for it in front of the whole crowd geez you really are honest with these kinds of things buchou seems to have a troubled expression but she is smiling
umm im sorry for being honest with these kinds of things buchou starts to pat my cheek while i was apologising inside my head buchou just laughs happily im so glad im really glad that buchou is smiling again new life so like how i just explained i rias gremory will also be living in this house i might be inex perienced but please take care of me otou sama okaa sama at the living room of hyoudou residence a crimson hair beauty next to me is greeting my parents and there was another beauty with blonde hair next to me with teary eyes and unpleasant face she seems to be in a very bad mood after that incident buchou suddenly said she would live with me i cant understand what she meant but she mostly forced herself to make this happen she did say i want to strengthen the relationship with my servant b ut is she really okay if its my house i may not be able to understand how high class devils think and like that the engagement thing between the house of gremory and the house of phoenix was cancelled buchou is also happy so its
a happy ending that bastard riser went into a slump after experiencing his first defeat of his life oh what should i do asia chan and rias san so i will be having two daughters now my mum after living with asia started to adore asia like her own daughter so she was okay with another girl coming in my dad on the other hand is crying hard yup yup its a guys dream after all i mean to have lots of girls you may be able to fulfil the dream i had when i was young oh i see i am this persons son after all i cant believe that he also had the same dream as me and the crucial left arm of mine on the other hand its still an arm of a dragon but thanks to buchou and akeno san researching seriously about dragons it reverted back to a humans arm in everyday l ife apparently by decreasing the aura of the dragon you can stop it from dragonifying i have to do something every few days to reduce my dragons powers if i dont it will revert back to a dragons arm well i was
able to get buchou back like i tho ught it certainly was a cheap deal though the way to reduce the dragons power is a quite erotic gufufu i never thought buchou and akeno san will do those kind of thing for me in other words having this arm is a good thing ddraig became silent after that even if i talk to him he wont talk back there are so many things i want to ask him the white guy the thing ddraig was talking about apparently that thing is coming for me i dont know what that thing is but first i need to do so mething about this situation now ise we have your parents permission with this i am a member of this family so can you take my luggage to my room right away promptly yyes isesan i will help as well asia follows behind me auu look s like theres only hope for polygamy but butit will be against the teachings of godbut but at this ratehauu huh what was that about the polygamy its nothing when i ask her she looks in the other direction h mmm she seems to be in a
bad mood ever since buchou came here did asia hate buchou here ise that will go over there she starts to order me around as soon as i brought the luggage into her room yes ise i want to take a bath after this yeah i will wash your back for you are you serious ooooooh i want her to wash my back everydaaaaaay geez if you are having a bath together then so will i ise san and buchou san please dont leave me out of this asia starts to complain wi th teary eyes asia you cant you cant compete with buchou it will become even more stimulating asia im sorry but this is how it is is it all right if this is a proclamation of war uuu i dont want to lose but it seems like i will lose somehow i think there are sparks between the two just like buchou and just like asiai really cant understand how girls think is it even possible for me to have a harem at this rate however theres one thing i know it looks like my everyday life will be getting even livelier afterword how many times has
the word oppai breast appeared in volume 1 and 2 people who count them and send the answer will get rias buchous oppai mousepad yes its a lie there arent any prizes like that it has been a while its ishibumi how was volume 2 its starting to turn into a porno book and even i the author cant imagine how volume 3 will be like by the way the way to reduce the dragons power is very erotic so look forward to vo lume 3 asia is going to turn into an erotic girl because of the influence of buchou who is really erotic im aiming to make a book that middle and high school students will be too embarrassed to buy im getting worried that it might get an age restricti on but i am aiming to make a shounen style light novel so please support me sacred gears just like the evolution ability like boosted gear gift also has a super power form when you use it to the limit and master it called balance breaker this is p ossible for all the sacred gears asia and kiba are also able to do it if they master
it its similar to super saiyan and bankai ise ignored the steps by using the dragon emperors power and used it recklessly that resulted in him giving a sacrifice because hes inexperienced he couldnt release the power to its fullest its called balance breaker because its possible to break the balance of the world ise became a person who is not only talented at attacking but also at supporting now when wi ll the fateful meeting with the white guy be now for the thanks to my editor in charge who is trying to lead me into becoming a porno author h sama thanks for taking care of me all the time please eat your dinner every time i strip the characters miyama zero sama thanks for the beautiful and wonderful illustrations im sorry for troubling you with the designs i will be in your care from now on as well like that this will continue to volume 3 please have high hopes for buchous oppai in volum e 3 as well translators notes and references 1 jump up spartan instructor a really strict trainer 2 jump up oni a japanese creature from folklore its a youkai and has an

close to me when i look next to me the one who is sleeping there is the crimson haired onee sama rias buchou my master who is a high class devil she basically forced herself i nto my home several days ago and has started living with me she seems to have come in my bed before i noticed and she happens to be naked no i knew about it buchou told me herself that she sleeps naked and she even did the same thing to me when i was sleeping on the infirmary bed at school kuuuuu i can feel a soft sensation from the left side of my body shes sleeping while using me as her hugpillow buchous smell is stimulating my nose why does buchou smell this good i mean her breast i s completely touching my left arm and my left hand is completely covered by something that is extremely soft it must be her thigh my left hand is between her two thighs like a sandwich a thigh sandwich this is such a wonderful thing thanks to that i am in a situation where i cant move no i dont want to move theres no
way i can end this wonderful situation easily like that this only happened just a few days after she started living with me i thought it was going to feel awkward living with b uchou but if this kind of thing continues then i am all for it banzai oh youre awake so buchou is also awake yyes i am when i woke up it was like this so i didnt know what to do well thats how i actually feel i have no idea w hat i should do and since my master has woken up im even less sure of what im supposed to do im sorry i felt like sleeping while using you as my hugging pillow i came in after you went to sleep that kind of thing happens i really cant underst and buchous feelings buchou then hugs the left side of my body even stronger uoooooooo what should we do it might be wonderful to stay like this until its time to wake up maybe doing something a little bit naughty would be a good way to communicate with my adorable servant chuu buchou then kisses me on my cheek w why does buchou
adore me this much is it just me or has buchou started to adore me even more after the incident with riser its true that im getting a nosebleed every day umm buchouim also a guys so if you say things like that8 high school dxd volume 3 do you feel like attacking me buchou replies with a naughty voice why is buchou so good at stimulating me this much sure ill do anything that will please you having h er whisper me with her sexy voice my mind is about to go somewhere else and then knock knock someone is knocking at my door isesan its almost time for morning training the voice i hear from the other side is asias what timing i it was g etting to the good part no its not asias fault every morning i do hard training thats because im still a weak devil i still train while buchou coaches me asia supports me by acting like a manager thank you very much buchou asia isesan are you still sleeping no im awake w wait a bit i mean wait for me downstairs thats right i cant let asia see this situation its
already bad enough since asia has started to have a rivalry towards buchou ever since buchou started living here i dont know why asia looks at buchou like that but buchou has also accepted the challenge well they usually talk normally so it doesnt seem to be a serious fight anyway can the two of you please get along i dont want to see girls fighting without even knowing what was going through my mind buchou puts on a devilish smile asia wait for us a bit longer both ise and i need to get ready buchou says that to asia whos on the other side of the door buchouuuu why are you making it worse even if shes on the other side of the door i can imagine asia being speechless slam my bedroom door is opened violently asia then sees me with my upper body up and buchou asia has teary eyes she seems really displeased and is making an unple asant face buchou hugs my left arm after seeing asias face h hey buchou good morning asia buchou smiles asia whos really mad shakes her body then she puts her hand on her clothes u umm asia
san i will also get naked i dont want to be left out asia seems like today will also start with a stimulating situation part 2 itadakimasu1 breakfast time buchou and asia are sitting beside me9 high school dxd volume 3 im so blessed to be sitting between two beautiful girls well thats what i would like to say but its not that i think like that every day asia is in a bad mood from the morning even today well if asia who was a former sister saw that situation then she would think its impure wait then that i will also get naked sounds weird then why is she angry hmm for a guy like me a maidens feelings are hard to understand buchou on the other hand doesnt se em bothered and is eating while having a lively talk with my parents oh my so rias san can make delicious japanese food as well thank you otou sama i have already been living in japan for a while so i learned quite a bit of cooking yes as for t his breakfast we are eating now buchou made some of it like this fried egg which is
very delicious that i have been eating a lot of them since earlier its seriously good ise theres more so eat in a calmly manner yyes buchou i didnt find out until buchou started living with me but buchou is good at cooking japanese food western food and chinese food she has a wide range of cooking skills and can cook food of the finest quality i thought she would be bad at these kinds of things b ecause she is a princess but its the opposite she doesnt just live in japan by herself for nothing so she can do all sorts of things like cooking washing and cleaning i dont like it if a person says that i cant do these things because i am a prin cess i want to do what i am capable of doing thats what she told me before splendid indeed i truly admire you from the bottom of my heart you are amazing buchou my master is dependable even in normal day life and asia who looks at buchou as her ri val started concentrating on learning japanese culture after she saw the gap between her and buchou but asia is also
amazing she started to learn japanese letters in a short time she already mastered hiragana and katakana and was moving to learn how to read and write kanji now she probably knows how to read the kanji of grade school level now its mostly because she worked hard but also because she seems to have a talent for studying she just started school but she has no trouble with mathematics science or languages plus she said she enjoys studying which may also be the reason why she is a fast learner there are some subjects where she teaches me instead im supposed to be her guardian but i look so pathetic asia who enjoys everything started to have a rivalry towards buchou when she gets involved h hmm asia is amazing even from my point of view because she is a hard worker but if you compare her with buchou buchou is several times better in terms of cooking asias food taste good as well but her opponent is too i then drink some miso soup ah this miso soup that buchou made is delicious tears are coming out of my eyes girls who are good at cooking are so
appealing especially if that happens to be are beautiful girl who is an onee sama then i have nothing to complain about grip asia who still has a troubled face grips onto my clothes from under the table its asias habit that she only shows to me when she gets in a bad mood she does this to me without saying a word well this behaviour of her is really lovely and cute yeah i guess this is how a little sister would act10 high school dxd volume 3 oh i forgot to mention this to you ise today the club members are coming here buchou tells me huh koneko chan and the others are we doin g something in my house yes im thinking about having the occult research club meeting here huh at my house do you remember what i said before its about time to clean the whole old school building apparently they asked the cleaners to clean i t half of that is a lie the truth is that she uses her familiar to clean the building she said it like that to explain it to my parents so we will be doing the occult research
club activity at my house huh buchou bows her head down at my parents im very sorry otou sama oka sama thats all right rias san i heard that you are taking good care of ise im also happy that ise has more female friends dad nods at mums words shes right i like matsuda kun and motohama kun but i think its also important to have a friend who plays safe you cant enjoy youth by staying in your room and talking about naughty stuff thats right otou san matsuda kun and motohama kun are good boys but they have lewd eyes well they are lecherous students so it s obvious that they are a bad influence for ise and since asia san and riassan are living here now i dont want them to enter this house any more the girls will get stained they are talking about whatever they want about you guys matsuda and motohama i cant back you up because they are saying the truth but mum you know its good to have friends whom you can talk freely to they are just like that and the reason why i had fun until now is because

cheeks red ise when he was a child ise when he was a child ise when he was a child ise when he was a child is she muttering something but she seems satisfied buchou is the picture of me when i was a child your taste is buchou a shota con2 i never heard her being as such i think i know how buchou san feels asia grabs buchous hand her eyes are sparkling so you also know how i feel im so happy hey hey both of them went to another world even kiba is looking at the album with a smile shit why do i feel so bothered if a guy is looking at it ooi kiba dont look i try to take the album from kibas hand but he dodges it smoothly hahaha dont worry about it let me enjoy your album a bit more unnnngh dont enjoy iiiiiit i try to take it back again so i jump at him but he dodges it again as if it was nothing shit i witness the skill difference between us in a place like this just like how asia sees buchou as her rival i also look
at kiba as my rival just like how buchou is a big obstacle to asia kiba is also a big obstacle to me but i will definitely surpass him one day when i was making my new devotion k iba stares at a particular page rather than enjoying it he seems to have surprised eyes i got close to him and also look at the page he is staring at there is a picture of me when i was in kindergarten there is a photo of me and another boy of my age with someone who seems to be his father i remember this boy hes the boy who used to live close by when i was in kindergarten we played hero play a lot together he went to another country before moving up to first grade because of his parents work i havent seen him since then but why did kiba take an interest in this photo dont tell me this boy is kiba kiba points at the boys father on the photo to be more accurate he is pointing at the thing the boys father is carrying a sword i think its a fake sword but the boys
father is carrying an old european sword do you remember this kiba asks me seriously hey the tone of your voice is different hmm no since i was really small back then things like this happen huh to fi nd it in an unexpected place kiba laughs by himself but his eyes are filled with so much hatred that it made me shiver this photo is the start of a particular incident 13 high school dxd volume 3 life1 heat up occult research club part 1 bang the dull clanging of metal reverberated through the azure sky all right ive got this one i promptly caught the soaring baseball with my gloved hand nice catch ise buchou smiled and gave me a thumbs up we the occult research club we re practising baseball on the backyard of the old school building where no grass was growing nope this isnt a devils job next week is kuoh academys ball tournament its a battle between clubs that we cant lose so said buchou with a firm voice yeah one of the schools biggest events the ball tournament was closing in overall it is an event where we play ball related sports such
as baseball soccer basketball and tennis these matches include contests between classes genders and obviously there are also some between clubs whether or not you belong to a sports club its club mandatory naturally that includes the occult research club what the clubs actually play is announced on the day of the event we dont know what it will be w hen club member numbers differ the set up is for fair play at least number wise according to the student council announcement some sports may require more players so we need to make sure we have the reserves and in conclusion we were practising spor ts likely to arise today happens to be baseball as it was evening the sky was beginning to darken typically we spend our time chatting away in the club room recently we began to change into our pe uniforms and practice sports well while i dont hate moving around for fun for someone like me who trains in the morning my stamina is drained the entire day training in the morning lectures at school practising sports and devils jobs at night to tell you the truth it wouldnt be surprising if i died being
a devil is the only reason for my prolonged survival batting practice is fine now if its baseball then koneko will be the fourth batter affirmative well it is natural for the superhuman girl koneko chan to be the fourth batter no need to complain about that even if we voted on it koneko chan would win now well practice a knock 3 now everyone put your gloves on and spread out buchou was in high spirits she was so energetic and lively that she was basically on fire ufufufu buchou likes these kinds of things said akeno san while giggling i think i understand my onee sama hates to lose yep that s it of course theres no way that we can lose unless we make mistakes i consented as devils who are fundamentally stronger than humans on the sports day we will have to hold back naturally we wouldnt have a hard match on the flip side we had to learn the rules and features of baseball which is the reason why buchou is making us practice even if your brain knows your body has to as well said buchou quite an amazingly strong spirit thats our buchou
theory and practicality regardless of our superior physiques is necessary because we dont know what might happen here asia here i go klang14 high school dxd volume 3 buchou hit the ball towards asia haaan aaau aaau aaau aah the ball went through asias legs needless to say asias sports sense is bel ow exceptional at times shell even trip over nothing asia if you fail to catch it go fetch it yyes since the riser incident buchou started to show a lot of concern about matches she seemed to really regret that loss to riser however it is obvious that we were disadvantaged but the fact that we lost damaged buchous pride she did say she really wanted to win if only i werent useless next is yuuto here klang buchou hit the ball to kiba this should be a piece of cake for kiba hes the fastest runner in our group he can do pretty much anything is what i thought smack kiba stood there like an idiot and got hit hey hey hey kiba get a hold of yourself i yelled at kiba he then looked at me with a puzzled expression aah sorry i wasnt paying
attention kiba picked up the ball and threw it back to buchou buchou caught the ball with a sigh yuuto whats wrong youve been acting rather strange lately its not like you im sorry kiba sincerely apologised buchou was right this guy has been thinking about something serious lately even during discussions in the occult research club he would look somewhere else and not participate i even heard that it became a hot topic in his classroom a princ e in his thoughts the girls were worried and excited over his expression die handsome person is what i usually think but even i thought that he was acting strange lately this guy was always smiling so this was rather unexpected if my intuition is right he started acting strange after we had that club activity in my house was it the photo in the riser match his voice harboured some hatred while he spoke to the enemy knight apparently kiba is like this because of holy swords but that s that for now we have to work hard for the ball tournament hmmmm oh buchou picked up a baseball manual buchou tends to read when things come up quite a
book worm she is at home she reads some complicated texts ara ara by the way ise kun did you know asked akeno san know what recently buchou started a manual on love a love manual iim quite shocked for buchou to be reading a book about love does this mean she found someone that she likes my buchou getting touched by another man noooooo i dont want to think about it seeing me grabbing my head in shock akeno san began to laugh15 high school dxd volume 3 ufufufu ise kun you dont have to worry about it itll be all right its impossible for buchou to have a lover while youre around aare you sure ill believe in you ahhh if buchou were ever to get a boyfriend i would die if buchou were in your shoes shed be deeply shocked ufufufu its her first time youll be in trouble isekun while i didnt understa nd what akeno was trying to say its not a problem as long as buchou didnt fall for another man okay continuing buchou swung her bat once and the training recommenced part 2 lunch time the next day the ball tournament was approaching

most popular of course the most popular is rias buchou followed by akeno san she has a scary atmosphere that wont let anyone come near her its also because she has the eyes of a strict person but she is also quite the beauty shes more popular amongst female students than male students and she may be more popular than rias buchou and akeno san with girls if i looked carefully there was one other male student besides kaichou4 who is from the student council oh so you didnt mention us to hyoudou rias senpai its also weird not to notice us when we are devils as well isnt this the guy who joined the student counc il recently as a secretary of the council kaichou then said it quietly to the secretary guy saji it cant be helped because we are not supposed to contact each other at normal times also it hasnt been that long since he became a devil hyoudou kun is responding like he is supposed to whwhat by the way she just explained then that means that the people of the student council are also so there were other devils besides me and the members
of the occult research club akeno san explained to me who got really shocked the kaichou shitori souna samas real name is sona sitri shes a high class devil who is the next heir of the house of sitri18 high school dxd volume 3 hhighclass devil and the house of sitri im not actually sure about it but i know that its an important house just like buchous and the house of phoenix wha i became speechless i became really shocked to find out that there was another high class devil in this school akeno san then further explained to me the house of sitri is one of t he 72 pillars that survived the great war just like the house of gremory and the house of phoenix this school is actually controlled by the house of gremory but at day time it is the student councilin other words the house of sitri is in control the time of being in charge is split between day time and night time is that so then the members of the student council are the secretary guy spoke you guys are getting peaceful school life because kaichou and us the devil servants of
sitri are working at daytime it wont be bad for you to remember that you know by the way my name is saji genshirou im in second year and i am kaichous pawn oooh the same year as me and also the same pawn as me what an unexpected meeting i was a bit happy for there to be another pawn besides me and also in the same year as me the secretary guy saji made an opposite reaction to me and made a sigh actually you damaged my pride very badly for you one of the three pervs to be the same pawn as me wwhat did you say this bastard i was thinking of getting along with him oh you wan na go at it even if i look like this im a pawn that consumed 4 pieces of pawns even if i just turned into a devil i wont lose against someone like hyoudou saji made a provoking comment against me but kaichou glared at him sharply saji stop that bubut kaichou the reason we came here is to introduce our new servants amongst fellow high class devils where we both have this school as our bas
e in other words it is a meeting to introduce you and riass servants hyoudou kun and asia san if you are my servant then dont make a shame out of me besides kaichou then looked at me saji you cant win against hyoudou kun right now he is the one who defeated the third son of the house of phoenix consuming 8 pawn pieces was not just for show 8 pieces wait this is the guy who defeated the phoenix for this guy to beat that riser i thought that it was kiba or himejima senpai who res cued rias senpai what what what are they on about also can you stop looking at me with those weird eyes im not an animal in the zoo that is doing something weird then kaichou bowed her head down i am sorry hyoudo issei kun asia argento san my servant hasnt experienced as much battles as you two so he still has some rude attitude in him if its okay can you please get along with him kaichou said it to us while smiling i think you call this a cold smile i didnt feel anything bad from the smile so
she must be a person who can only smile like this saji eh yeyes please get along with me saji also bowed his head down at me reluctantly he seemed like he wasnt satisfied with it yes lets get along asia replied back with a big smile asia sure is a good child19 high school dxd volume 3 if its asia san then i am very happy saji grabbed asias hand and made an attitude opposite to the one he gave me thithis bastard i took sajis hands off asias and shook his hand while gripping it hard hahaha saji kun please look after me as well also ill seriously fucking kill you if you lay a finger on asia okay saji kun i said it with a fake smile then he also smiled and held my hand stronger yes yes lets get along hyoudou kun to have the blond bishoujo for just yourself you really are a brute kun man i wish there was a divine punishment which falls on you i wish you die when a lightning falls on you while you are on your way home we made negative comments against each other it must have looked
weird but i couldnt forgive this guy he was different than kiba but i couldnt stand guys like him actually i seriously wanted to hit him i seriously wont let him walk alive if he touches asia you must have a hard time you too buchou and kaichou both made a sigh while looking at us chi members of the student council are stronger than the members of your club saji said it while letting go of my hand so the members of the student council belong to kaichous household and are kaichous servants kaichou took a sip of green tea and said it with a small voice i love this school i also think that the work of the student council is worth the effort thats why i will not forgive those that ruin the peaceful life of this school whether they are human or devils that applies to you the people in here and also rias i understood immediately that those words were directed to us the new devils which are me asia and saji in other words she will not forgive anyone that ruins the school life so this person loves this school kuoh academy that much
no wonder she is the kaichou i think this is enough for introducing our rookies then we will pardon ourselves now theres also a document which i want to finish during lunch time kaichou got up and tried to leave kaichou no souna sitri sansama i will be in your care from now yyes please take care of us i bowed my head towards kaichou and greeted her and asia did the same its a greeting as a newbie devil she is a high class devil and also buchous acquaintance even if her servant is that i think its an obvious thing to do as a new devil of the gremory household yes lets get along kaichou replied and smiled at us rias i will be looking forward to the ball tournament kaichou said to buchou with a smile before she left the room yes me as well buchou smiled back at her oh i understood immediately that these two are really close then she could have helped us in the quarrel between the old ho uses from the previous incident but then i thought that its not that simple to put your head inside the problems between high class
devils or did she believe that buchou would be able to clear the problem herself kaichou left the room after saying that ise asia get along with saji kun you will also meet the other members of the student council who are devils but dont fight with them since we are all spending our school life at the same school okay20 high school dxd volume 3 buchou said to us while smiling yes if buchou says that then i will listen to her without complaining i wont fight even though that guy is a jerk but for there to be devils besides us at this school seems like there are more secrets within this school part 4 bang bang the sound of the start of the ball tournament echoed in the sky from todays weather broadcast its going to rain in the evening please dont rain until the tournament finishes tsukmoto kun of the manga research club hashioka sensei is calling you can you please c ome to the teachers room immediately the pa which is placed throughout the school ground was making announcements endlessly all of us members got changed into our pe uniform and gathered at one place
and were resting up till the start of the match but the club matches were at the end first of all there were the class matches i think my class is going to compete in baseball me and asia also have to participate the practice we did after school wasnt in vain after that there was a match amongst genders then after lunch there was a match between clubs i did some light exercises as a warm up asia was stretching with the help of akeno san koneko chan was sitting on the plastic mattress on the ground reading the rule book for ball games kibawas s till thinking about something he had been staring at the sky buchou went to check the category sports for the club matches oh she came back buchou who just came back was smiling fearlessly fufufu we have won this match already buchou so what is the sports we are playing then dodgeball i only had a bad feeling about this part 5 buchouuuuuu you can do it i was cheering for buchou from the tennis court fence sobbuchou in a tennis uniform the thigh you could see from the mini skirt was wonderful
buchou was representing the girls of her class and was competing against other senior girls slam buchou was playing around with her opponent with her smooth move but the opponent was quite good as well kaichou samaaaaa kyaaaa the girls were shouting with a shrill voice yes buchous opponent was none other than the student president shitori souna senpai ufufufu its wonderful that we can see a match between high class devils in a place like this akeno san was also enjoying w atching it beside me it was just like she said i never expected that there would be a match between the high class devils here and both of them werent holding back they were seriously hitting the ball with their racket here i come sona yes you may rias21 high school dxd volume 3 both of them were exchanging words like that and they were both really into this match it looked like a situation in a sports comedy manga even i was getting fired up just looking at them kaichouuuuu please winnnnnnn ah saji was also c heering in the fence opposite of me he was even swinging a flag which had a writing student council
on it wow hes also fired up take this shitori style spin ball the ball kaichou had just hit went rushing towards buchou you are too nave take this gremory style counter buchou tried to hit it back with her racket but the ball changed its direction and went down uoooooo is it a magic ball 1530 noooooo its kaichous point you are doing well souna to be expected from my rival ufufu rias you havent forgotten the promise where the loser has to pay for the udon with all the toppings at kobashiya have you yes i havent it will be my shame if you taste that before me thats why i will definitely win did you know that i have 108 styles of magic ball i will accept that challenge i will hit back all the balls that come into my shitori zone i dont know why but both of their eyes were burning but princesses why is the thing you two are betting socommon well maybe thats the good thing about buchou and kaichou maybe they started to have sense as human because they lived in the humans world for so long after all the final match
between buchou and kaichou lasted so long that both of their rackets broke and they both got first places well of course a normal racket would break if they do an intense rally like that then the tournament moved to the club matches part 6 bloobloomers i became shocked after seeing what asia was wearing it was not the schools pe uniform shorts but a bloomer before the start of the club matches asia suddenly disappeared and when i thought she came back she was wearing a bloomer ooooher white legsher thighs man she has nice legs like always asia was wriggling while making her face red ummmi heard from kiryuu san that the proper uniform for dodge ball is bloomer anand also that ise san will be happy if i wore this kikiryuuuuuuuu that damn bitch why on earth did she teach my cute asia chan this wonder fulno i mean shameless thing shit kiryuus also known as master mind actions are shaking my heart you dont like it asia asked me with a shy voice while looking up at me i felt something burst inside me no no its great asia tha nk you very much thank you

worried about you worried who worries about who i think its normal for devils to live by how they want well i think im at fault for not listening to my master this time hmmm maybe i should tell him a bit but why am i supposed to do this its usually the other way around i say something insane and kiba calms me down its troublesome a situation like this when we are trying to form a proper group thats how we felt after we went through that bitter experience in the previous match remember dont we have to cover for each others weak points from now on we are comrades comrades kiba then made a gloomy face yes comrades you are always burning ise kun lately i started to remember the basic things basic yeah thats right the reason why i am fighting isnt it for buchou thats what i thought thats what i believed in hard just by my own thinking but he rejected it immediately no im living so i can seek my revenge holy sword excalibur destroying that is the reason why i am living kiba had a face with a strong determination that time
i thought that i had s een his real face27 high school dxd volume 3 revenge knight im walking without using an umbrella under the heavy rain i think its a good rain that can cool my head off i had a fight with buchou i rebelled for the first time against my master who saved my life it was a failure as kiba yuuto however i had never once forgotten my revenge towards the holy sword excalibur i was just getting senile with the lifestyle at school i had made comrades obtained a lifestyle and received a name i also received a pur pose in life from my master rias gremory asking for more happiness is a bad thing its certainly bad until i achieve my purpose i have never thought that i can continue to live on behalf of my comrades splash i heard a sound of water that is dif ferent from the sound of rain there is a priest in front of me by hanging a cross around their neck they speak of the holiness in the name of god that i so despise they are one of the things i hate the target of my
hatred i even think that i dont mi nd killing him if he is an exorcist the priest has a blood patch on his stomach and when he coughs out some blood he falls down was he attacked by someone who an enemy sensing an abnormal presence i created a demonic sword instantly it s a killing intent spark there is a reflection of a metal under the rain then theres a spark when i move my body towards the place where the killing intent is coming from there is someone wielding a long sword who comes to attack me this person is wearing same clothes as the priest that just died front of me a priest except this one is giving off a powerful killing intent clearly yahooo its been a while i know the boy priest who is giving a disgusting smile a white haired crazy priest fr eed sellzen hes the one we fought in the previous incident involving the fallen angels he is showing the same disgusting smile that is ticking me off like before looks like you are still in this town what is your business today im sorry but im in a really bad
mood today i said that with an angry tone but he simply laughs it off well thats good timing wonderful in my case im so happy that im going to shed some tears because of my reunion with you28 high school dxd volume 3 so he still has his cocky wa y of talking seriously he really does get on my nerves i already hate him for being a priest when i try to make a demonic sword in my left hand the long sword he is wielding starts to emit a holy aura that light that aura that glow how can i forget i was getting bored of priest hunting so this really is a good timing very good nice timing indeed my excalibur and your demonic sword can you let me check which one is stronger hyahahahaha i will repay you by killing you yes the sword he has is the holy sword excalibur itself29 high school dxd volume 3 life2 the holy sword has arrived part 1 holy sword project buchou nodded at my words yes yuuto is a survivor of that project asia buchou and i returned to my house after we finished our club activities
buchou and asia came into my room and buchou had started to tell us about kiba there was a project several years ago inside the christian church that aimed to make those who can wield the holy sword excalibur this is my first time hearin g this asia didnt know about this project well a secret project like this wont reach the ears of the girl who was praised as the holy maiden holy swords are the ultimate weapons against devils if we the devils touch the holy sword then we will burn ourselves if we get cut by it then we will be terminated without a trace it could be called the ultimate weapon for those who believe in god and see devils as an enemy holysword its those things that also come up in games and light novels right im a devil so it would be the most dangerous weapon for me as well even though there are numerous holy swords originating from all over the world i still think the most famous one would be excalibur even in japan it comes up in many books its a holy weapon that is created through means of magic and
alchemy by those who reach the territory of god but holy swords choose their wielders i hear that only one person in a decade or so gets chosen kiba is a sacred gear possessor that can create demonic swords right so isnt there a sacred gear that can create holy swords instead it was my question i made a simple conclusion that a sacred gear that can create holy swords exists because a sacred gear that creates demonic sword does its not like there arent but if you compare it to the holy swords that already exist it is kind of lacking of course im not saying its weak among them there is a sacred utensil included in the longinus just like your boosted gear the most famous is the sac red gear that was wielded by the person who killed jesus christ the true longinus its also said that the name longinus was derived from it longinus it is a sacred gear that has the power to kill god like the one i possess in my left arm so there is a sacred utensil that is a sacred gear and is also a longinus but to hear that the
spear that killed jesus san was also a longinus i was discovering the mystery behind the history from out of nowhere talking to a high class devil can be real ly shocking except at this point there isnt a holy sacred gear that can compete with excalibur durandal or ama nomurakumo notsurugi because these holy swords are too powerful its the same with the demonic swords hmmmm so much stuff that i had no clue about ill probably have to remember these things but lately there is so much stuff that i have to remember its hard to keep up yuuto received artificial treatment to adapt to the holy sword particularly the excalibur so kiba is able to use the holy swords buchou shook her head at my question yuuto couldnt adapt to the holy swords not only yuuto but it seems like everyone who received a treatment similar to yuutos couldnt either30 high school dxd volume 3 even kiba who is an expert at using swords and can handle all those demonic swords couldnt use the holyswords the people of the church decided to view the ones who couldnt adapt to the holy swords as defective products and disposed
of them dispose sounds like an unpleasant word i can imagine w hat it means buchous eyes changed because she also felt discomfort most of the people experimented on were killed including yuuto only because they couldnt adapt to the holyswords it cant be its not an acceptable act by those who serve god it seems like this was a big shock for asia her eyes were covered with tears it is normal to cry when something you believe in continues to betray you they the people of the church call us devils an evil existence but i think the bad intentions of humans are the greatest evil in this world buchou said it with sad eyes buchou is a devil but she is very kind buchou told me that she has similar feelings as humans because she stayed in the humans world for too long but i believe thats not the case i think that buchou was a kind woman right from the start otherwise you cant explain her kind smile there are also kind people among the devils and that is my pride of being a devil when i reincarnated yuuto into a devil that boy was swearing
for his revenge even when he was in a critical situation because his talents were being used for holy swords since he was born i wanted him to use his talents as a devil yuutos talent at using swords would be a waste for only using it for holy swords buchou wanted to save kiba by turning him into a devil because he had a miserable life due to the holy swords she wanted to tell him not to get so fixated on holy swords and use his powers as a devil but kiba that boy couldnt forget about it the holy swords those who were involved with the holy swords and the people of the church the reason why he detests priests the reason why he is obsessed with the information regarding holy swords he still couldnt forget about them no they played around w ith his life and killed him afterwards its not weird for him to hold a grudge when i was killed by that fallen angel i also held a grudge against her and it happened to him when he was little so his hatred against them must be enormous buchou made a big sigh anyway
i will just watch over him for now right now his head is full of the feelings he has towards the holyswords but i hope he returns to his usual self ah about that i think this photo was what caused him to act like this i handed t he photo to buchou kiba said the sword in this photo is a holy sword i think it is somehow related buchous eyes changed as soon as she saw the photo ise is there someone you know who is related to the church no theres none among my relatives thats what my parents told me i asked them just in case except when i was really small it seems there was a child who was a christian living in the neighbourhood so there is one near you no there was a holy sword in this area about 10 years ago its so terrifying then is that sword really a holy sword31 high school dxd volume 3 yes its one of the holy swords its not as powerful as the legendary holy sword i mentioned before but its the real thing then it must mean that this man is the holy sword
wielder now i get it i heard that my predecessor who was in charge of this area vanished but it would make sense if this was the reason but if i remember oh buchou started talking to herself seems like she found out something but buchou thought for a while a nd lets go to sleep even if we think about it its not like yuutos behaviour will go back to normal after saying that buchou started to strip her clothes bubuchou why are you taking your clothes off here why you also know that i cant sl eep without being naked ise no no no not that i mean why are you taking them off in my room i was eagerly looking at buchous body while i was panicking ngggggggg no matter how many times i look at them she has an amazing body her boobs bounced after she took her bra off thats because im going to sleep with you buchou answered me as if it was the obvious answer nose bleed my nose started to drip lots of blood ooooooooh for a girl to say that she wants to sleep with me then im sleeping here as
well im also going to sleep with ise san hey hey hey hey im happy to hear that but you cant asia cant do that she shouldnt be copying buchou buchou you are being a bad influence on asia please put your clothes on buchou frowned her eyebrows at my words bad influence thats a harsh thing to say ise you know that i sleep naked right you slept with me a number of times this time it was asia who responded to buchous words slept together a number of times noise san and buchou san asia started to shake and get teary eyes because it was a big shock for her hohold on what kind of situation is this asia hand over ise for tonight i dont want to i think i have the right to be spoiled by ise san as well i also want to sleep with ise san asia you wanted to sleep with me that much i feel a bit complicated but also really happy even though she has teary eyes she seems determined i can tell from what shes said that she wont back down waaaaah a fight is about to start in my
room lets not fight both of them glared at each other and there were sparks between them im trying to breathe in this awkward situation its really hard to breathe here it truly is then l ets make ise decide buchou then looked at me her eyes were telling me choose me i can feel a force coming from her eyes isesan you will sleep with me right32 high school dxd volume 3 asia asked me with sobbing eyes i felt like surrendering to her because she wasnt ac ting the person whom i wont pick will hold a grudge against me i held my head down because this was the hardest choice ive ever faced part 2 fuuu i took a breath after i drank a cup of water in the kitchen after that i calmed the s ituation down by choosing to sleep with both of them of course making buchou wear her night gown just for today at that rate asia would also have copied her it seems like asia will become erotic because of buchous influence well that would make me feel happy but at the same time would leave me with complicated feelings i need
to protect asia the girl you are trying to protect becoming eroticit might be a good thing but it might be a bad thing as well nggggh its something that my small brain cant handle on the bed buchou and asia were sleeping while i slept between them its a situation i dreamed of this is a wonderful thing im sleeping while being surrounded by two girls you know it would be the ultimate situatio n for guys and if i think of laying my hand on buchou who sleeps on the left side of me it seems like asia would get mad at me if i lay my hand on asia who sleeps on the right side then the good will inside me will tell myself not to its killing me damn it they are right in front of me but i cant lay my hands on them i held my head down with my arms while shedding tears of regrets of course i couldnt go to sleep because i was getting too excited since there were two bishoujo sleeping next to me i stopped my urge to grope breasts and thighs and came downstairs when i saw a
chance i was sure the two of them were sleeping peacefully shit i want to have sex with them isnt this the time in my life where i am popular with girls shouldnt i use this as a chance to experience a lot of things maybe do something erotic with the three of us is it even possible in a harem having threesomes is normal i heard its the basic stuff then this means i am not fit to make my own harem if i had a talent for making a harem then by now i would have made buchou and asia feel pleasured and have them in my grasp holy shit i understood another painful reality i cant even do anything when im sleeping with two girls i mean it seems that i can lay my hand on buchou but i cant and i cant make asia impure is it because im too inexperienced that i think like that is it because im a virgin absurd in the simulation i made in my head it goes like this fufufu so which girl should i pleasure today isesama please pick me i beg you what are you talking about im
a slut that cant live without masters penis so please pick me dont get in my way onii sama i cant endure it anymore i beg you please come inside me hahaha hey hey give me a break i only have one body you know so make a row so choose the order nicely hahaha what troublesome kittens you are in my head it was perfect but reality is harsh there was a tear falling down my cheek after all it was just a halluci nation that i made in my head aaaah when am i going to have my first sex i think its about a good time for having sex once with a girl huh never impossible because i have already seen boobs many times and the next step after that is hard sob why did it turn out like this hey partner sorry to bother you i never expected that you would have started a conversation with me the being residing in my left arm the sacred gear boosted gear the welsh dragon ddraig he suddenly talked to me soon after the rating game against the house of phoenix and he rented me the power balance breaker
which is the ultimate power of sacred gears thanks to that i defeated riser phoenix and succeeded in destroying buchous engagement but that time my left arm turned into that of a dragon which is the price for using that power now my arm is back to normal because of buchou and akeno sans help but if i dont receive the treatment to weaken my dragon power then my arm will revert back to a dragons arm33 high school dxd volume 3 you didnt even appear since then and didnt even talk back to me when i was calling you dont say that i wont run away this time lets talk a bit i sat down on the sofa in the living room hmph coming out of nowhere nah dont say that did the dragon power inside me become full is that the reason why this guy is talking to me tomorrow is the day akeno san is going to scatter my powers gufufu i cant wait for tomorrow that is so erotic i cant stop myself from drooling seems like your head is full of things like that as always ddraig said it while making a sigh shut up
im at that age and what did you want to talk about i dont mind talking about the opposite sex you were listening well i am always with you so i c an hear it whether i want to or not is that so so you can hear everything and its even worse because it seems like he can hear my thoughts as well the gremory and their servants are beings with extra ordinary affection among the devils your master and friends are the same as well especially the love rias gremory has towards you is deep seems like she adores you a lot yeah i dont know why but she adores me a lot i answered him while blushing thats right i am being especially taken care of by buchou i think she started to adore me even more after i beat riser even in front of the other club members the other servant devils she hugs me i even get kissed on the cheek sometimes im happy but also embarrassed so i dont know what to do kukuku you are probably at the age where you should experience that stuff you should experience that kind of stuff as
soon as you can you wont know when the white guy will appear in front of you hey i wanted to ask you before but what is that white guy you always talk about the white dragon vanishing dragon va vanishingdragon is it related to ddraig the welsh dragon if i remember ddraig is called seki ryutei 1 1 then the white dragon is ddraig talked to me while i was thinking about it you know that the three sides of god and angels fallen angels and devils were having a big war a long time ago right yeah that time other powers gave their support to certain sides fairies spirits european monsters asian youkai and humans but the dragons were the only beings that didnt side with any of them why was that hmmm i wonder i dont know the actual reason but dragons are beings that are made from a mass of powers and they all act freely and selfishly there were dragons that turned into devils or those that sided with god but the majority of them didnt care about the war and lived freely wow dragons are such troublesome creatures they live how they want to
but during the great war between the three powers there were two stupid dragons that started a fight and those two were in the highest class of dragons and they had a power that rivalled that of god and the34 high school dxd volume 3 maou1 2 they started to fight each other while taking down the guys of the three powers for the three powers there wasnt anything more troublesome than these two dragons the three powers were having a serious war to take control of this world and the two dragons were disturbing the battlefield without any care those two are the worst they are just super troublesome dragons why were the two fighting that much no idea its like they werent interested in anything at all the two dragons probably cant remember the reason why they started to fight and for the first time the leaders of the three powers joined hand s we have to get rid of those two dragons or else its not a matter of war any more like that the groups who are enemies forming an alliance and the reason for that is a fight between dragons it seems complicated the two
dragons that got their fight interrupted became mad dont get in the way of our fight a mere god and maou shouldnt be interrupting a duel between dragons they responded like idiots they went head on and tried to eat god maou and the leaders of the fallen angels w ell that was a mistake i guess they seriously are the ultimate and worst dragons but i get it now so those two dragons are in the end the two dragons got cut into pieces and their spirits were sealed within human bodies as sacred gears the two dr agons that were sealed within humans used them as vessels they encountered each other and fought each other countless times every time one of them won and one of them died sometimes one of them was already dead before the other one came and so they didnt fight but most of the times they did if the vessel human dies then the dragons stop functioning for a certain time their spirits float around in this world until the humans with dragon powers are born that cycle has repeated countless times for ma ny long years and those two dragons are you
and the vanishing dragon huh yeah thats right this time it was you who became my host and you even became a devil in all the long years i have been like this this is a first time thats why i am look ing forward to it i wonder whats going to happen this time hey hey you possessed me without my permission so dont go around looking forward to whats going to happen to my life but it might be a good idea to convey my dream to him i cleared my throat and roared with my strongest voice listen up ddraig i want to get promoted to a high class devil and become a harem king my dream is to form an army of bishoujo by making lots of girls my personal servant devils ddraig became speechless for a m oment and started laughing hahaha its also my first time having a host like you as well most of the hosts in the past either got too proud of our powers or too terrified of our powers with none of them living a decent life huh am i abnormal am i weird you are weird but not abnormal
either way you are a being that is possessed by a dragon in whatever age and country dragons represent power you know how even though they come in many different forms and shapes there are pictures and carvings of dragons in many different countries throughout the ages humans admired dragons respected dragons and feared dragons unwittingly dragons fascinate those around them or those with power gather around the dragons if there are people who come to you with admiration or to challenge you then its most likely the power of the dragon it sounds like an inconvenient power so am i going to be targeted by a lot of guys to fight strong foes that are attracted to power thats the path of those who p ossess the dragon emperor but you dont have to be pessimistic women would come to you as well are you serious35 high school dxd volume 3 yeah im serious all of my hosts were surrounded by the opposite sex i think you call them popular right they didnt have to worry about the opposite sex at all then there are some people who hadse ssesex with a girl there was a guy who slept
with a different woman every night whwhaaaaat my previous senpais were doing that kind of stuff thats so wonderful beautiful u uhyouuuuuuuuuu i screamed out of joy within myself this is amazing seriously amazing uooooooo are you serious you no you sir are an amazing sacred gear like that i bowed my head down and spoke to him with respect i mean i didnt know tha t this sacred gear was an amazing item like that that information became a light of hope to me you are suddenly looking at me with respect and are talking to me with respect its certainly my first time having a host like you who changes his attitude like that what are you talking about ddraig sensei im not in a position to say rude things to you aaaah sensei i will be under your care from now on you seriously are a man who is hard to understand but certainly its going to get interesting well let us both not get killed by vanishing dragon then oh yeah by the way is the vanishing dragon strong hes strong to begin with we had powers that could even dominate god and maou its just
that we had a curse put on us when we got turned into sacred gears we are in a tight situation to release our full powers even so if you get used to it high class devils and high ranked angels are nothing against us i get it now so if i and the guy who possess the vanishing dragon mas ter how to use our sacred gears then we can become that powerful but to tell the truth im not interested in defeating god or maou but it might be awesome to become a maou and gather girls i have antagonism against fallen angels but i dont want to encounter their leaders but would i end up meeting the vanishing dragon whether i want to or not who is the possessor its obvious that its someone that i dont know but i hope it is a girl im going to live my life to the fullest without getting drag ged into the destiny of dragons i will also improve myself so i dont lose to the vanishing dragon either way my current aim is buchous oppai 1 3 with buchous oppai im going to you are going to grope
it no im going to suck it i said it to him clearly i dont know why but the emperor of dragons became silent did he lose his words i continued on without caring about i t the sensation of buchous oppai i can still feel it within my hands if i get another chance i want to grope it for a whole day even buchou might give it to me as a treat for her servant but thats not enough guys have to aim higher guys who be come satisfied with groping oppai are second rate lechers thats why im going to suck her oppai i is that so well do your best ddraig sounded shocked by my words but im serious emperor of dragons ddraig i will be borrowing your powers supporting to suck a womans tits huh seems like i went down hard but that may also be fun having a partner like this sometimes might be good he seemed like he agreed to it even though he made a sigh he seems to see me at weird times ou lets w ork together partner36 high school dxd volume 3 yeah you are right partner like this
me and the emperor of dragons made a promise for our new objective at midnight part 3 to scatter the powers of a dragon that is to nullify it by getting the power taken away by high level de vils there are a couple of methods to do this but the easiest and the most certain one is to take it out directly from that person the way i am getting it done iswell its certainly stimulating for a lecherous student like me the only high level devils who can do that to me are buchou and akeno san both of them take turns at taking out my dragon powers today is the day i get my dragon powers taken out and i am currently in a room on the second floor of the old school building which is used by akeno san it used to be a classroom but now there is a tatami japanese flooring on the floor and it looks like a traditional japanese room there are symbols around the room that look like certain casting spells and there are also casting items in the ro om i was waiting in the middle of the room with
my upper body naked theres also a magic circle below the place i was sitting i heard that this was a necessary thing for rituals theres also a meaning for why i didnt have anything on my upper body this is required for the ritual the door opened and someone entered the room the person who appeared was akeno san with a white cloth on she had her usual ponytail untied as well i always think about it every time i do this ritual but akeno san with her hair down looks fascinating and attractive she smiled at me once and then she quietly sat in front of me very sacredly the preparations are done now we shall begin umummmm akeno san the white cloth that is covering akeno sans body is soaked w ith water her long black hair is also sticking to the cloth and it looks sexy i can see her skin if i can see it like this a certain thing of mine is going to change i mean i can see it i can see it through the cloth the pink coloured thing i c an see her nipples wait she doesnt have her bra
on ara ara did something happen you suddenly became quiet is something wrong with what i am wearing the reason why it is soaked is because i put water onto myself for the ritual is it weird akeno san started to pat herself on her chest on purpose its affecting my crotch no no you look really great in it i couldnt help myself staring at akeno sans chest its just that her see through clothes are too stimulating for me huh is it just me or isnt she wearing anything down there as well i then looked around her hips i became speechless she isnt wearing anythingi think she doesnt seem to be shy about it and isnt even trying to hide it its more like she is enjoying my reaction lets start ise kun please give me your left arm yyes i will be in your care the way to scatter the power of a dragon that is to suck the dragons energy directly from ise kuns finger pulling accumulated energy out of your left arm if i do this your arm would temporary revert back to its original state yes by getting it directly sucked through my
body the ritual is complete in my case my problem is solved by buchou and akeno san sucking the dragons power through my finger chup making an obscene water sound akeno san put my index finger into her mouth39 high school dxd volume 3 ku its a sensation i cant describe with words i thought about it many times but it feels so amazing inside a girls mouth it feels slippery but warm and the lips feel so soft furthermore my finger is sucked with chu chu sounds this sucking dangerously stimulates me it feels really amazing aaaah everything is getting pink coloured inside my head amazing this is too amazing an act that surpasses any act in porno videos is happening to me chupi chupa churu while sucking my finger akeno san was making obscene sounds on purpose its as if she was enjoying my reaction as for me i could only tremble slightly with my face completely red letting my body enjoy the pleasure of being sucked aaaah im definitely going to save this memory in my head for eternity wait if i think about it i will be receiving this from now on uoooooooooooooo this is the
best indeed i couldnt have gotten this if my arm didnt change into that of a dragon ddraig right now i am experiencing the best moment in my life it was an erotic situation like that but i could feel the wave of power within my left arm gathering at my finger tip and di sappearing and the weight i felt in my left hand was disappearing as well my left arm was getting relaxed it felt like the presence of ddraig was fading then was i right about the fact that if my dragons power becomes dense then ddraigs conscious als o becomes dense when i was thinking about that lick uheee i accidentally slipped my voice thats because akeno san suddenly licked my finger she started to swirl around my finger with the tip of her tongue wai wait akeno san when i looked akeno san had a naughty face and it looked like the sadist personality of hers got turned on my finger that came out of her mouth had a thread of akeno sans saliva uheee its too erotic ara ara if you make a cute reaction like that then i feel like givi ng you
more service seservice yes i also dont think its a bad thing to adore my kouhaijunior akeno san started to suck my finger again and put her body closer towards me eeeeeeeeh aakeno san wait a second whats going on by ignoring my confused reaction she put a smile on and hugged me i can smell the nice smell of her silky black hair no i can smell a fragrance from akeno sans body that insanely shakes my manhood since i had nothing on my upper body and akeno san was wearing a really thin cloth i could feel her body directly it felt cold because her cloth was wet but i could feel the warmth from her body temperature and her body temperature felt so erotic that my head was about to go crazy aakeno sans body is so soft i can feel the sensation of her oppai just through the cloth buhaa there was blood coming out of my nose of course even i have a dozen of liters of blood coming out it still wont stop akeno san whispered into my ears while i was stiff like a rock even i act like this i have a
great liking towards you ise kun mme yes first i thought of you as a cute junior but its different lately in the fight against the phoenix last time i saw you standing up no matter how many times you were beaten do wn from the infirmary room aaaah if i remember correctly akeno san retired during the match and she was sent to the infirmary room and you came to the engagement party to save buchou you even defeated phoenix who is said to be immortal even i will b e aroused if i see a man fighting wonderfully like that aaroused akeno san looked directly at me and chuckled40 high school dxd volume 3 ufu sometimes i think about you and the area around my breast gets hot and i cant help it but when i try to make you enjoy something like this the instinct of a bully inside me rises is this love is this love huh and i am being bullied theres sexual bullying like this the world is big indeed but if i lay my hands on you rias might get mad that persontruly sees you uf ufu you are a sinful man ise
kun sin me i will receive any kind of punishment so please let me continue this situation huh did akeno san call buchou rias do they call each other by their names when they are alone akeno san and buchou seems to know each other longer than the rest of the club members then akeno san put her arms around my neck and she purposely exposed her body i could see the peach coloured nipple on her right boob i could see it clearly she was even exposing most of her legs do you want to have an affair with me aaffair affair against whom but the word affair really turns me on ufufufu i will keep quiet about whats going to happen now from buchou and asia chan exciting isnt it a secret between us drip dr ip drip drip my nosebleed didnt seem to stop it continued to flow out of my nose i also want to experience at least once to get devoured by a younger boy with lust i also have masochism within me as well i think its about a good time for having a m an inside me now for once plpplease stop to

do it with either of them i do want to do it i really do im keeping down my urge to push her down on my bed but i cant go past the last step and i always end up crying every night i also want to have sex with buchou and asia aaaaah i ended up telling her my true feelings but they are my honest thoughts it cant be helped if a boy my age has lots of sexual urges when he has to live with two b ishoujo41 high school dxd volume 3 poor youara ara then both of you are slow at these things im sure you could do it if you were willing to do it then it seems like i cant take your purity without her permission crap i was about to be taken did i say something unnecessary was i able to graduate from being a virgin wait hold on did i make a stupid mistake suddenly the door opened when i looked in that direction buchou was there staring with angry eyes akeno whats the meaning of this buchou approached us with an unpleasant voice oh crapshes angry ufufu i was just
scattering the power of the dragon akeno san answered unconcernedly she had her smile on is that so but no matter how you look at itwerent you trying to do something beyond that ara ara i wasnt thinking of doing it even if you werent there is a limit even i havent isnt that because you are taking it slow it might be good reading a book about it but it wont go as smoothly as in the manual they werent glaring at each other but buchou and akeno san were looking at each other in the eyes somehow i could feel the intensity uuuummm i dont know how to describe this situation i put my shirt on quickly and tried not to get close to them then buchou glared at me and pinched my cheek ouch ise it seems like you were having fun did you get close to the akeno oneesama that you admire so much wowwon i i couldnt speak properly because i had my cheeks pinched but making up an excus e didnt seem manly so i stopped saying anything even i was getting into the flow i was looking forward to it then do whatever
you want buchou made an angry face and left the room bang even the way she closed the door was violent sob i was yelled at by buchou why is it because i was about to do something naughty with akeno san akeno san whispered to me when i was confused jealousy she sure is cute ufufufu ise kun it seems like you are making progress in your relationship what do you mean hmmmmm i dont understand what she means by progress did she think that i would be taken by akeno san im buchous servant so there is no way that i will be akeno sans servant but i thought that buchou looked cute when she made an angry face like asia part 4 asia and i were on our way home after we finished school and club activities usually buchou would be with us but today she wasnt it seems like the incident with akeno san was the cause buchou arent you going home i will be going home afterwards go home without me i asked her at the club room but not only did she not look at my eyes she didnt even face me there were
thorns in her words sobdoes buchou hate me now im sad do dogs who are scolded by their masters feel like this as well its so lonely andso sad42 high school dxd volume 3 isnt buchou san going home with us hm yeah it seems like i made buchou angry did you do something asia asked me with a worried face but i couldnt tell her about the incident with akeno san here it would get even more complicated no but its my fault i will apologise to her afterwards asia you dont have to worry about it i understand but it might be my fault lately i have been talking back to buchou san asia said it with an apolo getic voice asia does look at buchou as a rival but i dont think thats the case the cause is definitely the thing with me and akeno san its okay i dont think she is mad at you asia its my fault well i am lewd but i thought that buchou was okay with me being lewd she didnt even say anything when i said that i was aiming to become a harem king weird buchou is a bit
weird lately or is it that she has the desire to keep her servants only to herself is it the same as people who gets disturbed when their pets are tamed by another person even if i am adored by buchou i still am just a servant to her sobif i am getting troubled by just one girl like this then my dream of becoming a harem king is far away shit is the reason why i wasnt popular with girls related a maidens heart its so complicated if i dont understand this then i will never win against the good looking guys i was thinking like this till we reached my house when i tried to open the front door i felt something bad shiver what is this it felt like there was a signal within my body forewarning me of danger i had felt a similar feeling like this before if i remember it was the time when i met asia for the first time and took her to the church when i saw the church my body trembled grip asia grabbed my hand with her shaking hands it seems like asia also felt something unpleasant then this
is the feeling that can only be felt by devils there is someone inside my house no it cant be mum i imagined my mu m in danger in my head and opened the door quickly i took my shoes off and headed straight off to the kitchen it must be a joke mum no it cant be is the fact that i am a devil revealed by whom fallen angels god angels people related to the chur ch any of those are dangerous they would cut down and kill any of those related to us without mercy in my head i started to remember the dead body that was killed by that shit priest freed the corpse that was cut many times by him my mother is going to turn out like that shit dont fuck around that kind of thing that will not happen mum wasnt in the kitchen but i heard laughter from the living room i went there quickly and saw two unfamiliar girls and mum who was laughing and this is a pi cture of ise when he was in primary school look this is the picture when his togs got ripped at the swimming
pool it was very troublesome he went to the pools slide with his togs ripped mu mum mum looked at me when she realised i was there oh ise welcome back what happened you look pale hauuuuu im so glad asia sat down on the ground as if she was relieved after i found out my mum was safe i took a deep breath and calmed down but i couldnt get rid of my uneasiness of course because there were two unfamiliar women they were both young foreigners with a rosario hanging around their chest both of them looked about my age one had chestnut coloured hair and the other one had blue hair with a green43 high school dxd volume 3 mesh and scary eyes both of them w ere quite beautiful but by the way they behaved even i could tell they were no ordinary people both of them were wearing a white robe are they related to the church an exorcist thats bad i cant fight in a place like this hello hyoudou issei kun the woman with chestnut hair smiled at me next to her was the girl with green mesh and there was a weapon
covered in cloth next to her thats it i can feel foreboding danger from that weapon i can feel something very unpleasant from it with my skin its probably something to destroy us devils nice to meet you i greeted her with a fake smile but her eyes changed and she looked puzzled huh dont you remember its me huh the chestnut haired girl pointed at herself no no i dont remember you mum gave a photo to me because i looked confused its the photo with the holy sword mum pointed at the boy who i was friends with when i was small its this child shidou irina chan that time she was like a boy but now she is a proper lady so even i was shocked excuse me this girlis the boy who lived in the neighbourhood when i was small and the one i often played with eeeeeeeeh the boy in the picture it was a girl it wasnt a boy long time no see ise kun did you mistake me fo r a boy it cant be helped since i was a troublemaker just like the boys but it seems like we both have changed
in the time we didnt see each other really you cant tell what can happen in a reunion her words sounded like she meant something yes s he had realised my identity part 5 im glad that both of you are safe asia and i were hugged by buchou irina and the other girl had left my house after talking for 30 minutes she had come to japan after a long time she apparently came here because its the town she lived in as a child she said that she went to england because of her parents work but no matter how i think about it her parents are related to the church asia and i tried not to get too involved with them and left the talking to my mum especially since asia didnt want to get in contact with people related to the church i forced her to do something and made her wait in her room i was prepared to fight if anything were to happen but im glad nothing happened after that buchou returned home like us she came home with a pale face after she confirmed mine and asias safety she suddenly hugged us are
you injured i think they knew about us being devils but i think they couldnt lay a hand on us in a normal residence and especi ally in front of your mum who is a normal human both ise san and i are safe buchou san buchou hugged me and asia even tighter and held us like valuable things aaah ise im glad if something were to happen to you and asia i after the normal c lub activity i was called in by souna and was listening to the story about people related to the church intruding the town and i also heard that they have a holy sword with them buchou came home late because she had a talk with kaichou when she got close to my house she realised the abnormal presence and came rushing here buchou confessed that she thought of the worst when she entered the house and felt the presence of a strong holy power it seemed like her heart was beating fast44 high school dxd volume 3 i thought that the worst might have happened to my cute servants i prepared for the worst scenario you know if i were to bid farewell
to you after we had an argument then i would have regretted it till death im sorry i should have treated you two with more importanc e the gremory and their servants are beings with extra ordinary affection among the devils i remembered what ddraig had told me last night i think its the truth as well buchou gave a sigh of relief and shed a tear after confirming our safety she must have been extremely worried about us it was after she had a little rumble with asia and after she had got mad at me both of us thought that we made buchou mad buchou seemed like she was worried about it buchou san im also sorry for talking back to you i thought that buchou san would take ise san away from me i thought that i couldnt win asia apologised buchou smiled and patted asias head its okay buchou then hugged us with love aaah i can feel buchous love mamaybe she would let me do even naughty requests buchou oppai yes i know ise you really are a spoiled child no asia separated me from buchou nggggh it was a good chance buchou made a
sigh and continued talking after the three of us had calmed down according to souna who had met those two at noon they want to negotiate with me the devil rias gremory who has this town as her territory the people from the church want to negotiate with a devil buchou nodded at my question this was shocking the devils and christians are enemies and the negotiation came from them huh then is it a pact or a request im not sure what they are planning but they are planning to come to the club room after school tomorrow they apparently promised god that they wont attack us can you believe them we have to we have to believe in their belief since they are the believers of god and they are coming to request something from devils when we are supposed to be evil beings to them they seem to be under pressure and its certain that its trouble i have a bad feeling about this from their story the priests that come to this town keep getting killed buchous eyes became sharp and she had a serious face it certainly was scary even that shit priest freed who
sided with the fallen angel detests us if its a true believer of god then the way they look at us is even worse something was going to happen even i who was new to this world could feel that part 6 the next day after school we the members of gre mory group were gathered in the club room on the sofa buchou with akeno san and the two guests were sitting the other members of our group including myself were sitting in the corner of the room listening to their conversation ever since those two c ame to the club room we couldnt stop but feel something our instincts as devils were telling us that they were dangerous buchou and akeno san were talking to them with a serious face but the most dangerous one was kiba he was glaring at them grudgingly if something were to happen no he looked as if he was about to go slashing at them any moment they were the believers of god that kiba hates if you knew his past then45 high school dxd volume 3 you would know that he was brimming with hatred now under this atmosphere the first
one to talk was shidou irina recently the holy swords excaliburs that were kept by the catholic church headquarter vatican protestant church and eastern orthodox church were stolen excalibur was stolen and catholic and protestant if i rem ember correctly i was told in a lecture at school that there were different factions within the christian religion but how can excalibur be stolen from catholic protestant and eastern orthodox its in one location isnt it excalibur itself doesnt ex ist the one who answered my doubt was buchou arara looks like buchou can read what i am thinking im sorry one of my servants recently became a devil so can we continue this conversation while explaining about excalibur shidou irina nodded at buc hous request isekun excalibur broke in the war a long time ago irina looked at me and said that huh broke the holy sword did even if its a super famous sword now it looks like this the woman with blue hair and green mesh got her weapon whi ch was covered in cloth and revealed it to me what appeared was a long sword this is excalibur chills the moment i looked at it i felt
as if every pore on my body opened and felt something really cold running through my body fear shiver awe i became really scared from a single sword this is dangerous it is seriously dangerous even i understood that a devil would die instantly just from its touch is this a holy sword is this the ultimate weapon to kill devils excalibur was broken into pi eces during the war a long time ago the fragments were collected and turned into a new form by alchemy it was made into 7 swords this is one of them then this excalibur wasnt a real one but a new one that was made afterwards the excalibur i hold i s excalibur destruction its one of the 7 holy swords that were created the catholic church is in control of it the woman with a mesh put her sword away and wrapped it with a cloth if i look carefully there were spell symbols on the cloth does she have it sealed usually but it doesnt change the fact that its dangerous irina also took out something that looked like a long rope that rope started to move as if it were alive
the rope changed its shape right in front of me and turned into a katana mine is excalibur mimic i can change its shape into anything i want so its really useful for carrying around just like this each excalibur has its unique ability this one is in the possession of the protestant church she said it with pr ide i could feel fear due to that excalibur as well that was also really dangerous to us devils irina theres no reason to tell these devils the ability of excalibur is there ara xenovia even if they are devils we still have to form a trustworthy relationship with them in this situation also even if my swords ability is revealed i wont fall behind all the devils here shidou irina said confidently she probably had the confidence that she absolutely would not lose to us but for two of the legendary holy swords to be here wow isnt this a serious situation then i realised the presence coming from near me46 high school dxd volume 3 it was kiba he was glaring at the excaliburs and the two women with a scary face that i had never seen before thats
right kiba hol ds a grudge against excalibur i hadnt even dreamed that i would witness an excalibur in a place like this kiba probably never thought that he would encounter the excaliburs here and now it was right here in front of him he must have been going crazy calm down dont go jumping at them kiba buchou is talking professionally with the enemy if you jump in now then it would all be in vain the worst case would be the start of a battle theres no way that there would be no casualties against the excaliburs so what does the stolen excaliburs have to do with this country located in the east of the world buchou continued to talk with the same attitude as expected from our onee sama she isnt backing down even if its an excalibur in front of her she is holding her ground the girl with blue hair and a green mesh with scary eyes i think her name was xenoviacontinued to talk the catholic church was in possession of two excaliburs including mine the protestant church also had two also in the eastern orthodox church there were two as well the last
one went missing in the previous war between god devils and fallen angels one excalibur was stolen from each church the ones that stole them escaped to japan and brought them to this town hey hey so the holy swords thief has taken a liking to this town huh buchou also put her hand on her forehead and took a breath looks like my territory is full of incidents so who are the ones that stole the excaliburs the ones that stole them were the gri gori buchou widened her eyes in surprise at the answer the holy swords were taken by the fallen angel organisation its not a matter of mistake but certainly it would be the fallen angels when it comes to stealing them for the devils working at the top holy swords does not give them much interest we know the main culprit who stole the excaliburs one of the leaders of grigori kokabiel kokabiel one of the leaders of the fallen angels that survived the previous wars since ancient times i nev er expected to hear the name of the one that appears in the bible buchou also smirked at the name wait the leader of
the fallen angels not only do we have the excalibur but also the leader of the fallen angels ththen what was the reason they came here for was it for cooperation we sent priests exorcists to this town secretly but they kept getting killed xenovia said that are you serious there were violent incidents like that occurring and we didnt know about it then is it a request f or cooperation did they come to ask for the help of the high class devil who is in charge of this territory but what the two women said clearly betrayed my guesses our request no our order is to not to have any devils intrude in the battle between us and the fallen angels for the excaliburs in other words we came here to tell you not to interfere with this incident buchous eyes changed after hearing the way xenovia talked such manner of speech is it restraint are you thinking that we might collaborate with those fallen angels perhaps that we might team up with them to do something with excalibur the headquarters think that it might not be impossible there were chills within buchous eyes she was quite pissed
an enemy comes all the way to her territory then tells her not to be involved and not to butt in also they said whatever they wanted to by saying that they would not forgive us if we formed an alliance with the fallen angels buchous pride as a high class devil wouldnt allow her to keep quiet about it the higher ups dont trust devils and fallen angels we were ordered as if the holy swords are taken away from gods side then the devils would also be happy right the fallen angels would also profit from it for those reasons i t wont be weird for them to form an alliance thats why we are giving you a47 high school dxd volume 3 warning if you form an alliance with the fallen angel kokabiel then we will eliminate you all even if youre the little sister of the maou by our boss xenovia said it casual ly without caring about buchous glare if you know that i am the sister of a maou then it means that you have lots of connections with the higher ups in the church then i will say it we will not form
an alliance with the fallen angels never in the name of the gremory house i will not do something that would tarnish the name of our maou it had become a contentious situation for both sides but xenovia laughed fu hearing that is good enough i had to warn you just in case that kokabiel is hiding himself in this town along with the three excaliburs if something were to happen i would be the one to be hated by the bunch in the church headquarters well we wont ask for cooperation if you were to form an alliance with gods side temporally then it would affect the balance of the three factions especially if its the little sister of a maou after hearing xenovia buchou softened her expression and took a breath ngggggh they had been talking about complicated stuff that i couldnt follow where is the person the orthodox church dispatched xenovia answered buchous question they have that person put on hold for this case they are planning to protect the last excalibur if irina and i fail so its just the two of you you are going to retrieve the excaliburs from the leader of the fallen
angel with just the two of you how reckless are you trying to die buchou said it with an amazed voice but shidou irina and xenovia said it with straight eyes yes i have the same view as iri na but if its possible i dont want to die you came here to japan prepared to die the belief in your teaching is extreme like always dont talk ill of our beliefs rias gremory right xenovia right also the church decided that it would be b etter to eliminate all of the excaliburs rather than letting them get used by the fallen angels our minimum objective is to get the excaliburs away from the fallen angels to accomplish that its okay for us to die the only way to fight against the excaliburs are excaliburs what determination was this their beliefs pretty amazing something that i didnt understand at all these guys wanted to die for god that badly is it possible with only the two of you well we wont die in vain xenovia sai d fearlessly to buchous question you seem confident do you have a secret weapon maybe i will leave it to your imagination after that
the two of them just stared at each other and the conversation stopped shidou irina and xenovia l ooked at each other and stood up then we will take our leave now lets go irina so you wont drink your tea i can prepare a snack for you48 high school dxd volume 3 i dont need it xenovia declined buchous offer with her hand im sorry see you shidou irina also apologised with her hand they didnt try to accept buchous offer and the two of them tried to leave then both of them looked in the same direction it was asia when i saw you in hyoudou isseis house i thought that maybe it was you are you the witch asia argento i never expected to meet you in a place like this xenovia said asias body shook after she was called witch that word is something painful to asia irina seemed like she noticed as well and stared at asia are you the rumored witch the former holy maiden you are said to have the power that can also heal devils and fallen angels right i heard that you were sent somewhere after getting exiled but i never
thought you became a devil ummmmmi i asia didnt know how to react to irina and xenovia its okay i wont tell the higher ups what i saw here so rest assured people who were around the holy maiden asia will also get shocked as well asia made a perplexed expression at irinas words but to become a devil the one who was called a holy maiden you fell to the lowest place you could do you still believe in our god xenovia theres no way that she who became a devil still believes in god shidou irina said it with an amazed face no i can smell the belief from her it might be an abstract way of saying it but im sensitive to these things there are people who betray the teachings and still have guilt within them because they couldnt forget the teachings i can feel something similar coming from her xenovia said it with sharp eyes and irina stared at asia even more with interested eyes is that true asia san you still believe in god even if you have turned into a devil asia replied to that question with a sad expression i just cant
pu t it aside i believed in it for my whole life hearing that xenovia took her sword out from the cloth and pointed it at asia is that so then you should be cut down by us this instant if its now i can cut you in the name of god even if you have s inned our god will forgive you i couldnt stop something within me from burning xenovia approached asia i stood in front of asia to protect her dont touch her i said it clearly to xenovia if you come close to asia i wont forgive you you ca lled asia a witch didnt you yes i have right now she is a being at least fit to be called a witch ththis bitch i bit my tooth really hard and made a noise with my teeth because of the anger i had towards her49 high school dxd volume 3 dont fuck around not even a si ngle person helped her when she needed help those who cant understand asias kindness are a bunch of idiots its also wrong that none of them tried to become her friend do you think the holy maiden needed
friends whats important is the charity to others the holy maidens are finished when they seek friendship and love from others she could have continued to live with the love from god so asia argento didnt have the right to be a holy maiden from the beginning xenovia said it as if it was an obvious thing shit what the heck is with these guys i couldnt understand them i didnt want to understand them either how could they say that asia was the bad one so you guys selfishly made her into a holy maiden and abandon her because shes different from those who seek her thats fucked up it fuckin is i couldnt stop myself from saying what i held within me i always i always wanted to say this to those who are related to god none of you know what she went through what god what love that god didnt do jack shit when asia was in a dangerous situation but xenovia answered calmly god loved her if nothing happened then it means that she didnt believe in him enough or her belief was fake are the people in the church al l like this was
asia living among these guys dont screw around dont screw around what are you to asia family friend comrade thats why i will help asia i will protect asia if you try to lay a hand on her i will turn all of you into my enem ies xenovia sharpened her eyes at my provocation is that a declaration to usall of those in the church something big coming out from a single devil gremory i think you didnt educate him enough ise sto buchou tried to calm me but kiba stood in front of me thats good timing i will be your opponent kiba was carrying his sword and there was an enormous aura of intent to kill coming out of his body who are you kiba smirked at xenovias question im your senpai though i apparently was a failure that instant a countless number of demonic swords appeared in the club room part 7 hmmmm so how did it turn out like this i was standing at the place where we were practicing for the ball tournament kiba was standing a bit away from me and shidou irina and xenovia were standing in front of us enveloping us
and our surroundings was a barrier made from red aura the other members were looking at us from outside the barrier then lets start irina and xenovia took their white robe off and were wearing black battle purpose clothes they werent showing their skins but it lookederotic you could see the curves of their bodies ummmm both50 high school dxd volume 3 of them have nice curves and tight hips xenovia took the cloth off her weapon and revealed her excalibur the excalibur that shidou irina had also turned into the shape of a katana i will explain how it turned out like this while i was arguing with the two holy sword wielders kiba came in and it got worse buchou also seemed troubled about keeping the situation under control because it was us her servants who had started the fight then xenovia made a suggestion it might be interesting to test the strength of rias gremorys servants also im interested in the strength of the so called senpai xenovia accepted kibas challenge she also added that this battle wouldnt be reported to the church apparently they understood our position a little bit so they made it so that
it wouldnt be a problem if it was not a fight for life the location was t he place we practiced for the ball tournament near the old school building to avoid unnecessary damage and getting noticed by others akeno san put up a barrier for us with this we could fight a bit more recklessly and i was also participating in the battle why is this the battle for the extra time after the quarrel thats absurd i was certainly pissed because they were talking shit about asia but i never thought that it would turn into a battle like this i was actually going to stop when buchou came in to stop me it turned out like this because kiba came into the argument even if its just a match be cautious of the holy swords buchous warning reached me yyes i replied to her but i was trembling because i remembered the video the threat of the holy swords collection that we watched before the battle it seemed like a record of battles between a person wielding a holy sword and a high class devil the devil that was cut by the holy sword had smoke coming
out of the wounds made by t he holy sword and did you know that the part where it was cut vanished just like the word means it actually vanished a devil would be eliminated if they were cut by a holy sword their body will vanish scary its really scary i really dont want to be cut by it kiba on the other hand had activated his sacred gear and there were several demonic swords around him are you laughing kiba was laughing so much that it looked weird a smile that made the atmosphere cold there wasnt any trace of the refreshing smile he usually has that much do you hate the excalibur that much yeah the thing i wanted to defeat and destroy appeared right in front of me im happy fufufu i had even heard that by being close to a devil and a dragon powers would gather but for me to encounter it this early ddraig had said something similar as well lots of things will gather being attracted to the power of a dragon so this happened because of meand ddraig no it cant be sword birth huh the po ssessor can create any
demonic sword they imagine in their head its unique among the demonic sword related sacred gears i heard that there was a subject that avoided from being disposed by the holy sword project is that you kiba didnt answer xenovias question he just directed his killing intent towards her hey hey killing is prohibited you know kiba i beg you to make sure that it remains as a match if it gets beyond that wouldnt it affect the relationship between devils and god ma ou sirzechs sama will also be troubled hyoudou issei kun the one standing in front of me was shidou irina the girl with chestnut coloured hair i thought she was a guy when i was little but no matter how much i looked at her now she is a girl i barely remember the time when i played with her more like shes a bishoujo she has a nice body so shes my type when i met the boy that i havent seen for so long and he turned into a devil i was shocked51 high school dxd volume 3 she seemed really depressed well even i nev er thought that i would turn into a
devil but im enjoying my life ummmm shidou irina can i call you irina do we have to fight i already said what i wanted to regarding what you said about asia i dont think we have to battle it was my opinion t here were things i wanted to say to the people from the church regarding asia there was a part of me that felt relieved saying it today well if they said anything bad about asia again then i would fight them i dont take other people talking ill about my family but irina looked at me with a pitiful face more like there was a single drop of tear falling down her cheek a pitiful hyoudou issei kun no i will call you ise kun since i knew you since a long time ago and what trick has destiny played on us i went to england because i found out that i can use holy swords and i thought that i could be a representative of god aaah this also must be a trial that god has given me the land that i havent been back in for so long a harsh destiny where my c
hildhood friend has turned into a devil the way time moves is harsh but by moving forward i will turn into someone with the true belief towards god now ise kun i will give judgment to you with this excalibur amen even though irina was shedding tear s she seemed really eager to do it and pointed her sword at me huh huuuuh th this girl kept on saying something hard to understand oooh her eyes were sparkling like a star did she get drunk with her beliefs was she enjoying this situation wow t his is a type of girl you should never get involved with i dont actually know what you are on about but activate boosted gear boost it made a red glow and a gauntlet appeared on my left arm it also made a sound at the same time and increased my power my sacred gear has the ability to double my power every 10 seconds its also possible to transfer the boosted power to someone or something i just have to activate my sacred gear beforehand if she did something before that then i couldnt have d one a thing irina and xenovia seemed shocked
after seeing my sacred gear longinus is that a boosted gear i never thought that i would meet the person possessed by the welsh dragon in a far eastern country like this both of them raised their e yebrows you will hurt yourself if your attention is on ise kun clash kiba went on slashing towards xenovia the holy sword and demonic sword made sparks xenovia smirked after blocking kibas strike sacred gear sword rebirth and boosted gear an d also the twilight healing that asia argento has all of them are sacred gear that are said to be a heresy to us maybe it was natural for you to turn into a devil my power is also the power made by my comrades hatred who were killed while filled with regret i will beat those with excalibur with this power and i will destroy that excalibur so kiba also vowed the revenge of the test subjects that were killed by that project here i come ise kun irina rushed in slashing towards me dangerous she came slashing at me seriously if i get cut by that a devil like me would receive a critical damage wouldnt it a direct
hit is bad seriously bad im not done yet i was increasing my power while evading her katana boost52 high school dxd volume 3 the power went thr ough my body now my power was doubled again but it seemed like i was still lacking power to fight her how much should i boost shit i dont have much experience and its my first time fighting against a holy sword i will just keep on evading and attack after ive boosted my power as much as i can if it turns out like this then i have to use it if i dont i cant calm myself no if i dont it will be a waste of this battle i will use dress break if i see a chance one of my ultimate techniques a power to blow away clothes girls limited by using the magical power that i increased irina made a suspicious face what a lecherous face what are you thinking fufufu i will be seeing you naked soon please be careful ise senpai has the power to blow away the clothes of women he touches koneko chan why are you revealing my move to the enemy koneko
chan said it while looking at me with rebellious eyes enemy of all women you are the worst aaah those are harsh words koneko chan what a lowly technique aaah god please forgive this sinful pervert irina made a sad expression while praying dont look at me with those pitiful eyes you are the worst im sorry koneko chan sorry for being horny isesan if you were cravin g for a womans body then you could have said it to me i wouldnt mind sacrificing my body for ise san self sacrifice just to be expected from a former christian asia san but arent you saying something bold out of the blue i see the mass of sexual desire i think its a fitting action for a devil that has such strong greed xenovia said it while making a sigh but she was looking at me with scornful eyes im sorry i dont know why but kiba apologised to her theres no need for you to apol ogise you dipshit why am i the only one being treated like this kiba created a demonic sword where he stood and held it he now had two swords and went towards xenovia
now back to where we were burn and freeze flare brand and freeze mist one of the demonic swords created a whirl of flames while the other one made a cold air and silver frost kiba is a knight knights traits are their speed he was attacking with god speed but xenovia was evading kibas attack which came from all direction s with the minimum movements the knights swift move and flame and ice demonic swords but you are too nave kaching a single swing of xenovias turned kibas two demonic swords to dust kiba became speechless because his demonic swords were destroyed with a single swing what destructive power so thats the holy sword my sword is a mass of destruction theres nothing it cant destroy xenovia swirled around her sword she then pointed it upwards then thrust it into the ground doooooooo oooooooon53 high school dxd volume 3 suddenly the place where i was standing shook and the ground was rumbling i lost my balance and kneeled on the ground i couldnt stand there were clouds of dust in the surroundings there was even dirt flying towards me and it went onto my face spit spit i wiped
the dirt off my face while spitting out the dirt inside my mouth i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the practice grounds a crater there was a big hole at the place where xenovia had placed her sword dont tell me that it made a crater with one hit just with one slash of the sword when xenovia stabbed the ground with her sword it didnt seem like she had used too much power this is my excalibur it can destroy anything that comes its way its not called excalibur for nothing excalibur destruction so the destructive power was on a different level even if it wasnt kibas demonic sword it would get shattered kiba made a bitter expression when he saw that such a destructive power when it isnt a real excalibur so destroying all 7 swords will be a difficult path his eyes hadnt lost the colour of hatred yet kiba was trying to break all 7 of them a single sword is that strong you know i think breaking it would be hard even for kiba seriously i was getting sick of this world because there are so many people stronger than us boost the
third boost geez im all covered in dirt because you destroyed the ground xenovia irina wiped the dirt off her clothes while complaining but its about t ime to settle this now she pointed her sword at me and dashed towards me fast she closed our distance instantly even if she wasnt as fast as kiba she was definitely faster than me what should i do should i stop my boost here and start attacking ev en if she doesnt have the intent to kill me i will just keep on losing my stamina just by evading her attacks i at least have the power to react to my opponents movement but im still not sure if its enough to defeat her i cant activate my sacred g ear for the second time because she wont give me any time for it i should be vigilant of that excalibur and attack her who is a normal human even if her weapon is deadly she herself isnt it might be a bad way of thinking but i have to bet on this you are doing well you are good at dodging seems like your master trained you well yeah my master
is strict with my training thats why i can even keep up with those stronger than me just like this boost lets go boosted gear explosion i stopped my boost and made it so that i could fight with the power i had increased till now if i dont stop like this then the power will get unbalanced and the power might start from zero heartbeat there was power surging throughout my body it was my fourth boost but i could probably take her on with this if that was the case then i would blow her clothes away yeah i dont care if its a lowly technique i havent gone through the training of hell and battles against phoenix for nothing i mean i am definitely going to strip her down i think that i definitely need to use dress break i went towards irina while having enough magic power to strip her clothes sorry for stripping you obscene54 high school dxd volume 3 irina avoided my tackle as if she just protected herself from a molester chi shes fast but im not giving up i dont care even if i am a pervert im going to live strong
its not over yet i started to keep up with irinas movement right no left i could somehow see where she would escape to because of my desire of wanting to use my technique isekun is moving much better than usual for the lecherous power inside him to increase his stats this much akeno san and koneko chans comments they both became amazed at my power of lecher and were also shocked im sorry for being a lecher but no one can stop me once i get turned on to strip the girls and finally i moved to the part where irina escaped to what you caught up with me irina looked surprised fufufu dont look down on my power of lecher i caught you now im going to strip you down now im going to have a look at your oppai i shortened the distance while moving all my fingers and by putting on a lecherous face i jumped towards her as if i were diving itadakimasu but before i reached irina she ducked down wh what i couldnt stop my body and i went passed irina and went through the barrier heading towards where asia and koneko chan
were56 high school dxd volume 3 here touch my hand touched both of their shoulders then strip asia and koneko chans uniform blew off yes even their underwear they both became fully naked dress break was a success asias breasts that were still growing and koneko chans loli breasts became fully exposed in front of me drip there was blood coming out of my nose thank you very much no thats not what i mean this is no asia hid her body because she became too embarrassed im sorry asia but you have nice proportions like always onii chan is looking forwar d to it because your oppai looks like its still growing koneko chan on the other hand she still looked emotionless but her body started to shake and then she thrust her fist oh crap kokoneko chan you have it wrong this is a mistake well it did work but i still think that even small oppai are important huh what am i saying thats not it its because shidou irina dodged it i wasnt aiming for you and asia b but thank you very much i will just thank you just in case you super lecher bang
gufuuuu i received a heavy blow to my stomach and my body felt weird uwaaaaa my body was flying when i violently landed on the ground i continued to roll on the ground cough its a critical damage im so hurt that i cant get up poke poke irina poked me isekun are you still alive i think that it was divine punishment for creating such a move with this you should have learned that you have to seal lecherous techniques like that okay noits the technique i created by putting al l of my talents at magic into it im going to continue blowing away girls clothes i seriously had a hard time choosing between this move and a move that lets me see through girls clothes i made a stance against irina while slowly getting up im going to continue fighting until i blow away girls clothes just by looking at them i raised my spirit and went towards her to be able to fight just for those motives something is definitely wrong with you shidou irina sexual desires are a source of power its justice amen god lend me the strength to cut down this lecherous devil
irina held the grip of her holy sword and came rushing towards me i lowered myself so i could kick irina to make her fall from below as she was slashing towards m e irina noticed it and did a small jump i kicked the ground so i could get up fast heres my uppercut swing my uppercut missed irinas chin irina made sharp eyes she swung her katana to the side but i avoided it by jumping backwards irina looked at me with a shocked face im sorry looks like i was taking you a bit lightly you have good movements57 high school dxd volume 3 irina made a serious face oh can i win this thats what i thought but i fell down onto the ground what the i felt power leaving out of m y body i can still move while enduring certain pains but this was different i seriously have no strength left shitwhats happening when i looked at my stomach there was smoke emitting from it is this the damage caused by the holy sword when on earth did i get cut from the attack just now it just grazed me and i turn out
like this its the damage caused by the holy sword devils and fallen angels get their power and existence erased by receiving damage from the holy sword to their body if it were a bit deeper then it would have been critical it was just a graze does it take that much power from me that i get down on my knees reset the time for the boosted gear activation was finished i also lost the boosted power within my body my power returned to normal how could this be if you had another boost then you could have definitely evaded that attack we could have had a proper match you lost because you used your sacred gear while not knowing the power difference between yourse lf and your opponent a simple mistake can become critical in a serious fight damn it it was no use my body couldnt move at all i lost did i make a fool of myself in front of buchou and asia miserable haaaaaaaaaa kiba raised his spirit up and tried to make something in his hand it turned into the shape of a sword but the destructive power of that holy sword or the
destructive power of my demonic sword we will see which one is stronger what appeared in kibas hand was a gigantic sword kiba held it with both hands while releasing an ominous aura its big its way longer than kibas height it definitely was more than two meters kiba then swung it with force the slash reached xenovia but she made a sigh as if she was really disappointed its a shame you made the wrong decision gachin a violent sound of metal a large fragment of the sword went up in the air it was kibas sword that broke xenovias excalibur easily destroyed kibas demonic sword your weapon is the variety of the sword you can create and your speed you would need a lot of strength to swing a gigantic sword like that and you will lose the speed that you are proud of are you seeking a destructive power from your fighting style its something unnecessary d ont you even know that bang the pommel of the holy sword hit deep into kibas stomach it was a simple move like that yet it created a shockwave it meant that even a single attack with a pommel has
destructive power gaha kiba fell onto the ground after he vomited from his mouth even if its not a hit with the blade that hit just now will be enough to stop you from standing for a while xenovia glared at kiba once and turned around wa wait kiba reached his hands towards her but everyone here knew that the match was over akeno san unsealed the barrier the red aura that covered the area disappeared the battle was over58 high school dxd volume 3 senpai i suggest you fight with coolness the next time we fight rias gremory i trust you with the talk from earlier also you should train your servants a bit more theres a limit for polishing their battling style kiba glared at xenovia with hatred xenovia then looked at me i will tell you one thing vanishing dragon has already awakened what did she just say you will meet him eventually but in your current state you can never win xenovia just said that and left after picking her stuff wait for me xenovia then its like that ise kun tell me whenever you want to get judged amen shidou irina held her cross and
winked at me she then left the scene buchou closed her eyes im sure that she didnt feel good kiba and i were ultimately defeated part 8 are you okay asia put her hand on my stomach and healed my wound with her sacred gear asia was wearing the spare uniform she had in the old school building she was wearing it because i blew her clothes away earlier the warm green coloured light that was made from her hand surrounded me and healed my wound i showed you an uncool side of me asia i said it to asia while laughing but asia shook her head im glad that your wound was minimal after getting hit by a holy sword i was really scared thinking ise san might have vanished aaah did i make asia worry again im making this girl worry a lot im sorry for blowing your clothes off i apologised sincerely no matter how you think about it it was my fault but asia just smiled at me there was a plan that you were thinking about right ise san i am fine with anything ise san does for me sob my eyes got warm asia
you believe in me that much but you know asia i wasnt thinking about anything except blowing girls clothes away aaaah asias smile is too bright you might have won if you did another boost with the sacred gear koneko chan said it while massaging my shoulders it hurts it hurts koneko chan koneko chan was also wearing a spare uniform just like asia but it was the first time koneko chan said something like that to me i was a bit moved not knowing it means you lack practice and real battle experience aaau you sure hit the spot im sorry for being a lecher hold on yuuto i heard buchous voice when i looked there was kiba who seemed like he was trying to leave and an angry buchou what the is kiba going somewhere i wont forgive you if you leave me you are the knight of the gremory group i will also be troubled if you turn into an exiled wait this instant i was able to run away from there thanks to my comrades thats why i have to put their regrets into my demonic swords after saying that kiba disappeared59 high school dxd volume
3 yuutowhy i couldnt look at buchous sad face at the same time i made up my determination part 9 aaaaa and what was the reason for calling me the next day off i called kaichous pawn saji in front of the train station saji seemed listless i somehow managed to get in contact with saji thanks to buchou hes right what were you two trying to do the one who was holding onto my shirt and wasnt letting go was koneko chan i met her by coincidence when i was on my way to meet saji in front of the train station i tried to run away but i was caught easily im inferior in terms of physical build against a loli shoujo like always well it couldnt be hel ped she didnt seem to like the fact that i tried to run away after i saw her face so she was not leaving in terms of observation i think shes holding a grudge against me because i stripped her naked a few days ago the reason why i called saji that i s i coughed once and told both of them im going to ask shidou irina and
xenovia to give me permission to destroy the holy sword excaliburs not only saji but koneko chan also became really shocked that they had circle eyes60 high school dxd volume 3 life3 the plan to destroy the holy sword part 1 nooooooooo im going home saji was screaming and trying to run away koneko chan held onto him and didnt let him go when i suggested the plan to destroy excalibur koneko chan thought about it and agreed i will help as well its about yuuto senpai right as expected of koneko chan saji on the other hand turned blue and tried to run away immediately and koneko chan caught him hyoudou why me its your groups problem right i belong to the house of sitri i shouldnt take part in this not at all saji argued while crying dont say that saji the only devil that i know who seems willing to help me is you bullshit theres no way that i will help youuuu im going to get killed im going to get killed by kaichouuuuu oooh the fear you have towards kaichou is appearing on your face kaichou must be really scary huh your master rias senpai
might be strict and kind but you know what you know kaichou shes strict and strict yeah buch ou is strict but also kind is that right so kaichou is strict huh thats good for you after i made up my mind i went looking for shidou irina and xenovia inside the town with koneko chan and saji hey koneko chan you know that kiba is a victim of t he holy sword project and also harbours a grudge towards excalibur right koneko chan nodded at my question when irina and xenovia came to us they said this the church decided that it would be better to eliminate all the excaliburs rather than letting them be used by the fallen angels our minimum objective is to get the excaliburs away from the fallen angels so in other words they have to destroy the stolen excaliburs or retrieve them right yes thats right thats why i thought we could help them retrieve those by making kiba the main person three swords were stolen so they wont mind if we retrieve or break one of them you want yuuto senpai to overcome excalibur and to fulfill his wish right thats right i
nodded my head with a smile if that happened then kiba would accomplish his revenge and everything would be okay then he would continue doing the devils job with us with a smile thats what i thought kiba wants to win against excalibur and accomplish his and his f ormer comrades revenge xenovia and irina want to retrieve the excaliburs from the fallen angels even if they have to destroy them we have the same aim then whats left is to see if those two will listen to the words of us devils it seems hard hmmmm yeah it was just like koneko chan said to tell you the truth the possibility of it happening wasnt that high and also61 high school dxd volume 3 its a secret from buchou and the other members yeah it was just like she said we couldnt let this to be known by b uchou and akeno san buchou would definitely disapprove even if its for yuutos sake we cant put our neck in the problems involving angels thats what she would say she is a high class devil after all so she would be strict about this stuff when i went to rescue
asia she was against it i also had to keep it a secret from asia shes the type who cant hide things shed be bad at lying as well when we go and talk to them it might lead to a fight and the tension between us and them might get even worse it would be the end if that happened i would have to do something even if i had to risk my life uoooo i might die then thats why you can leave koneko chan saji you can also run away if it gets dangerous let me run nowwww thats the worst id get killed by kaichou if i do something like destroying the excaliburs without her permission she will definitely torture meeeeee now now dont cry and stick with me you can run away if it gets dangerous maybe the negotiation will be a success if that happens then i want you to help me uwaaaaaa thats so irresponsible ill die id definitely get killed you are right but there arent any other male devils that i can talk to im depending on you saji i wont run away it s for our comrade koneko chan said
it to me with eyes filled with strength this girl no matter what she says shes always burning inside she was also in high spirits in the match against phoenix i think her feelings towards comrades are very strong twenty minutes after looking for them in the town it wouldnt be easy to find two women wearing white robes in an undercover mission please give blessings to the lost lamb please give charity to us on behalf of the father in heaven we found them easily there were two girls wearing white robes praying on the road wow they were standing out it was easy to find them it looked like they were quite troubled people walking past them were giving them odd glances how can this be this is the r eality of the developed country of japan thats why i dont like countries that dont have the smell of our beliefs dont say that xenovia we lost all the money we had so we have to rely on charity from these heretics or else we cant get food you know aaah we cant even buy a single loaf of bread hmph it all happened because you bought that
fake looking painting xenovia pointed at a painting of a saint that was drawn really badly what the heck was that did they get cheated in a fake exhibition what are you saying this painting has the drawing of someone who looks like a saint thats what the person in the exhibition said as well then do you know who the person in the drawing is i certainly dont the person in the picture certainl y looked like a foreigner and was wearing poor clothing and had something on his head there was also a baby angel on the background with a trumpet who was floating in the air i think itssaintpeter62 high school dxd volume 3 dont mess around saint peter wouldnt look like this no he must have looked like this im sure about it aaah why did my partner have to be someone like yougod is this also a trial hey dont hold your head down you really get depressed when you are down dont you shut up thats why the protestants are called heretics you guys have different beliefs than us catholics show more respect to the saints what whats wrong it is catholicism where they
still abide by the old law what did you say heretic what did you say heretic those two started to argue by banging their heads against each other rumble then we heard the sound of their stomachs rumble when we were a distance away from them the two of them dropped onto the ground with their stomachs rumbling first of all lets do something to fill our stomachs or else its not a matter of retrieving the excaliburs you are right do you want to get money from the heretics by threatening them i think god will forgive us if we threaten the heretics do you pl an to attack the shrine or do you plan to steal their offertory box dont do either lets use our swords to put on a performance its an international entertainment that works in every country thats an excellent idea if we can cut fruits with our excaliburs then we can gather cash well we dont have fruits it cant be helped lets cut that picture no you cant cut this down the two of them started arguing again i went towards both of them even though i was getting a headache seriousl y
they didnt seem like the girls i had an argument with in the clubroom just a few days ago part 2 delicious japanese cuisine is delicious yes yes this is it this is the taste of the food of my homeland irina and xenovia started to fill their stomachs with the food they ordered at a family restaurant man they eat a lot are they really assassins sent from the christian church when they saw us earlier they looked at us with hungry eyes ummmwe are going to eat now so do you guys want to come as well when i asked them they said okay straight away we sold our souls to the devils this is also to accomplish our mission they were saying something like that while we were on our way here i was worried about my money but koneko chan said she would also pay its not manly if i make a girl pay especially since she is my junior thats what i wanted to say but after seeing these two eating i would be in deep shit if we didnt pay together th this is also for the club its for our gr oup damnnnn
you kibaaaa im going through all of this shit for you im definitely going to make kiba introduce me to one of his hot clients phew now im calm its the end of the world to get helped by a devil63 high school dxd volume 3 that was what xenovia said hey we are treating you to food and thats what you say i said it while holding down my emotions i couldnt talk to them with strong words otherwise we couldnt negotiate pheeeew thank you for the meal aaaah god please give charity to these devils irina said while using her cross auu at that moment i got a headache the same thing happened to koneko chan and saji so they were touching their head as well seems like us devils received some damage because she used her cross ah im sorry i did it wi thout thinking irina smiled with a cute face these two look like a bishoujo if you look at them normally xenovia drank a cup of water and took a deep breath she then asked so why did you come to us i never thought she would get right to it wel l it
didnt look like we met them by coincidence you two came to this country to retrieve the excaliburs right thats right we already told you that before both of them didnt seem like they were giving us hostile intent because they had just finished their food there was no point battling us in this family restaurant and even if we did battle they were confident that they could beat us with ease i want to help you destroy the excaliburs both of them looked surprised at what i just said the y were also looking at each other gulp i swallowed my saliva and waited for their decision wow its scary scary if they reject us then we are in deep shit it might turn into a battle between angels fallen angels and devils to think about it the excaliburs are supposed to be quite an important thing and to destroy that together with devils like us might be an insult to them perhaps i was getting worried about things like that when xenovia opened her mouth yeah maybe its okay leaving one swo rd to you guys if you can destroy it that is but make sure that your
identities arent revealed we also dont want our high ups and enemies to think that we are connected to you guys i just opened my mouth because i didnt expect that she would giv e us permission like that is it alright are you serious for real hey xenovia are you sure even if its ise kun hes still a devil you know irina raised an objection well thats the normal response irina to tell you the truth it would really be tough to retrieve the three excaliburs and to battle kokabiel with only the two of us i know that but the minimum objectives we have to achieve are destroying the three excaliburs or take them back if our excaliburs are going to be stolen as well then we should break them before it happens even if we use the last resort theres only a 30 percent chance that we will succeed in our mission and return home safely even so we thought that the success rate was high enough to come to this country prepared to put our life on the line64 high school dxd volume 3 yeah the high ups also told us to continue with our
mission as well and dispatched us to this country its almost self sacrifice and isnt that what we the followers desire for i changed my mind my bel iefs are flexible so i can act in the best way you i have been thinking about it for a long time but your faith is a bit weird i wont deny it but i think that its our duty to accomplish our mission and return safely im going to live and conti nue fighting for god am i wrong you are not wrong but thats why we wont ask for help from the devils instead we ask for help from a dragon the high ups didnt tell us not to borrow the strength of a dragon xenovia then looked at me dragon she was talking about me the being that is residing in my left arm sekiryuutei i never thought that i would meet sekiryuutei in a distant country like this even if you turned into a devil i see that the dragon power within you is still present if its like the legend says then you can increase your power to that of a satan correct if you gain a
power to that of a satan then you can break the excaliburs without a sweat i also think that it was gods doing that we had this meeting xenovia said joyfully ccertainly they didnt tell us not to borrow the power of a dragon but you are just saying nonsense your belief is certainly weird weird is fine with me but irina hes your childhood friend right lets trust him the power of a dragon irina became silent at xenovias words but her expression showed that she was okay with it for now oh its okay then are you serious but for me to increase my power to that of a satan i have to increase my ability even further but if i tra nsfer my power that i boosted to the max to kiba he can be equal to or surpass excalibur im sure the possibility is really high okay the negotiation is a success i will lend you guys my dragons power then can i call my partner for this cooperation then i got my phone out and called kiba i understand the situation kiba put his mouth on the coffee after he made a sigh we called
kiba to the family restaurant im with those two excalibur wielders i want you to come here as well kiba when i said that he came here without any complaint to tell the truth i feel unsatisfied when the wielders of the excaliburs are giving me the permission to destroy it thats a rough way to speak if you were a stray devil i would have cut you down without any time to spare kiba and xenovia glared at each other hey hey lets not fight before the co operation strategy so you do hold a grudge regarding the holy sword project against the church and the excaliburs kiba sharpened his eyes at i rinas words obviously he replied with a low and cold voice65 high school dxd volume 3 but kiba kun thanks to that project the research on holy sword users showed results thats why it created people like xenovia and i who can synchronise with the holy swords do you think its a forgiving act to kill all the test subjects because the project was thought to be a failure kiba looked at irina with eyes filled with hatred certainly killing them is cruel its too cruel
i think that its an inhuman act for those who believe in god even irina didnt know how to respond then xenovia spoke that incident also became one of the worst cases among us and people felt disgusted about it the person in charge of that project at that time was said to have a problem with his belief so he was charged with heresy now hes one of those people on the fallen angels side on the fallen angels side whats the name of that person kiba took interest and asked xenovia valper galilei the man who is called the genocide archbis hop valper so thats the name of kibas enemy if i go after fallen angels then can i reach him kibas eye had the colour of a new determination just knowing his target was a big step for him then it looks like i have to share information as well the other day i was attacked by a person who had the excalibur at that time he killed a priest the one who was killed is probably from your organisation everyone became surprised obviously i never thought that kiba would have been involved before us so why
was he quiet about it the whole time im sure that he had something in his mind the name of that person is freed sellzen does this name sound familiar freed that shit priest i remember him very well hes the crazy priest from t he previous incident he was still in this town xenovia and irina both made sharp eyes at kibas words i see so its him freed sellzen former exorcist of the vatican the genius who became an exorcist at the age of 13 he had lots of big achieveme nts because he kept on eliminating devils and mystical beasts but he overdid it he even killed his allies freed never had any beliefs towards our god from the start the only thing he had was fighting instinct and killing intent towards monsters and an abnormal obsession for battles it was a matter of time that hed be charged for heresy aaah so you guys also have had problems with him i understand that feeling is that so freed used the excalibur he stole to kill our fellow followers for us t o pay the price because the disposal group couldnt take care of him that time
xenovia said it with hatred freed sure is hated by lots of people well obviously anyways lets move onto the cooperation strategy xenovia took out a pen and used it to write on a memo pad she gave us her contact details if something happens call this number thanks then we should also we already received ise kuns number from oba sama are you serious mum she gave it without my permission she told her sons number without my permission66 high school dxd volume 3 why dont you call him she probably gave her my number like that because we are childhood friends then thats it then ill repay you for the meal another time sekiryuutei hyoudou issei xenovia got up after saying that thanks for the meal ise kun treat me again next time as well even if you are a devil god will allow it if its ise kun who treats me to a meal its okay if its food irina thanked me while giving me a wink is it alright for your religious belief to be like that we sent the two of them off and we all gave out a deep breath fuuuu it somehow went
smoothly i thought it was a reckless plan but it was easier than i thought i felt chills when i thought that i might have gotten cut down by the excaliburs if id failed in the negotiation it could have been the trigger for the war between the devils and people from gods side that was quite a bold move for me ise kun why did you do this kiba asked me quietly he was certainly won dering why i was helping him out with his revenge well we are comrades and we belong to the same group and you helped me out before as well its not like im trying to repay you but i thought i would give you a hand this time if i act by myself then i would cause trouble for buchou thats also the reason right of course buchou would get sad if you were to go around in a rampage well the fact that i made this plan by myself will cause trouble to buchou as well but its better than you bec oming an exiled right well it turned out to be a success since we made an agreement with those guys
from the church kiba still didnt look satisfied ummm hes quite hard to deal with then koneko chan spoke yuuto senpai i would get lonelyif senpai disappeared koneko chan put on a sad face she is usually unemotional so the sudden change had a lot of impact on all the guys here i will help youthats why please dont go69 high school dxd volume 3 koneko chans appeal oh crap even if she wasnt saying it to me i felt my heartbeat go up aaah i definitely cant betray our group if a kohai junior says that to me i definitely cant rebel kiba seemed troubled but then put on a smiley face hahaha i give up if koneko chan says that to me then i cant do reckless things okay i will work with you thanks to ise kun i know who my true enemy is but since we are doing this we are definitely going to defeat the excalibur oh kiba was eager to do this as well now koneko chan smiled because she felt relieved crap you look so cute koneko chan i felt my heartbeat go up even though im not a lolicon okay now we
have formed the group to destroy the excalibur lets defeat the stolen excalibur and that shit freed i was all pumped okay we are going to go like this i think we can do it if its me kiba and koneko chan no we can do it wait for us excalibur freed but there was one guy who wasnt that eager to do it ummm do i have to do it as well saji asked us while he put his hand up i mean im totally uninvolved in this after all how are kiba and excalibur related oh yeah this guy didnt know about kiba and excalibur to saji he probably didnt understand what was going on in the earlier conversation lets talk a bit kiba then started to talk about his past after he drank the coffee the project that the catholic church planned secretly project holy sword the test to make lots of people who can use holy swords was taking place in a certain institute there were boys and girls who had talents at using swords and a possessor of sacred gear day after day they were going through inhuman experiments they were being experimented on and
had their rights of freedom taken away they werent treated as humans and their lives were ignored but they had a dream to live on they were forced to believe that they were loved by god and they were just waiting for that day to come they believed that they would become special beings they believed that they could become people who could wield holy swords but the result was disposal kiba and his comrades couldnt use the holy swords everyone died they were killed killed by those who serve god no one saved us just because we couldnt use the holy swords other boys and girls were put under poisonous gas while still alive they put poisonous gas on us while saying amen we vomited blood and suffered on the floor even so we were seeking help from god kiba told us his story w e listened to him silently kiba somehow managed to escape from the laboratory but the poisonous gas had already infected him apart from certain people the test subjects who had lower abilities than average were all disposed of because they werent need ed kiba who managed to escape met buchou who came to observe
italy as he was dying and now he was here i want to accomplish my comrades regrets no i dont want to make their deaths be in vain i need to keep on living in their place and i have to prove that i am stronger than excalibur what an intense past he had asia also had a sad past but kiba had been going through a life that was so hard to imagine to tell the truth i cantt understand the pain kiba went through but i think its hard to live on just for revenge buchou said that she made him her servant so he could use his talents on something besides defeating holy swords uuuuuuusob we were listening to kibas past with serious faces but we heard someone crying it was saji h e was crying aloud he had so much tears falling out of his eyes and was crying so much he also had a dripping nose saji took kibas hand and said70 high school dxd volume 3 kiba it must have been horrible it must have been painful damn it there isnt any god or hope in t his world right now i feel so
much sympathy for you yeah its a horrible story i understand why you hold a grudge against those people from the church and excalibur oooh look at how saji is talking to tell you the truth i didnt like you before because you were a good looking guybut its different now i will also help im willing to receive the punishment from kaichou but before that we have to destroy excalibur i will also work hard you also have to live on dont ever betray rias senpai w ho saved you what he was saying was weirdbut he was also like me he was full of passion more like he was a good guy yeah he wasnt a bad guy i felt bad dragging him into this but it seemed like it was alright after all okay its a good time i want you guys to hear my story you guys should know about me if we are working together saji seemed a bit shy then said it with glittering eyes my dream is tomake kaichou pregnant and marry her but you know making a girl pregnant and marrying her is hard for an unpopular guy like me there arent
any girls that i can make pregnant to begin with but i will one day make her pregnant and marry her after hearing sajis confession there was something inside me that was coming out then there were loads of tear drops flowing out of my eyes of course of course idiot this guy saji hes the same as me hes the same kind as me he has the same understanding of the world as me i almost cried out because i was moved but i put my hands on my mouth to stop it i took sajis hand and said it straight at him saji listen to me my aim is to grope buchous oppaiand then suck it drop after a pause more tear drops were flowing out of sajis eyes hyoudouuuu do you know what you are saying do you understand how hard that dream is to touch the high class devils oppai to touch the oppai of your master saji you can touch it you can touch the high class devils oppai you can touch your masters oppai i actually groped buchous oppai with this hand i said it while moving my hands saji looked at my hand
with a shocked face impossible something like that is possible you are not lying right its not a lie masters oppai is far away but its not like you cant reach it sucking it sucking ka kaichous oppai you are talking about the nipple right the place where you can suck is the nipple right dumb ass if you are going to suck oppai then the nipple is the only thing you can suck yes im going to suck the nipple saji started to cry like a man after hearing my strong words saji we may be useless pawns if we are just by ourselves but its different if its the two of us we can fly if its the two of us we can fight if its the two of us we c an do it if its the two of us we can make them pregnant and marry them if its the two of us lets have sex with our own masters yeah yes71 high school dxd volume 3 nothing is impossible if its two guys who fell in love with their masters oppai we took each others hand and nodded comrade war buddy even if i use
many words i cant explain the relationship between us at that time saji and i felt something with our spirits and we connected with each other ahaha you are the worst kiba and koneko chan who were next to us sighed if id looked around everyone in the restaurant would be looking at us with weird eyes well dont mind them like this the excalibur destroying squad was formed part 3 a few days later i was sitting at my desk in my classroom sighing heavily every day the four of us me kiba koneko chan and saji searched for the excalibur our opponent was that shit priest freed who worked under the fallen angels apparently he was hunting down priests sent by the church so we wandered ar ound the town dressed in priests outfits but still couldnt find him well my true feeling was that i didnt want to ever see him again we were wearing the priest outfit that xenovia gave us that kept our magical power down but still couldnt encounter him where was that shit priest hiding i wanted to find him so kiba could destroy the excalibur at this rate we would get caught
by buchou and get into deep shit she had started getting suspicious of us im sorry buchou for doing something like this without telling you i will apologise to you a lot afterwards i will work hard as well thats why please let us do this like that i was apologising to her within my heart you have a serious face lately ise motohama said to me while fixing the position of his glasses eh aaah yeah kinda even i have to think about certain things sometimes is it that were you thinking about groping rias senpais oppai or himejima senpais oppai i always have a hard time choosing that every day motohama by the way in terms of size buchou wins buchou also wins in terms of fullness but in terms of softness akeno san wins no buchou has more meat but akeno sans ones has good balance with the oppai and the areola so it reminds me of something like y amato nadeshiko in terms of having fun groping buchou wins but akeno sans oppai is also big if you keep on doing that you are going to get killed by senpais worshipers one day you know there
are many of them at this school motohama oppai is more important than life thats deep i felt a shock in my heart pinch there was someone pinching my cheek its asia chan she seemed like she was in a really bad mood ahia khan vhat ar yu duong asia was pinching my cheek without say ing a word but it did seem like asia because she wasnt pinching me hard she must have heard everything i just said damn it ise you ero daiou 5 you have violated the occult research club and not only that but you also receive that kind of treatment from asia chan nuooooooo matsuda was spitting out his anger at me while holding his head down72 high school dxd volume 3 we know ise apparently you link your arms with rias senpai and asia chan after your club activity dont you are you trying to go home while having two flowers in your arms you should get blown away to a different dimension and get melted by slimy monsters nono motohama its not as simple as you say thats because asia and buchou are competing with each other for some unknown reasons thats why
i feel awkward since i am in the middle of it more like there isnt any space to breath when im between them every time that happens i imagine bad things like can i actually become a harem king im a useless guy because i cant even control a single girl by the way ise what are you going to do about the plan for karaoke and bowling motohama asked me after he reverted to his usual se lf yes we were planning to play for half a day during the next weekend with the three of us asia and kiryuu we had also invited koneko chan and kiba asia and kiryuu were coming surprisingly koneko chan was eager to come as well i thought that she would decline for sure the problem was kiba i had talked to him but it was this situation asia and kiryuu are going so is koneko chan uooooooooo asia chan and toujou koneko chan i can put my tension up with this matsuda shouted oh hes ev en shedding tears it seemed as if he was craving to talk with girls im sorry matsuda ill keep on moving ahead of you thats because
i spent my everyday life with bishoujos but there are also difficult things in it as well smack there was someone w ho smacked matsuda on the head it was the girl with glasses kiryuu im sorry for going as well she made an unpleasant face fu you are just an extra of asia chan we already have a person wearing glasses and thats motohama well its alright whats with that attitude matsuda dont put me in the same group as that perverted glasses he will just taint our group this woman motohamas glasses are special because it can calculate the bwh of girls hes different from you but kiryuu just smirked after hearing matsuda did you actually think that he is the only one with that ability all of us felt uneasy kiryuu then looked down at our crotch hmm i see i see i felt something dangerous so i hid my crotch with both hands when i l ooked motohama and matsuda had done the same after looking at our reactions kiryuus glasses shone fufufu my glasses can calculate the size of guys thingy from length to circumference whwhat a terrifying ability then does kiryuu know the size
of all the males thingy in our classroom i was getting scared but kiryuu put her hand on my shoulder and smirked its okay your size is quite big if its too big it would put down women but you still need a certain size for it yes rias senpai and asia would definitely be satisfied uoooooooo its sexual harassment im getting sexually harassed by a girl good for you asia 73 high school dxd volume 3 asia became confused with kiryuus words you dont have to tell her those kinds of things geez it cant be helped im saying that hyoudous thingy kiryuu whispered into asias ear he hey dont tell weird stuff to asia i pulled asia towards me to guard her man i cant let my guard down in front of this girl we well asia has already seen my thingy before anyway then everyone except kiba kun is going right kiryuu changed her attitude quickly after she realised that she couldnt continue this conversation no i will try to make kiba come as well somehow he did say he would come as well before yeah i will take him somehow we are going to have the
time of our life part 4 after school on the same day we gathered in the park and changed to the priests and sisters clothes after finishing our normal club activity the crosses we were wearing were fakes if they were real then we would had gotten injured we walked around town in these clothes we walked mainly in places where there werent any people i seriously wanted to get some leads today though i was thinking that time went by quickly and now it was already evening we would get in trouble if we didnt return soon this action was kept secret from buchou and the others and it would also be troublesome if we got caught by the student council fuu no progress today as well saji said as if he lost interest saji was the one who was most eager to do this this guy is truly a nice guy our first meeting was the worst but it seems like we can get along hes perverted at the same level as me you can say that hes the sitri groups vers ion of me i was thinking like that but kiba who was walking in front of
us stopped his feet yuuto senpai koneko chan also seemed like she felt something heart beat that instant i felt chills in my body this was a killing intent was it aimed at us look up saji shouted when all of us looked up there was a white haired boy priest falling down with a long sword something like a divine protection for the group of priests ay kachin kiba took his demonic sword out quickly and blocked freeds slash freed is that voice you ise kun heeee well isnt this a weird reunion how is it has your dragon power increased is it all right to kill you now this bastard has a crazy attitude like always so the sword hes holding now is the excalibur i can certainly feel the dangerous aura coming out of it just like irinas and xenovias we took off the priest clothes revealing our usual uniform koneko chan also took off her sisters outfit well a small sister also looked cute though boo sted gear74 high school dxd volume 3 boost my power increased my duty this time was to support i transferred my power boost to kiba i wanted kiba to fight
as much as he could but i would have to help if it got dangerous stretch my line swish something that looked like a skinny black hand left sajis hand and headed for freed on his hand there was a cute looking deformed lizard face equipped the line was coming from its mouth then that skinny hand was the tongue of the lizard such a pain freed tried to knock it away with his holy sword but the lizards tongue changed its direction and went downwards it stuck onto freeds right foot and it started to swirl around his leg freed tried to cut the tongue off with his swords but it went past as if the tongue didn t have any physical form you cant cut it that easily kiba with this he cant escape beat him down good work saji i see he stopped his movements freed has fast legs its a good idea to stop him from escaping you have a sharp head saji thank you kiba rushed in quickly he was going towards freed with two demonic swords chi so its not only the holy eraser i see having multiple demonic swords are you the possessor
of sword birth perhaps wow you are guilty of having a rare sacred gear you know freed seemed like he was enjoying it which was the opposite of what he was saying so he was still a crazy battle freak like always but normal demonic swords cant put up a challenge against kachin kibas two demonic swords broke after making a sound of a crack my excalibur chan ku kiba once again created demonic swords but it seemed like the excalibur was too powerful it could break the demonic swords in a single swing kiba do you want to receive my power i can st ill go on kiba declined my support it seemed he was quite ticked off well that was to be expected kiba already lost to xenovias excalibur once already his pride probably wouldnt allow him to lose this second time as well hahaha the way you look at my excalibur is scary do you perhaps hold a grudge against it well i dont know what happened to you but if you get cut by this you cant avoid being eliminated without a trace you know you will die you know you are going to die just
die freed jumped kiba tried to block him by making the demonic swords appear around the area but kachin the holy sword which was covered in white blue light broke kibas swords in a single blow freed did his second strike without any moment to spare that was bad kiba was going to get killed then i felt something weird huh am i being lifted up i looked down timidly and it was koneko chan koneko chan was lifting me up75 high school dxd volume 3 ise senpai please help yuuto senpai throw i got thrown with a lot of power i got thrown up into the air by a shoujo with super human strength uwaaah koneko chan im not an object you cant throw me uooooooooo koneko chaaaaaaaan i got closer to kiba as i screamed shit it cant be helped then kibaaaaaaaa i will transfer my power to youuuu uwah ise kun i activated my sacred gear as i approached kiba transfer it made a sound and the dragons power went into kiba there was an aura coming out of kibas body there was quite an amount of magical power covering his body i have to use it
since i received it sword birth zan there were blades coming out around the whole area from the ground from the light pole there were different shapes of blades popping out from different places chiii freed made a noise with his tongue and then started to break the demonic swords going at him swish kiba disappeared with his demonic sword as soon as he found an opening he used the demonic swords as a platform and moved around freely wow with my eyes i could only see something moving left and right thats to be expected from the knight with speed freed was following kibas movement with his eyes swish along with the sound of the wind there was a demonic sword heading towards freed kiba threw one of the demonic swords when he was using the demonic swords as a foot path no its not just one demonic sword there were several demonic swords coming from every direction uhaa that is a good circus trick you rotten devil kachin kachin kachin freed kn ocked away the demonic swords one after another with an expression of excitement my excalibur is excalibur rapidly in terms of velocity it wont lose to
anything the holy sword that freed held started to vibrate at the tip and then disappeared it meant the holy sword was moving that fast freed destroyed all of the demonic swords and then rushed towards kiba kachin its not working the demonic swords that kiba had in both hands crumbled die the moment freeds sword was going downwards at kiba pull freeds body was pulled back and he lost his balance76 high school dxd volume 3 like i would let you it was saji the lizard pulled its tongue back which made freed lose his stance at the same time the lizards tongue made a shallow light it looked like it was coming from freed and going into saji this is shit are you absorbing my powers absorbing did that tongue that was coming out of saji have some kind of special ability heh hows that this is my sacred gear absorption line as long as this line is connected to you your power will continue to be absorbed by my sacred gear yeah until you lose your consciousness that is sacred gear i see so saji is a sacred gear possessor as well so if that is connected
to you you continue to have your power absorbed and you cant even cut it with a holy sword now i dont feel like fighting against saji dragon type sacred gear is it the most troublesome type the initial ability isnt that much of a threat but when it grows the destructible power surpasses other sacred gears on a whole different level scary man it is such a nuisance freed tried to take it off again with his holy sword but there wasnt a scratch on sajis sacred gear is it the type you cant damage with physical swords and did he say dragon type that lizard is a dragon i dont understand it but thats a nice sacred gear kiba its not the time to be complaining just beat that guy the problem with the excalibur can come after that this guy is seriously dangerous just standing in front of him makes me tremble if we leave him be he will also cause harm to me and kaichou i will weaken him by absorbing his power with my sacred gear so take him down at once saji suggested a plan it was a good plan indeed i al so
thought that was the best method this guy was seriously dangerous it was better to finish him here but kiba put on a complicated expression i knew the reason he was regretting because he couldnt win with his own power but kiba should have also understood that it would be beneficial to finish him off now kiba created a demonic sword as if he had made his determination i feel reluctant but i also agree to finish you off here theres still two more excaliburs that were stolen i will have to hope that the other two are strong ha im stronger than the other two you know so the moment you four beat me there arent others who will put up with you guys are you sure if you kill me you wont have any holy sword battle that would satisfy you freed said it with a disgusting smile kibas eyes also changed after hearing that nggggg he was such a nuisance this freed was hmmm sword birth huh its a sacred gear that can have an infinite number of powers depending on the possessor then there was the voice of another person when i looked that way there
was an old man wearing priest clothes standing there is it you old man valper everyone became shocked at freeds word valper isnt valper the guy who xenovia was talking about the one who disposed of kiba and his comrades during the holy sword project just like the excaliburs what a fateful meeting valper galilei kiba glared at the old man with eyes full of hatred i certainly am the old man admitted it normall y so this guy was kibas enemy freed what are you doing77 high school dxd volume 3 oldman i cant run away because of this guys weird lizard tongue hmph you still cant use the holy sword perfectly yet use the element i gave you more wisely im researching because of that gather the holy element that is running throughout your body to the blade of the holy sword with that you should be able to cut it yeah yeah freeds holy sword had started to gather auras and started to glow like this horyah cut sajis sacred gear was cut with ease and the only thing that was holding freed was gone this was bad he was going to escape i will be escaping
now the next time we meet will be the time of our ultimate battle freed said that but i wont let you escape there was someone who went past me with a very fast speed kachin there was a blade clashing with freeds holy sword that was igniting sparks it was xenovia yaho ise kun irina irina was also here as well ooooh the partners of our cooperati on were here freed sellzen valper galilei rebels i will cut you both down in the name of god ha dont say the name of the hateful god that i hate you bitch freed and xenovia exchanged swords but he took something out it was a ball of light that was the item used for escaping oldman valper we are escaping we are going to report to the boss kokabiel theres no other way see ya the alliance of church and devils freed threw down the ball of light on the ground flash i couldnt see anything the light covered the whole area and blinded our eyes by the time we regained our sight freed and valper were gone shit we came all the way here and we lost track of him
we are going after them irina okay xenovia and irina nodded at each other and sprinted from here im going after them too i wont let you escape valper galilei hehey kiba geez whats going on everyone was doing whatever they felt like the ones who stayed behind were me koneko chan and saji we loosened our battle stances and took a breath then i felt the presence of someone behind me when i thought that the flow of power was irregular this is certainly troublesome78 high school dxd volume 3 i turned around after hearing a familiar voice and ise whats the meaning of this explain buchou and kaichou were standing there with serious faces i turned blue part 5 destroying excalibur you two buchou didnt have a pleasant face and she put her hand on her forehead after the incident with freed buchou and kaicho u took the three of us saji koneko chan and me to the nearby park then we were forced to do seiza 6in front of the fountain saji you wer e doing something like this behind me you truly are a troublesome child auuui im sorry kaichou kaichou was also talking to saji
with a cold expression sajis face became so blue that it was dangerous he must have been truly scared so yuuto went after that person called valper yes i think hes with irina and xenovia i think that hes going to call us if something happens do you think yuuto who became an avenger would call us normally you are absolutely right buchou then looked at koneko chan koneko yes why did you do this i dont want yuuto senpai to go away koneko chan told her true feelings buchou looked confused rather than angry when she heard that saying this when it has already happened wont change anyt hing i guess but what you two did could have affected the world of devils you understand that right yes yes koneko chan and i nodded our heads at the same time we understood that very well no we didnt know how serious it was i was acting while thinking that there was a bit of danger involved so the scale of this case that buchou imagined and the one i imagined are different seems like i was taking it too lightly im sorry buchou im sorry buchou koneko chan and
i bowed our heads i didnt think she would forgive us with this but i had to im truly sorry buchou slap slap when i looked at the direction from where the sound was coming from saji was there getting his butt spanked oooou saji what a sad view looks like y ou need to reflect on your behaviour uwaaaaaaan im sorry im sorry please forgive me kaichouuu no 1000 spankings79 high school dxd volume 3 slap slap kaichou was covering her hand with demonic power he was getting spanked with that hand it seemed quite painfull man getting that when you are a high school student must be truly painfull hey ise dont look away i sent my familiar to search for yuuto lets go to him with the rest of the club members when he is found we will decide what to do from there okay yes yes koneko chan and i replied to buchous words hug buchou pulled us to her and hugged us i could feel buchous warmth you two really are stupid children making me worry so much buchou said it with a gentle voice while she patted me and koneko chans head buchou im
sorry to make you worry about us aaaah i can feel her kindness im glad im her servant to have a kind master like her uwaaaaaaan kaichouuu they finished with a good atmosphere they are them we ar e us slap slap it looked like sajis spanking wasnt going to end anytime soon looks like making kaichou pregnant and marrying her is really far away now ise show me your bottom huh bu buchoudidnt you forgive me buchou smiled with her hand covered with a crimson coloured aura its the masters duty to discipline their servants youre also getting 1000 spankings that day my ass died part 6 by the time buchou and i arrived home the sun was setting it was almost night time w e parted ways with koneko chan along our way home she was apologising to buchou until she left but she seemed like she didnt regret it same as me also kiba he followed those guys but he should be safe right and most of all my ass hurts i felt the love buchou has towards her servants with my own butt we are back when buchou and i took our shoes off and were

asked him but he just shook his shoulder with a laugh was that pressure from before coming from this guy no i could feel something weird from this guy but that was it that heavy pressure surpassed that of a high class devil buchou seemed like she noticed something and looked up there was someone floating in the sky with the moon behind him it was afallen angel who had his black wings growing out from his back one two three he had 10 black wings it was a young man who was wearing a black robe with detailed accessories he smirked after seeing buchou this is our first time meeting daughter of the house of gremory the crimson hair is beautiful it reminds me of your brother t hat i hate enough to make me want to vomit uoooo he suddenly gave such a provocative speech i could feel hatred coming from his words buchou also had a cold face s scary nice to meet you one of the leaders of the fallen angels kokabiel and my name is rias gremory i will also add one more thing we and the house of gremory are a being who are
closest to the satan and also the furthest from it if you are here to discuss about politics with me then its no use kokabiel the kokabiel the leader of the fallen angels isnt he the actual guy who appears in the bible and books hes so famous crap this is certainly bad if i looked kokabiel was carrying something i looked carefullya person was he carrying a person this is a gift he then threw the person he was carrying at me oh i reacted immediately and tried to catch it catch the one who dropped into my arms wasshidou irina she was covered in blood she was breathing heavily her whole body was covered in wounds did this happen after she went to chase freed what happened to kiba and xenovia hhey irina even though i called her she reacted painfully and didnt respond this looked bad she came into my base so i gave her a welcome well i couldnt catch the other two kokabiel said it with a laugh from his story kiba and xenovia escaped83 high school dxd volume 3 asia i put irina on the ground and made asia heal her there was a
green light coming out of asias body which covered irina irinas expression started to soften and she started to breathe gently she didnt have her excalibur what happened to it kokabiel continued to talk without caring about my doubts i wouldnt do something as stupid as talking with a satan well if i rape and kill his little sister then sirzechs anger will be pointed towards me that wont be bad buchou glared at kokabiel with disdainful eyes so what is your motive for contacting me kokabiel answered buchous question with joy i will be rampaging in this town using your base kuoh academy as the starting point then sirzechs will also appear right whwhat if you do something like that the war between god fallen angels and devils will begin again you know thats what im wishing for i thought that michael would start a war if i steal the excalibur but what he sent were grunt exorcists and two holy sword wielders its boring im really bored indeed thats why im going to rampage at sirzechs sisters base see it looks fun right buchou made a sound with her tongue it was proof that buchou was really pissed
but what insane plan was he trying to pull isnt michael an angel who is the most important next to god even someone like me who was new to this world has seen his name in books hes trying to start a w ar with someone big like that to be expected from the leader of fallen angels you battle freak buchou said it with hatred but kokabiel laughed with joy yeah thats it i was bored and bored after the war between the three sides azazel and sham za werent that keen on the next war they then started to collect something boring like sacred gear and started to do some weird research something useless like that wont be of any use to us well its a different story if its a boosted gear like the one the brat over there has but its not something you can find so easily kokabiel then looked at me what enormous pressure my body was shaking unbelievably i then said it with a strong voice are you guys also after my sacred gear at lea st im not interested in it but azazel might be his collection hobby is crazy azazel i
think he was the governor of the fallen angels is he collecting sacred gears either way im going to be starting a battle involving the holy swords rias gremor y for starting a war a school where both little sisters of sirzechs and leviathans go to it must be filled with demonic powers so that i can enjoy the chaos its also the best place to release the real power of excaliburs its a good place for the battlefield he was talking nonsense he was seriously crazy hyahahaha isnt my boss the best his craziness is the best so im also eager to do it he even gives me treats like this what freed took out was an excalibur he had one of them in each hand he also had two of them on his hips the one on the right is excalibur rapidly the one on the left is excalibur nightmare the one on my hip is excalibur transparent i also received excalibur mimic from the girl over there i also feel like84 high school dxd volume 3 getting excalibur destruction that the other girl has hyaa am i the first person in the world to be in possession
of this many excaliburs i also received an element from the geezer valper that allows me to wield holy swords right now im in a hyper mode that allows me to wield all of them you know im invincible im wonderful im the strongest hyahahahahahahahaha freed laughed as if he found it really funny valpers holy sword research its the real deal if it shows this much result to tel l the truth it seemed suspicious when he joined my plan so kokabiel and valper are together what are you planning to do with the excaliburs buchou asked him kokabiel moved his ten black wings and moved his body in the direction of the school hah aha lets have a war little sister of sirzechs lucifer rias gremory flash freed took out an item to blind us this again our sight was taken away for a while but by the time it returned kokabiel and freed were gone ise we are going to the school yes a big battle against the leader of the fallen angels was about to start85 high school dxd volume 3 life4 go occult research club part 1 rias senpai we have covered the school with
a large barrier with this unless something disastrous happens there will be no damage outside saji reported the current situation to buchou we the occult research club and the student council had gathered at the park located right in front of kuoh academy only kiba wasnt there where are you kiba the injured irina was transported to kaichous house she avoided the worst case scenario thanks to asias power saji from the student council was explaining about the barrier to buchou possibly because of the spanking he got earlier he stood unnaturally according to his story shitori souna senpai who is the kaichou had gathered everyone from the student council and put a big barrier on the school after she heard the situation from buchou it was a measure used to keep the things occurring inside from leaking outside the opponent was one of the leaders of the fallen angels who appeared in the bible and books this is to keep it to the minimum to tell you the truth if kokabiel were to fight seriously not only this academy but the whole region would be annihilated adding to that he has already gotten ready for that my servant has
seen him releasing his power at the school grounds wha i became speechless at kaichous words are you serious we are talking about something that big so it meant he was someone that serious he seriously was a troublesome fallen angel leader he was going to destroy my town because he wanted to do what he wished which was to start a war dont mess around dont fuck around you shitty fallen angel i wont let you do as you please im planning to live and enjoy my life in this town with buchou asia and everyone my anger was at its max and kaichou continued to explain my servants and i will continue to place the barrier to reduce the damages i want to minimise the damag es as much as possible its hard to prevent having our school getting damaged but it looks like we have to since its the leader of the fallen angels who is moving kaichou made a sharp eye and looked in the direction of the school with eyes filled wit h hatred she was probably directing it at kokabiel then it was confirmed that the school would get damaged the school iwe go
to thank you sona we will do the rest from here rias our enemy is a monster with strength above ours its still not too late we should get your onii sama buchou shook her head you also didnt call your onee sama my onee sama is your onii sama loves you sirzechs sama will definitely move so i have already informed sirzechs sama akeno san said it over buchou and kaichous words akeno buchou criticised but akeno san had an angry expression rias i know that you dont want to cause problems for sirzechs sama it happened in your territory in your base and it happened after the family problem but its a different story if the leader of the enemy appears it is a problem that surpasses the level that you can solve lets borrow the strength of a maou it was my first time seeing akeno san telling buchou off but just as i thought akeno san cal ls her rias during private times and talks casually towards her buchou seemed like she wanted to say86 high school dxd volume 3 something but she took a deep breath and nodded akeno san put on her usual smiley
face after she saw her thank you for understanding the situation buchou sona sama sirzechs samas reinforcement will be here in one hour one hour i understand in that time we the student council will vow to continue to place the barriers in the name of sitri buchou seemed like she had made her decision as w ell after hearing kaichous decision so one hour now my servants we will be on the offensive we will go inside the barrier and draw kokabiels attention unlike the battle against phoenix this is a battle of life and death even so i will not forgive you if you die we will survive and continue to attend that school yes we replied to her with energetic voices hyoudou i will leave the rest to you i know that saji you should worry about the damages on your ass dont say that it feels like it will hurt even more if you say that how about your ass ngggh my ass started to hurt after he said that fufufu buchous love certainly hurts well the situation right now is the same as having our asses on fire no no i cant laugh at that
so kiba isnt here yet yeah i believe that he is safe yeah i also believe in him as well saji and i put our fist together and prayed for our missions it was a decisive battle if it became serious then i would also leave it to me partne r our opponent is kokabiel hes not an insufficient opponent lets show him yeah ddraig we will show him the power of the dragon that picked a fight with god and maou part 2 we went in straight from the main gate the moment i entered i used prom otion to promote from pawn to queen so my power increased my queen was still weak compared to akeno san because i had only been a devil for a short time i became speechless after seeing a bizarre scene in the middle of the school field there were four swords that were releasing extreme lights while floating having the swords at the centre there was a suspicious looking magic circle spread in the whole school field there was an old man located in the middle of the magic circle valper galilei that geezer what was he planning to do by using
the magic circle what is this i spoke out my doubt im going to make the four excaliburs into one valper said it as if he found it amusing valper how much longer will it take for the excaliburs to merge 87 high school dxd volume 3 there was a voice from up in the sky when all of the club members looked up there was kokabiel who had the moon as a background he was sitting on a chair up in the sky while looking down on us was it the power of a fallen angel that w as making the chair float he was crossing his legs confidently it wont even take 5 minutes kokabiel is that so i will leave it to you kokabiel moved his eyes from valper to buchou is sirzechs coming or is it serafall in the places of onii sama and leviathan sama we swish bannnnnnnnnnnnnng after the sound of the wind there was a sound of explosion that echoed throughout the area the sound came from the place where the gym is no where the gym was there wasnt even a trace of it did it get blown away boring well thats
okay it will be entertaining there was a big pillar made of light where the gym was located was that perhaps the spear of light yoyou must be joking thats too big if compared with that fallen angel wom an it was like comparing a toothpick and a fishing rod if i was to get hit by that are you scared partner ddraig directly talked to me of course i would get scared after seeing that it was not a matter of being beyond us it was totally on a different level to us yeah its on a different level he is so strong that his name has been recorded in the bible since ancient times he is the one who survived the battle against god and the past maou can we win can i beat him if it becomes serious i will beat him even if i have to turn most of your body into a dragon even if you cant beat him i will give him damage that will freeze him for an hour you can leave the rest to the maou so hes that powerful looks like i have to make my decision as well well using
the armour will be my last resort that only makes me strong for 10 seconds the power of my balance breaker that ignores the limit of my stamina and demonic powers would become invincible once i activate it but after using that i cant use my sacred gear for three whole days using it would be a sink or swim situation now i will have you all fight my pet that i brought from hell kokabiel clicked his fingers then from the depths of darkness there was a sound of the ground rumbling as it came closer to us that thing was something that far exceeded my expectations eightno it probably was ten meters tall with a large body it had four legs and each leg was thick also the claws that grew from each leg looked so sharp that i f elt chills behind my back the eyes that were glittering from the darkness were red from its mouth what it had were dangerous looking fangs the fangs were close to each other and from the gaps there were white breaths pouring out the animal which resembled it the most was adog but dogs arent this big thats because
dogs dont have three heads roooooooooooar its howl was so loud it felt like it shook the ground the three heads howled at the same time cerberus buchou said it with a voice fi lled with disgust cerberus yes its a famous creature that has the nickname of guard dog of hell88 high school dxd volume 3 guard dog of hell so this dog was a monster that sounded that dangerous it lives in the gate to hell no to the underworld but to bring it to the humans world is it bad we have to do it we will blow it away ise ooou buchou shes pumped up then i will have to be pumped as well yes buchou lets do it boosted gear boost okay doggy since it looks like you havent been tamed properly i will have to discipline you i was enthusiastic to do it but buchou put her hand on my shoulder ise this time we will back you up so do i give him the finishing blow by charging my power buchou shook her head at my question no i wi ll have you support us you will be transferring your boosted power to
us boosted gear is a sacred gear that powers you up and also increases the power of your comrades in a team battle increasing the power of comrades by using the ability of gift if i were to transfer the boosted power to buchou and akeno san who were stronger than the normal me also in terms of healing if i were to increase asias ability then the effect would become absolute so im going to put my boosted power on top of the group members then perhaps it might be effective against kokabiel even if we cant give him an enormous amount of damage we might gain the power to block his attacks by the way ise including your power up how many times can you transfer your powers buchous question yes my sacred gear had a limit to how many times i could use it my sacred gear that can multiply my power belongs to an unreal category the number of times i can use it depends on the possessor me if i were to use it up the sacred g ear would stop functioning then my body would lose all strength right now with my current stamina
i can only transfer it 3 or 4 times with the maximum boost no i might faint after the fourth time so please think that i can only do it three times i see so we cant waste it im sorry buchou if i were to use it with fewer boosts i could use it a bit more but because of the one we are facing it wouldnt be like that somehow it felt like i had turned into a useful item for the whole day well thats okay akeno buchou got her wings out from her back and flew up into the sky with akeno san gaaaaaaruuuuuuuuuuuu cerberus jumped after making a growl flaaaaaaaaaaame one of the heads looked towards buchou who was flying and breathed out fire wow it seriously was a monster too nave akeno san stood in front of buchou and froze the fire instantly just to be expected from our queen take this89 high school dxd volume 3 buchou jumped from behind akeno san and released an enormous black block of demonic power the blow from the power of destruction buchous demonic power is a powerful one that eliminates everything it touches flaaaaaaaaaame the other
head of the monstrous dog shot out a ball of fire buchous demonic power and the fireball of cerberus clashed against each other violently then the other head shot out a fireball shit three attacks in a row the second fireball assisted the first one that was getting pushed by buchous strike the strength of fire increased and it started to push buchous str ike then cerberus tried to shoot another one if it did another one then even if it was buchou i have found an opening in you bang koneko chan who jumped from beside me did a heavy blow onto cerberuss head it made a loud sound i dont want to get hit by that koneko chan heres another blow when akeno san pointed her fingers up there was lightning created in the sky she then pointed her fingers to cerberus and flash after a single flash cerberus was surrounded by violent lightning akeno san gave an extra special lightning to the doggy buchous blow also added to that but cerberus body didnt get terminated and it just struck the side of its stomach there was dark black blood coming out of the monster dogs stomach there
was smoke c oming from it but it still had a shine in its eyes it could still move even after receiving those attacks and my power up it still hadnt reached the limit i was promoted to queen but i hadnt become as strong as the queen akeno san was i still lacked training my stats as a devil were still low i wanted to get stronger i was definitely going to survive this battle then i was going to get even stronger and become the ultimate pawn that buchou was talking about garuuuuuuuu ummmm i could hear a dangerous howl i turned around with scared thoughts and theres another one another cerberus appeared from the darkness dont joke around its not a joking matter that another one appeared gaaaaaaaaooooo it made a howl and it came towards me and asia crap should we run the boosts wont get reset as long as i dont attack and receive any attacks i had to run while carrying asia but it seemed like there was nowhere to run to in a school field like this ise just use the boost to inc rease your powers buchou gave me the permission to
use the boosted power that would be the best choice but if i used it here then it seemed like it would be used just to run away but it couldnt be helped if it was to protect asia it happened when i was about to do it slash one of the heads of the cerberus that was coming at us went up into the sky it was cut by who kiba but the person who appeared was the one who wielded a long excalibur it was xenovia the head of the cerberus that was cut t urned to dust i have come to back you up step90 high school dxd volume 3 after saying that xenovia went on slashing towards the cerberus torso the cerberus howled in pain because it lost one of its heads gaaaaaaooooooo the cerberus torso split in half after receiving a f atal strike there was smoke coming out and the cerberus started to vaporise it was the effect of the holy sword the strike of the holy sword it gives critical damage to creatures stab xenovia thrust her sword deep into the cerberus chest to finis h it off that moment the cerberus body
turned into dust and disappeared my gauntlet started to flash it hadnt even reached the limit but what was this phenomenon i was feeling doubtful when ddraig talked to me its telling you that it has reached the stage where the cerberus can be defeated if you transfer it to rias gremory or himejima akeno are you serious since when did it get such a convenient system it means that both you and the sacred gear are evolving day by day it has made possible what you desired as you cant tell the power difference between you and the opponent you didnt know how many boosts you needed it has started to tell you now i certainly thought about that but it actually responded to my weak point so it means it c an respond to the power difference between me and my opponent now thats certainly a good thing i shouted towards buchou and akeno san who were flying up the sky buchou akeno san i have got enough power to take down cerberus hearing that buchou and akeno san looked at each other and nodded both of them came down to me at the same time ise you
increased the strength of the cross and holy water in the battle against riser right eh ah i certainly did so its possible to increase both of us at the same time then please transfer the power to akeno and i ddraig it was all of a sudden that time but is it possible yeah if its just two at the same time then its possible except that i can only transfer 70 to 80 percent of the boosted power i explained that to buchou and akeno san the two of them were okay with it i think that would be enough yes we can do it please buchou and akeno san replied at the same time i put my hand on buchous and akeno sans shoulders and activat ed my sacred gear lets do it boosted gear transfer heartbeat an enormous amount of power went to buchou and akeno san through my body they instantly gained an enormous amount of demonic power both of them were shocked at the amount of power th at was overflowing from them we can do this91 high school dxd volume 3 akeno san nodded to buchous daring smile akeno yes thunder resound akeno
san pointed her fingers to the sky and started to control the thunder her fingers were aimed towards the cerberus the c erberus tried to run from the spot as if it predicted the upcoming thunder stab countless swords pierced through the cerberus limb the swords were coming out from the ground this is i wont let you escape the person who appeared was our knight it was kibas sword birth that guy came at a good time flash the thunder went down at cerberus after it lost its movement due to the demonic swords the lightning was so big that it couldnt be compared to the one before the lightning covered more tha n half of the school grounds ruuuuuuumbleeeeee the howl of the cerberus was overshadowed by the sound and its body turned to nothingness from the lightning because of its major power up the potential demonic energy got used up rapidly responding to the strength of it even if it was buchou and akeno san continuous shots would have been hard for them as well the moment the big dog disappeared buchou pointed her hand towards kokabiel take this kokabiel doooooooooooooonnnn there was a gigantic mass of
demonic power that shot out from buchous hand its huge i slipped my words it was more than 10 times bigger than the usual shot buchou fires it gained high velocity and went towards the leader of the fallen angels who was sitting up in t he sky the power of destruction fell on top of kokabiel perish with that but he just stretched one of his hands to the front baaaaaaaang he was blocking buchous shot with only one of his hands you must be joking he stopped a gigantic shot like that with only one hand guuun kokabiel faced his palm towards the sky the shot that was fired by buchou changed its direction and went up to the sky and disappeared kokabiel showed his malicious smile after seeing the smoke coming out of his hand i see rias gremorys power would grow this much because of the power of sekiryutei interesting this is very interesting indeed kukuku kokabiel started to laugh by himself as if he find it funny its complete valpers voice then the four excaliburs that were placed on the center of the school field started giving out incredible amounts of light what is it
what was happening kokabiel started applauding the four excaliburs are going to become one92 high school dxd volume 3 it started giving out divine light that spread throughout the school field because of its brightness we covered our faces with our hands when i stared at the center of the school field i saw that the four excaliburs were put on top of each other excalibur that was originally one it was split into s even but four of them were going to become one when the bright lights were gone there was one holy sword at the center of the field giving out a blue white aura because of the light created by the excalibur when it turned into one the spell on the gr ound is also complete this town will collapse within 20 minutes the only way to dispel it is by beating kokabiel valper said something astonishing i became speechless of course because the town i live in would collapse in less than 20 minutes the m agic circle spread around the whole school field and it started glowing and gathering power did it activate are you serious is the town i live in is the
town we live in seriously going to disappear lies thats a lie we didnt have the time to be saying something so easygoing like we have to withstand it until sirzechs sama and the others arrive by the time maou samas reinforcement would have arrived this town would already have been blown away freed kokabiel called out the name of that s hitty priest whats up boss a white haired boy priest emerged from the darkness use the excalibur in the circle it shall be the last entertainment fight while using the excalibur that has turned into one from the four excaliburs yeah yeah geez my boss sure uses people recklessly but but its like im so honoured to use the excalibur chan that has become super wonderful something like that uhehehe i will just chop some devils now freed put on a crazy smile while holding the excalibur located at the centre of the school field so he could use it he did say that he received a factor from valper xenovia then spoke to kiba rias gremorys knight if the cooperation is still valid let us destroy that excalibur together is it okay xenovia laughed fearlessly at kibas
words at worst it wont be a problem if i collect the fragment of the excalibur that is acting as the core of it since freed is wielding it that is a holy sword but it isnt a holy sword even if its a holy sword its the same as any other weapon it changes depending on the person using it that is a sword of heresy kukuku someone was laughing at the duos conversation it was valper valper galilei i am a survivor of the holy sword project no i am the one who was killed by you to be more precise i have continued living by being reincarnated into a devil kiba said calmly to valper but his eyes were filled with flames of hatred depending on valpers answer it might become an explosive situation hou the survivor of that project this is such a misfortune to meet you in a far east country like this i feel fate fufufu what a disgusting way of laughing it was like he was making a fool out of us you see i like holy swords i like them so much that they come out in my dreams possibly because my
heart was fascinated by the legend of excalibur since i was a child thats why when i found out that i cant use excalibur i went into despair valper suddenly started talking about his life a s tory about the geezers past huh93 high school dxd volume 3 i held admiration for those who can wield it because i couldnt that feeling became so powerful that i started an experiment to create those who can use them then it was complete its thanks to you and the others what complete you disposed of us after finding us to be a failure kiba lifted his eyebrows seemingly in doubt from kiba buchou and xenovias story i heard that the experiment failed didnt they dispose of them because they found them to be a failure but valper shook his head i realised that there was an essential factor needed to wield holy swords so i used the numerical value of the factors to investigate its capability most of the test subjects had the elements but they didnt have the numerical value needed to wield the excalibur then i reached a conclusion is there a way to take out the elements and gather
them i see i understand now the thing that is put inside the holy sword wielders when they received a blessing is xenovia se emed like she learned the truth and grit her teeth hatefully wh what did she mean i was in doubt and valper continued to talk thats right holy sword wielder girl we take out the holy elements from those who have them and crystallise them just like t his valper took out an orb that was giving out light it was a shiny orb it has the so called holy aura in it with this the research on holy sword wielders improved even so those fools from the church banished me for heresy and took away my reports on the research by looking at you i see that the project was succeeded by someone that michael he made me look like a criminal and this is the result well its that angel we are talking about even if he takes the elements out from the test subjects he wouldnt go as far as to kill them that part only would make him more human than me kukukuku valper laughed pleasantly i see even an idiot like
me understood now at present to create holy sword users artificially it required a sacrifice so ki ba and xenovia were victims of the project started by valper you killed my comrades and took out the elements needed to wield the holy swords kiba asked valper with his voice filled with killing intent thats right this orb is from back then i have used three of them on freed though this is the last one hyahahahaha other guys besides me died because their bodies couldnt synchronise with the elements hmmmmm if i think like that that makes me special if it was just like freed said then the other ones who stole the excalibur died chi it would have been better if freed was the one to die guys like him end up being tough you thought that guys like me would end up being tough didnt you ise kun no no i wont die easily like that dont read my thoughts shitty priest valper galilei how many lives have you sacrificed for your greed and experiments kibas hands were shaking and there was an aura of anger coming out of his body what an incredible intensity hm if you
say th at then i will give this orb to you my research has reached the stage where it is possible to mass produce them in the right environment first of all i will destroy this town with kokabiel next i will gather the legendary holy swords stored around the world then i will mass produce holy sword wielders and start a war against michael and the vatican with the combined excaliburs im going to show the result of my research to those foolish angels and their followers who have convicted me so that was t he reason why kokabiel and valper teamed up both of them had hatred towards the angels both of them sought war they were the worst pair valper threw away the orb as if he had lost94 high school dxd volume 3 interest in it it rolled on the ground and went to kibas foot kiba leaned down silently and picked it up he patted the orb sadly lovingly and dearly everyone there was a tear on kibas cheek his expression was filled with sadness and anger then it happened the orb that kiba held started giving out shallow light s the lights started to
spread and it eventually covered the whole school field from the ground there were lights coming out and it started to form a shape then it formed into a proper shape it took the shape of people there were boys and girls who were giving out blue white lights and they were surrounding kiba were they perhaps the various powers that are present on this battlefield made the spirits within the orbs appear akeno san said things like this happen demonic swords holy swords dev ils and fallen angels everything was present here so it was not weird for this to happen they looked at kiba with a dear and sad expression everyone i i yes even i understood they were also the ones who were involved in the holy sword project they were the ones who were disposed of i have alwaysalways thought about it was it all right that i was the only one that survived there were those who had more dreams than me there were those who wanted to live more than me is it all right tha t i am the only one to have a peaceful life then one boys spirit smiled and it
seemed like he wanted to say something he was moving his lips but i couldnt understand what he was saying because i couldnt read lips then akeno san read it for me dont worry about us any more you are alive at least thats what they are saying there were tears coming out from both of his eyes because it seemed like their thoughts reached him then the spirits of boys and girls started to move their lips in a rhythm were they singing the sacred song asia mumbled they were singing the sacred song kiba started to sing while shedding tears when they were going through the painful experiment this was the only thing they obtained to keep their hopes and dreams this was the only support they had to continue living during their harsh life kiba and his comrades had the smiles of innocent children their bodies started to glow blue white those lights were getting brighter with kiba in the center we were no good alone we didnt have enough elements to wield the holy swords but it will be okay if we are together i could also hear their voices i heard that originally the sacred
song was supposed to make us devils suffer maybe because there were di fferent types of powers in this place i didnt feel any pain at all instead i felt warmth something warm that was thinking about friends and comrades there were tears flowing out of my eyes suddenly you have to accept the holy sword its not scary even if god is watching our hearts are always one their spirits went up into the heaven and they turned into a big light that fell down to kiba95 high school dxd volume 3 partner then ddraig spoke to me what is it in an emotional situation like this that kn ight has reached it im asking what do you mean sacred gears change and evolve while using the feelings of the possessors as a key but there is a different territory to that when the feelings and the wishes of the possessor does a dramatic change that it changes the flow of this world the sacred gear reaches it yes this is ddraig made a laugh of enjoyment balance break the light that split the abyss night looked as if it was giving blessings to kiba96 high school dxd volume

feelings of me and my comrades chi freed clicked his tongue and stepped back after he pushed me back stretccccccch his excalibur started to twist as if it were alive it moved randomly and came towards me with intense speed the ability of excalibur mimic i see it has four of the abilities then his sword split into two at the tip of the blade and started to come at me with god speed this is the ability of excalibur rapidly if i remember its trait was its velocity it accurately tried to pierce me from every direction but i blocked each strike your killing intent is easy to read if i know which direction the killing intent is coming from parrying it is very easy why why isnt it hitting you are supposed to be the unrivaled holy sword sama arent you werent you supposed to have lots of legends of being the ultimate sword freed shouted i could see that his expression was filled with both enjoyment and impatience then then i have to add this as well the tip of the holy sword disappeared transparency pheromone this is the power of excalibur transparency the ability to make
the blade transparent but if he doesnt change the directi on of his killing intent even if i cant see the blade giin gin gin giiin the transparent sword and my sword made sparks i was parrying all of his attacks freed narrowed his eyes and made a shocked face yes keep him there like that xenovi a suddenly intruded she held the holy sword in her left hand and put her right hand in the air saint peter saint basil the great saint denis holy mother mary please hear my voice she started to chant something what was she trying to do i was in doubt but the space in front of me got distorted xenovia put her hand in the middle of the distorted space she put her hand in and pulled something right out of the dimensional gap what appeared was a single sword that gave out a holy aura in the names of the saints whom reside within this blade i will release it durandal100 high school dxd volume 3 durandal its a sword that is so famous that it is on par with excalibur and i have it that in terms of slashing it is
the ultimate sword why does she have it a durandal you were not the wielder of the excalibur not just valper even kokabiel couldnt hide his astonishment wrong i was originally the wielder of durandal i was also chosen as the holder of the excalibur thats all xenovia made a stance with durandal two sword style along with the excalibur absurd according to my research we havent reached the stage where someone can wield durandal of course even in the vatican they havent made someone who can wield durandal artificially then w hy unlike those common artificial holy sword wielders like irina im a natural born wielder valper became speechless at her words unlike us xenovia was someone who was blessed to naturally wield the holy sword durandal is a sword that ravages beyond what people can imagine it cuts anything it touches it doesnt even listen to me most of the time thats why i have to keep it in another dimension otherwise it would be dangerous even i the holder has a hard time with it now freed sellzen t hanks to you we can have the decisive battle between excalibur and durandal right now im shaking with
enjoyment dont die in a single strike okay at least use the excalibur to its fullest the blade of durandal started to give out more holy aura than the excalibur freed held that aura it had more power than my holy demonic sword is that even allowed it became a situation like this you shitty bitch i dont need any of that for this setting freed shouted and moved his killing intent to xenovi a i couldnt see with my eyes but he probably slashed his transparent sword towards her gakiiin with a single side slash the excalibur shattered because of the pressure given by the swing of durandal there was a big hole in the school field so it s just a broken holy sword huh it cant even compete with my durandal xenovia made a sigh while looking bored what an incredible power it cant even be compared with her excalibur destruction are you serious are you really serious the legendary excalibur chan is shattered into pieces horrible this is really horrible kaaaa was it wrong to use something that was broken from the start the shallowness of humans the foolishness of the church i want to grow
up while taking a glimpse of it his killing intent became weak and i went right at him he also couldnt respond to it checkmate he tried to block my holy demonic sword with the remnants of his excalibur but baaakiiin a shallow shattering sound echoed the sound of the excalibur cr umbling did you see it our powers have surpassed excalibur i cut down freed as soon as i shattered the excalibur part 2101 high school dxd volume 3 freed fell down while blood came out of the wound i made from his shoulder to the side of his stomach i won we surpassed the excalibur i gripped the holy demonic sword hard and looked up to the sky rather than an inexpressible feeling the feeling of losing my aim was greater it felt like the only reason i was livingthe only reason i was allowed to livedisappeared hoholydemonic sword impossible the polar opposite of two things can not merge valper galilei made a strong expression thats right it hasnt finished yet as long as i dont defeat him the tragedy will continue we can not allow other people to meet the same fate as us valper galilei prepare
yourself i pointed my holy demonic sword at him and tried to slash at him now my comrades lets finish it with this lets finish everything i see i understand now holy and demonic it will be an explanation if the beings that represent the two become unbalanced then not only did the maou die but so did stab a spear of light pierced through valpers chest who seemed like he realised something this is gough valper went down after throwing a solid amount of blood i went up to him to confirm his state and he had already passed away valper you were remarkable the reason you went up to that conclusion proves that but i dont mind whether you are with me or not i could have done it by myself from the beginning kokabiel who was up in the air was sneering the one who killed valper was kokabiel hahahaha kahahahahahahahaha kokabiel laughed loudly and landed on the ground an overwhelming pressure the leader of the fallenangels finally stood in front of us while sending out an intense aura and confidence while smiling fearlessly he said increase the power of the sekiryuutei and transfer it to someone
else he made an order full of confidence and buchou got enraged are you try ing to give us a chance dont mess around dont mess around hahaha you guys are the ones who are messing around do you guys think you can defeat me just being stared at with those eyes felt like my body would get pierced my whole body was controlled by fear this is the pressure of the fallen angel that has been recorded in the bible since ancient times there was sweat coming from my hand that was holding onto the holy demonic sword and the cold feeling continued up to my finger tips this shiv ering couldnt be compared to the one i had in the battle against the house of phoenix battle to the death you couldnt stand in this place unless you were prepared to die and you had to accept the fact that it wouldnt be weird to lose your life i hav e to change my motivation even if my grudge disappeared the battle hasnt my comrades wished for my survival i need to live on i will go through this battle i will live on as a devil and
as a part of the gremory group please lend me your strength the holy demonic sword created by me and my comrades feelings ise activate your sacred gear ise answered buchous order102 high school dxd volume 3 boost along with the mechanical sound a red light emanated from his sacred gear a few minutes from then we couldnt move a single step we were waiting for ise kuns boost while not moving an inch we could have gone towards the fallen angel if he let his guard down but the fallen angel didnt show a single chance while he just stood still i could only imagine getting cou ntered by him if i went against him so we couldnt make a fatal move most likely everyone here was in the same situation i could only wait for the power of the sekiryuutei to increase while swallowing my saliva and trembling its here isekuns ga untlet emitted a brighter light the boost had probably reached the limit now who will you transfer it to kokabiel asked with an interested voice the one who put their hand up to kokabiels question wasbuchou ise yes isekun started to transfer the power at buchous
call both of them held onto each others hand from their clasped hands i could feel the aura of trust and the unspoken love they had towards each other the light on the jewel passed onto buchou and the red aura that covered her body increased drastically i felt the great amount of aura from her with my skin and an enormous amount of power was created within her hand an amount that seemed like it wouldnt even leave a single speck of dust if you were hit by that the majority of people would perish but her opponent was fuhahaha good that flow of demonic power the demonic power i can feel right now is that of an ultimate class devil a little bit more then you would reach that of a maou rias gremory looks like you have a talent equal to that of your brothers the fallen angel leader laughed as if he was truly enjoying it his expression was coloured in ecstasy he was feelingpleasure for war blow awaaaaaaaaay from buchous hand the highest amount of the block of demonic power was shot out covered in the power of destruction gooooooooon it made a shock wave
that felt like it shook the ground and the powerful shot was heading towards kokabiel with his hand no with both his hands put in front of him he tried to deflect it interesting interesting indeed maous sister on kokabiels hand the energy of the fallen angels the power of light gathered doooooooooooon kokabiel took buchous shot head on his expression surpassed that of a normal one and looked dreadful nuuuuuuuuuun buchous shot started to get pushed back and started to lose its shape he couldnt be defeated even with that amount of demonic power but kokabiel also wasnt uninjured his black robe was tattered in places and hi s hands were bloody but his ability to block demonic power certainly decreased possibly because of the attack she just performed buchous breathing was ragged it would be impossible to shoot out the same attack also because of the amount of demonic power she just used shooting103 high school dxd volume 3 another one would be what was left was for ise kun to boost his powers again and transfer it to another person but who could beat kokabiel akeno san xenovia who held the durandal even i who had reached
balance breaker could only give him a minor injury it might have been a different story if i was used to this balance breaker a bit more but for me who just achieved balance breaker no its not the time to say that i can not allow buchou or any of my comrades to die i will fight till my body perishes lightning akeno san sent the lightning towards kokabiel who was concentrating on buchous attack but her lightning dissipated with a single movement of kokabiels wing will you stand in my way the one who inherited her power from baraqiel do not put me in the same group as him akeno san widened her eyes and got enraged she continued to use lightning but they were all deflected by kokabiels wings baraqiel is the leader of the fallen angels a thunder user who has the alias holy lightning in terms of basic fighting ability he is said to be on par with the viceroy of the fallen angels azazel and baraqiel is akeno sans kokabiel laughed loudly after nullifying buchous attack completely for you to become a devil hahaha you have pleasant servants rias gremory sekiryuutei the left over
of the holy sword project who reached balance breaker and the daughter of baraqiel you have weird tastes just like your brother i wont forgive you for insult ing my brotherour maou more than that the insults you made to my servants will require your life kokabiel laughed with his nose at buchous anger he then said provokingly then try to destroy me maous sister the owner of welsh dragon crimson haired ruin princess the one whom you are up against is someone who has been an arch enemy of the devils since a long time ago if you dont see this as a chance then your reputation will be looked down on kokabiel i dont know how much my holy demonic sword can go against him but i have to do it step it seemed like xenovia who was behind me moved when she went past me she muttered we will attack at the same time after hearing that i also moved ahead i put strength into my sword and went on slashing at kokabiel with xenovia the one who slashed at him was xenovia kokabiel created a sword of light with his hand and blocked her using one
hand with it hmph durandal huh unlike the excalibur that was already broken once that light is the real thing buuuuut boooooom the air shook and there was a buzzing in my ears kokabiel emitted an air wave from his other hand and made xenovias body float then kokabiel kicked xenovias stomach gaa xenovia flew back with an anguished cry it depends on the wielder girl you still cant control durandal the previous wielder was someone who had unrivaled strength xenovia adjusted her stance in the air and landed on the ground she then went on slashing towards him once again i also continued slashing towards him at the same time104 high school dxd volume 3 kokabiel i will eliminate you with my holy demonic sword im not allowed to lose anyone any more ho attacks at the same time from a holy sword and a holy demonic sword interesting good indeed come yo u cant defeat me unless you do that much kokabiel created another sword of light with his other hand and clashed with our swords my holy demonic sword xenovias durandal he was taking on our attacks as if it was nothing ku even in terms of
swords kokabiel was above us there koneko chan thrust her punch from behind him nave his black wings turned into sharp blades and cut up koneko chans body her body fell down to the ground while blood came out of her body koneko chan hey looking away while fighting will easily get you killed i let my guard down because of the damage koneko chan took and kokabiels sword of light came at me giiiin wha a crack appeared on my holy demonic sword ku the strength of the solidness depended on my thinking if i lost my concentration for a moment then for that period of time the hardness of my sword will go down as well he grasped into that slight instant don xenovia and i were helpless against the shockwave created by kokabiels body whic h sent us flying i somehow fixed my stance but xenovia and i were breathing hard we cant win thats what went through my mind the power difference between us is absolute even though i reached balance breaker there is still this much difference the leader of the fallen angels hes this strong no i have to put that thought aside we
have to win we cant survive unless we win i will win and live on asia san and ise kun went to koneko chans side asia sans sacred gear activated and started to heal koneko chans wounds thats a relief with this koneko chans life will be safe kokabiel its not over yet i put strength into my holy demonic sword and stood up again the crack on my sword disappeared and i went forward slashing towards hi m with no flaws hahaha you still come at me all right come holy demonic sword zan i surrounded the fallen angel by making swords covered with holy and demonic aura with this i made my opponent stuck in that position the only thing left was to attack then you think youve captured me with this the 10 wings of kokabiel who was smirking started to become like swords and began breaking the swords around with ease ku it didnt work i went forward slashing at him from the front but the fall en angel didnt flinch at all and he stopped my holy demonic sword with just two fingers is this it kokabiel sighed my holy demonic sword that had been
stopped couldnt be moved at all i created another holy demonic sword but that was also stopped w ith his other two fingers its not over yet i105 high school dxd volume 3 opened my mouth wide and imagined to create a holy demonic sword around my mouth the third one i held the grip with my teeth and moved my neck to the side roughly it seemed like he didnt think of the third strike he let go of my swords and stepped back did he receive damage from that attack just then when i checked kokabiel there was a single scratch on his cheek there was a bit of blood coming out of it even with that attack i could only give hi m that much damage so this was the power of one of the top echelons of fallen angels everyone here was making expressions of despair and breathed violently only kokabiel who was at an advantage was smirking but seeing that even after losing the mast ers you serve you devils and followers of god can still fight huh suddenly kokabiel spoke what was he trying to say what do you mean buchou asked with doubt
kokabiel started laughing aloud as if he found it truly amusing fuhaha fuhahahahahahahahahaha thats right i totally forgot the truth wasnt revealed to you lower guys then i will tell you in the war between the three sides not only did the four great satans die but so did god wh what what did he just say everyone her e was shocked and couldnt believe what he just said its normal for you guys to not know about it who can say that god has died humans are an incomplete bunch without god they can not control their hearts and obey the laws you know even us the fal lenangels and devils couldnt tell this to those below us you wont know where the information about god will be leaked from even among the three powers only the people at the top and certain people know about it though it seems valper noticed it ear lier god didnt exist any more nothat couldnt be it was impossible then what did we believe in while living in that institute after the war what was left were the angels who had lost their god the devils that lost their maou and the
majority of high class devils and the fallen angels who lost most of the fallen angels apart from the leaders so it wasnt a mere exhausted state all of the factions fell so low that they had to rely on humans to continue their generations especially the angels and fallen angels that could only continue their generation by mating with humans fallen angels can increase if the angels fall but pure angels cant increase their numbers after losing god even pure devils are rare right liesits a lie slightly further away from me xenovia seemed like she started losing strength she had a panicked expression that was too unbearable to look at the active believer gods servant a person who lived by serving god as her mission if the existence of g od was rejected and she lost the means to live it would be natural to become like that even i i would be biting my lips thinking what my life meant the truth is that another big war wouldnt happen unless you do it on purpose it means that all threesides went through hell in the past war everyone decided that it was meaningless to continue having a
war if the start of it all god and the maou were dead even that bastard azazel declared that there is no second war after losing the majority of hi s men in the war its hard to bear it truly is hard to bear to lower your gun once you already shot it dont fuck around dont fuck around if we continued on from there we could have won even so he is there any value in fallen angels who can only live by inviting humans who possess sacred gears kokabiel declared his argument strongly his face was expressing anger the real truth made an impact on us more than we thought asia san covered her mouth with her hands opened her eyes wide and her whole body shook even if she turned into a devil her belief didnt disappear god doesnt exist godis dead then the love we were given by him is kokabiel answered asia sans doubt with a laugh106 high school dxd volume 3 thats right its normal that there is no love from god and no divine protection from him god is gone already michael is certainly doing well hes taking the place of god
and is taking care of the angels and humans well if the system used by god is operating then the prayer to god the ble ssing of god and exorcism would function but if you compare it to the time god was present the number of believers decreased that holy demonic sword brat over there was able to create the holy demonic sword because the balance between god and the maou broke in reality holy and demonic powers can not merge if the ones who rule the power of holy and demonic powers god and the maous disappear then lots of unique phenomena occur then the reason why my holy demonic sword was created was no coincidence it turned out like that because god didnt exist any more what sarcasm hearing kokabiels words asia san dropped onto the floor asia pull yourself together asia isekun held her and called out to her it wasnt weird for her to get shocked the majority of her life involved serving god she sacrificed her life because she thought god existed a lot of things must be happening inside her even if i did rebel against god the majority of my life also involved
believing in god even my comrades i felt complicated ignoring us kokabiel put his fist up in the air from here on out i will start a war i will take your heads as a gift even if its only me i will continue from where we left off im going to show sirzechs and michael that we the fallen angels are the ultimate beings lucifer michael both of them were enormous existences as recorded in the bible kokabiel was trying to take on something like that he had that much power we were trying to fight someone like that we couldnt win he was totally in a different league from us his motives were totally beyond us he was someone who we shouldnt have tried to take on in the first place even so i tried to go towards him after griping onto my sword but there was a bright red light that came into my sight it was ise kun dont mess around i cant let you destroy my town my comrades buchou and asia just for your selfish motives and im going to become a harem king i would be troubled if you get in my way
you might be tr ying to look cool but thats not it ise kun kukuku harem king is that what the sekiryuutei desires then do you want to come with me you can become a harem king right away i will snatch beauties as we walk past you can make love to them as much as you want isekun froze there on the spot while trying to make a cool posture ii wont be deceived by sweet words like that whwhat was that pause just now no it cant be ise kun ise geez wipe your drool why are you like that ev en in a situation like this buchou also got angry of course what are you doing ise kun so sorry it seems like im really weak against the word harem if you like girls that much then i will do a lot of things for you after we return home al ive are you serious th then even sucking on oppai yes if you can win against that then its a cheap bargain flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaash the jewel on the boosted gear glowed brighter than before fufufu suck i can suck it i can suck them107 high school dxd
volume 3 isekun started smirking right now i can even punch god ah god doesnt exist any more hahahaha an intense red light that made me blink i could feel an enormous power coming from his sacred gear yooooooooooooooooshaaaaaaaa im going to beat you down to suck buchous nipples kokabiel with a reason like that the sacred gear increased the power by answering the thoughts of the possessor the boosted gear responded to ise kuns lecherous thoughts and was trying to release its power was that serious ly okay welsh dragon buchou also had red cheeks and seemed embarrassed because he said it loudly i truly felt sorry for her its the first time i saw a sekiryuutei who releases its power just by the mere thought of sucking a womans nipples wh at are you who are you kokabiel asked while narrowing his eyes ise kun said it up front with his chest put forward im the pawn of rias gremorys group hyoudou issei remember that kokabiel im the possessor of a boosted gear that lives with ero thoughts and my hot blood until a moment ago this area was filled with despair but after hearing ise kuns shout
it mysteriously gave me energy it truly was absurd since i got involved with ise kun i started to get strength from weird places i wa s not a hot blooded character but that was also okay buchou akeno san asia san and koneko chan who were supposed to be injured but everyone made a stance against kokabiel we could fight we still hadnt lost yes it was not like we couldnt win yet everyones feelings became one then fufufu interesting the sudden voice came from the sky it was not from anyone here the first one to realise it was vice president akeno san who was strong at reading different kinds of energy flow she suddenly looked up the next one to realise it was buchou both of them looked up to the dark sky at the same time i was in doubt but i soon realised it after that shivers an unknown fear and nervousness ran throughout my whole body that thing fell from the sky while overwhelming us with its presence and the power difference which made me despair flash it descended while cutting the abyss sky by sending out a white light if it came down
at that velocity it would shake the ground and make a crater it would spread dust for sure but that didnt happen there was a white thing in our sights a white thing was glowing which didnt even have a slight shadow in this dark night it was floating off the ground by an inch a white plated armour there were jewel s across various locations on the armour it also had armour on the face so we couldnt see the expression of this person the eight wings of light growing from the back were giving out a divine glow in the dark night but i was familiar with the person covered in white armour it had a different shape and colour but it was similar it was identical to the boosted gear scale mail possibly everyone aside from me who was at that place at that time must have thought the same thing so all of us understood at the same time we understood what the thing in front of us was vanishing dragon the first one to say that was the leader of the fallen angels kokabiel just as i thought the one opposite to the welsh dragon
the vanishing dragon my whole body trembled the feeling of my heart being grasped by it stopped me from moving at the same time i was fascinated by the white appearance that emitted a mysterious light beautiful my heart was taken by it instantly kokabiel made a sound with his tongue by the presence of the white armour108 high school dxd volume 3 one of the longinus divine dividing if you are already in armour mode it means that its in the balance breaker state divine dividing scale mail just like the boosted gear it truly is an annoying thing vanishing dragon in balance breaker form so you were attracted to the red vanishing dragon if you get in my wa before kokabiel finished his sentence his black wing went up into the air then there was blood coming out of him its like t he wing of a crow it has a disgusting colour to it azazels wing is much darker and has the colour of everlasting darkness you know i couldnt catch his movement with my eyes i was certain that a white object attacked kokabiel the vanishing dragon had a black wing in his hand from his
voice was the vanishing dragon a young man yyou my wing kokabiel became enraged because his wing was plucked off but the vanishing dragon laughed quietly its a symbol that you have fallen theres no need for wings for those who stooped down even below the earth right are you still planning to fly vanishing dragon are you opposing me kokabiel created countless number of spears of light in the sky but vanishing dragon wasnt intimidated by it and said clearly my name is albion divide i heard the sound and the aura around kokabiel got reduced immediately half of the spears of light in the sky also vanished one of the abilities of my divine dividing it halves the power of those i touch ever y 10 seconds your power will become my power you dont have time if you dont defeat me quickly you will become so weak that you cant even beat a human just like in the legend the ability of the sekiryuutei 8 doubles the power of the possessor and can transfer it to others the ability of the hakuryuukou9 takes the power of their opponents and make it theirs with the remaining wings kokabiel
tried to go towards the vanishing dragon albion but he couldnt catch him because he wasnt able to keep up with the movements that c ould be said to be as fast as the speed of light then one of the echelons of the fallen angels who was overwhelming us was being played around with divide damn you he tried to attack albion with a spear of light and a sword of light but the hakury uukou swung his arm to the side and vaporised them while kokabiel was having a hard time fighting his powers were getting halved divide after a few sounds kokabiels movement fell so low that even i could take him on with ease albion sighed already the power of a middle level fallen angel huh boring i thought i could have a bit more fun albion disappeared from my sight and went towards kokabiel while creating tracks of light thrust109 high school dxd volume 3 albions fist went deep into kokabiels stomach k okabiels body bent a lot and he vomited on the ground he didnt even have a trace left of the overwhelming opponent from before iimpossible me what you said a common phrase
of a grunt impossible me whats after that this cant be is it albion laughed as if he found it truly amusing i was told by azazel to take you back even if by force you acted a bit too much you so thats how it is azazel azazeeeeel i i thrust albions punch hit kokabiels face slip kokabiel crum bled down and fell onto the ground the fallen angel who had 10 wings went down albion put the defeated kokabiel on his shoulder looks like i have to carry freed as well there are things i need to ask him we will deal with him after that albion wal ked to freed who was on the ground and carried him with his arm he then tried to fly up while spreading his wings of light after retrieving the two are you ignoring me huh white one a voice i heard for the first time the voice came from ise kun hi s gauntlet was glowing so you were awake red one albions armour jewel was also glowing white were the ones residing in the jewels communicating we finally met but in a situation like this thats all right its
our destiny to fight one day things like this happen but white one i cant feel the hostility from you like before red one your hostility is incredibly low as well looks like both of us have things that interest us more than fighting thats how it is we should be having f un by ourselves for a while its not bad like this sometimes right lets meet again ddraig that would also be fun huh see you then albion the conversation was between the sekiryuutei and hakuryuukou both of them gave a farewell but isekun st epped up and seemed unsatisfied hey whats the meaning of this who are you and what are you doing because of you i cant suck buchous nipples isekun made an angry face hey hey was that the part you were mad at the possessor of the vanishing dragon left saying such a thing you need strength to understand everything get stronger my rival kun i will fight you one day he turned into a white light and flew up everyone became speechless at the outcome no one had predicted the magic circle of destruction that kokabiel spread had already disappeared it finished even
if someone intruded this town was saved then the corpse of valper got into my sight maybe it hadnt ended yet because there was someone who took over his research at the110 high school dxd volume 3 vatican headquarters when i confront that person what will i do with this holy demonic sword i still dont know but now yes just for now knock someone hit my head when i turned around it was ise kun who smiled you did it casanov a hmmm so thats a holy demonic sword it looks beautiful since the white and black thing is mixed he was looking at my holy demonic sword with interested eyes isekun i well lets skip the complicated stuff for now anyway we can say that it ended for now right also the thing about your comrades yeah thank you ise kun you thought and acted for someone like me kiba san we can do club activities together again yes asiasan asked me with a worried face she was worried about me even though she should be having a hard time after the existence of god was rejected i really thought that she was truly a kind girl when
i was about to say im okay yuuto buchou called my name buchou welcomed me with a smile yuuto im glad you returned also to reach balance breaker i am proud buchou i to everyone in the club most of all i betrayed you who saved my life once i cant find the words to express my apology buchous hand patted my cheek buchou always comforts me l ike this but you have returned that is enough you cant waste the feelings of your comrades buchou i will promise you once again i kiba yuuto will protect you and my comrades for the rest of my life as the knight of rias gremorys group ufufufu thank you but you cant say that in front of ise okay when i looked ise kun was glaring at me with eyes filled with jealousy i also want to protect buchou by becoming a knight but there isnt anyone who can become buchous knight other t han you so take responsibility and finish that task he said it with a shy face yeah i know ise kun now vooom buchous hand was covered in a red aura making a dangerous sound ummm whats happening
buchou buchou smiled at me while i was in doubt yuuto its a punishment for acting by yourself 1000 spanks the reinforcements from the maou arrived thirty minutes after everything ended during that time i was spanked while ise kun laughed on the ground it was really painful but it felt like i really came back111 high school dxd volume 3 new life a few days after the incident with kokabiel asia and i who came into the club room were shocked at seeing a foreign girl sitting on the sofa hey sekiryuutei the girl with the green mesh xenovia is there wearing k uou academys girls uniform whwhy are you here i couldnt hide my unrest and pointed my finger at her pa then black wings grew out of xenovias back eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh its the wings of a devil whats the meaning of this i found out that god is gone so i turned into a devil as a self abandonment i received a knight piece from rias gremory it seems like im not that great while durandal is so i was able to become a devil with 1 piece and i was also placed in this school from now
on im a 2nd year student and also a member of the occult research club lets get along ise kun xenovia says while breathing with her nose dont make such a cute sound with a serious voice i copied irina but it looks like its not easy but reincarnating buchou is it all right to use such a valuable piece yes she has found out the truth that god doesnt exist even so thats too quick well having a durandal wielder feels reliable with this its a birth of the two swords men along with yuuto buchou seems like she is enjoying it hey is that alright but not thinking about small stuff seems like buchou but certainly having a swordsman who wields a legendary holy sword durandal feels reliable even for the rating game our opponents would be devils so the holy sword would release its fury against them the gremory group would become even stronger yes im a devil now i cant go back no maybe this was a good thing hmmm but since god is gone my life was a failur e but serving under a devil who was once my enemy is even if she is
a sister of a maou xenovia starts to hold her head down while mumbling something ah shes receiving some damage because she prayed just like asia im not in a position to say it but shes also weird by the way wheres irina why is she here and not shidou irina irina returned to headquarters along with the corpse of valper and the 5 excaliburs including mine the fragments that act as the cores were retrieved in that state so the mission of retrieving it was accomplished if they have the cores they can use alchemy to make the holy swords again kiba and xenovia destroyed the excalibur made from four of them but the fragments of the original excalibur are safe was i t alright to give them your excalibur more like was it okay for you to betray the church i have to give them the excalibur back just in case unlike the durandal there are other wielders that could be chosen having durandal is enough for me when i mentioned the absence of god to them they became silent so i became an outsider for knowing the absence of god the church hates outsiders and112 high school
dxd volume 3 heresy very much even if that person is the wielder of durandal they will cut them off exactly the same way as the incident with asia argento she laughed at herself does the church usually go that far to get rid of those people seen as heretics they are quite extreme irina was lucky even if she wasnt in the battle because of the wounds she ended up not knowing the truth she has a stronger belief than me if she found out about god i dont k now what would have happened to her the more modest the christian is the more painful it would be if they found out the truth in the worst case it means that their whole life was rejected if that happens you wont know what would happen to humans except she was really disappointed that i became a devil i couldnt tell her that it was because of the absence of god it was an awkward farewell that we had maybe we might be enemies the next time we meet xenovia said it while narrowing her eyes ho w did irina feel when she returned home buchou confirms that all
the club members are here she then says the church made contact with us devils more precisely the maou talked about this incident they said we would like to make contact with you because of unclear and dishonest actions of the fallen angels even though we feel unsatisfactory about this they also apologised about valper because it was their mistake for letting him escape in the past so they feel unsatisfied well we are enemi es anyway well maybe we should feel satisfied because at least they apologised about valper but this school is truly terrifying because theres another sister of a maou attending this school xenovia says it while making a sigh theres another sister of a maou waitis it perhaps there are only two high class devils attending this school then it would bekaichou when i looked at buchou she nods her head to confirm it hawawawawa something intense like that is true oh yeah the gym and the school ground destroyed by kokabiel was repaired by people related to a maou sama i have to admire the power of devils for fixing it in just over a night to think about it they can create a replica
of the school in another dimension it must be a piec e of cake for them but to have the support of a maou seriously whats going on with this school the truth about this incident was sent to the god side and the devils side by the viceroy of the fallen angels azazel the theft of the excalibur wa s an action taken by kokabiel only the other leaders didnt know about it he planned to break the tension between the three sides because he tried to start another war he was put in the cocytus for eternity in a frozen state buchou explained it to us then kokabiel wont be ever coming outside then thats good i dont want to see that wild guy ever again he was certainly a stupid war freak fallen angel though it ended with the intervention of vanishing dragon they stopped the rampage done by one of them by sending someone from their organization that time the vanishing dragon was already in its balance breaker form when it descended from the sky its not an incomplete one like my own a perfect balance breaker at this point i am much weaker than him
an existence that i would be facing one day hakuryuukou albion i dont know his actual name but i want to shorten the gap between us until i meet him again there would also be a meeting between the representatives of the angels devils and azazel apparently there is something azazel wants to talk about i heard that maybe azazel would be apologizing about kokabiel then though its suspicious if azazel would apologise buchou says it with disgust while she shrugged her shoulder s o the governor of the fallen angels is someone with a huge ego huh but isnt it something big that the representatives of the three sides would be gathering i dont know what they would be talking about then but it seems like it would affect the future of the world113 high school dxd volume 3 we were also invited to that meeting we have to report about the incident at the meeting because we were involved are you serious i wasnt the only one who got surprised by buchous words everyone had a shocked expression on their faces well obviously anyone would get surprised if they were told to stay in the place with the
big important people whats going to happen to our world that is ah thats right i ask xenovia something that has been bugging me the whole time the vanishing dragon belongs to the side of the fallen angels right thats right azazel is gathering sacred gear possessors who has a longinus i dont know what he is thinking but its definitely something not good the vanishing dragon is the top fighter among them i heard that he is the fourth or fifth strongest out of all the strong people there including the leaders of grigori at this point he is far stronger than you who is his rival fourth strongest thats why he was able to def eat kokabiel who we couldnt even stand up against looks like we are in a serious situation isnt it ddraig xenovia then looks at asia thats right i will apologise to asia argento since god didnt exist then his love and help didnt as well i m sorry asia argento hit me much as much as you want xenovia bows her head down the japanese way of apologizing her expression didnt change so i cant tell if she means it or not no
i dont intend to do something like that xenovia san im e njoying my current lifestyle even though im a devil now i met someone people who are important to me i am happy because of the place i live in now and the people i have met asia smiles like the virgin mary and she forgives her aaah asia is truly a good girl your brother is deeply moved her psychological state was at danger after hearing the rejection of god but because buchou and i were with her she returned to normal so only you and i are the only christians that found out about the absence of god i wont be able to say something like a divine punishment to you now so a heretic huh i was a holy sword user who was admired but now a heretic huh i cant forget about how their eyes and attitudes changed when they saw me at that mom ent it felt like i saw a glimpse of sadness in xenovias eyes then i will be leaving theres a lot of things i need to know about before transferring to this school xenovia tries to leave the room uumm
asia stops xenovia on the next weekend i m going to go out to play with everyone would you also like to join xenovia san asia says it with a smile xenovia had widened her eyes in shock and then gave a bitter smile next time then this time im not interested except except xenovia then says it with a smile to asia can you take me around the school next time yes114 high school dxd volume 3 asia also answers with a smile hmmm i hope they become friends its hard to understand her but xenovia doesnt seem like a bad person i will swear it in the name of my holy sword durandal i also would like to have a battle with the holy demonic sword user over there as well alright i wont lose next time kiba also replied with a smile after confirming that xenovia leaves the room i can feel something strong from kibas body along with confidence that time in that place that incident changed something inside him clap buchou claps her hands now since everyone has returned again lets start the club activity again yes everyone replies with an energetic voice that day

are moving by fast i was trying to stop the blood from gushing out of my nose with my fingers ara asia your skin is beautiful i am jealous nno way buchou your skin is white and the texture is smoother ufufu your words make me happy while speaking in front of me the crimson and golden haired bishoujo were standing and washing them selves covered with foam from the body soap yes buchou and asia were naked right in front of my eyes these two girls is this shangri la or is this an illusion this dreamy situation was occurring right in front of me i felt like tears would come ou t from my eyes no in reality tears were coming out i couldnt be happier than this a situation in the bath i knew that there was no god in this world but how could there not be a god there what am i thinking this is a gift from the heavens themsel ves no no this situation is a gift from maou sama wait maou sama is buchous big brother to better explain the situation when i went to the shower i met asia while she
was in the middle of undressing after apologising by saying sorry i tried to go outside ise youre going to bathe as well ara asia as well only to stumble upon buchou who was trying to enter the bath since you two seem like you want to bathe together it would be much faster if all three of us entered that was buchous unbelievable proposition and just like that we entered the bath normally this would be an impossible situation however even after i stared at their naked bodies they didnt seem to be embarrassed it was progress that was like a miracle and a dream combined together even i who had been called the incarnation of a pervert was troubled over how to handle this stroke of good luck in front of me i tried as much as possible not to stare at them in reality i wanted to see i wanted to look a t them i wanted to engrave their bodies into my eyes and brain i wanted to use them for my personal fantasies in the night however if i did that my nosebleed would keep gushing forth until the bathtub would become dyed red i
dont want suspicious thi ngs like that to happen in this situation i wanted this atmosphere to continue as much as possible even though looking at them straight in the face was a deadly poison i didnt feel that atmosphere in this bathroom i wanted this to continue as much as possible this situation is definitely precious even if i just have to hear the two girls conversation while staring at the ceiling of the bath after having made my decision i heard the voice of someone entering the changing room with a splash i h eard something entering clack weight was pressing on my body and the finest softest sensation was stimulating my skin turning my head around slowly i saw buchou inside the bathtub leaning on my body whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i i w was in the bath with girl s and to top it off i was in contact with their bodieeeeees i wanted to enter the bath with ise like this once with a smile on her face buchou was pressing her body even more uoooooh the smell of shampoo was coming out of buchous hair the touch from buchous body was too stimulating and my brain had
reached its limit uggh it couldnt catch up with this situation hey ise do you hate entering the bath with me thats not the case its the best however its also true that my body can not withstand it i am extremely happy but at this rate ill die from excessive blood loss no wait isnt that the deepest desire as a man looking at asia she seemed to be working on washing her body but sometimes she would send sharp glances towards me is asia mad just by hearing that i am happy i want to bathe with ise like this everyday as if spoiling me buchou pressed further onto me uoooh gush a bit of blood gushed out i wouldnt be able to hold it in like this but it seems like your body wont be able to withstand it everyday seems impossible how about once every three days or once every five days i wont like it if its only once a week bubuchou was selfishly trying to rewrite my schedule i felt buchou was selfish thank you very much crap since asia was here as well i couldnt make bold movements if only i was more
courageous and had a more perverted nature then i would do you want to attack me buchou spoke as if she had seen through my heart as usual it seemed l ike my thoughts were easy to read if asia wasnt here i might have been attacked it seems like during our time alone open while buchou was saying that something vigorously entered the bathtub squeeze something was embracing me i remember thi s soft sensation looking back i saw asia embracing me i hate being left out e even though i want to enter the bath together as well asia what big things you are saying uooooh i am being caressed by two girls in the bathtub help meeeee buchou s face changed into a sharp expression she raised her eyebrows get away asia since its this situation i will say it clearly this boy is mine my family and my servant hes my ise understood thats right i am buchous servant for buchou i exi st solely as a pet just as one would for a pet she puts in quite the effort though it might be that all devil girls are like this above all buchou hates
having her things touched by others she may forgive another devil for touching me on the outside but on the inside i have heard that she cant bear it especially if its a girl it goes above her limits i guess i am just part of her best collection since i possess a power beyond rare she probably wants to treat me preciously it seems like she u sed to treat me more like a pet but now it must be my imagination yeah because i want to think like that i feel that way that may be true but hes my ise san as well asia adored me as well when i was taking an afternoon nap in my room without me realising it she sneaked in and slept soundly next to me when i woke her up and told her go back to your room and sleep she said with a sleepy face carry me to my room thats how much she adores me i thought i was going to die at that time yes i carried her to her room however while i talked to other girls she would often puff out her cheeks i guess its
because she didnt want her onii chan to be taken by others in manga and anime there are characters with attitudes like that the p roblem is that its difficult for it to escalate to a love relationship well i swore to protect asia as my mission so i dont want that to happen anyway im more than happy by being spoiled like this by her ah its awesome being adored by a golden haired bishoujo upon hearing asias words buchou narrowed her eyes onee sama im scared werent they intimate friends until just a moment ago why did it have to become like this the small bathtub was becoming a war zone for the two girlsss asia its because youre normally adored by ise at least hand over these times to me i am healed just by being with ise it takes away my daily exhaustion too buchou was trying to slightly separate asia from me but asia was stubbornly clinging on to me uw aa asias boobs are soooo soooooooooft no no im holding it in too i also want to be with ise san asia shook her head sideways and hugged me tightly ah whatever no nosebleed
asia looked at me with hazy eyes as if she wanted to tell me something dont look at me with those eyes i will only want to care for you even more even though she didnt say anything buchous face twitched suddenly she took my hand and boing she placed my hand on her boobs my fingers and palm felt an extreme softness while my hand was asleep it was massaging her boobs but buchou wasnt complaining has asia done such a thing mine and ises relationship is such that we can do these things scary while speaking in a plain manner buchou was hiding thorns in her words wait buchous boobs boobs booooooobs while watching this scene asias whole body was shaking her cheeks swelled and puffed as her temper reached its limit asia also took my other hand boing she placed it on her breasts too asiaaaaaaaaa what a wonderful person you areno you are doing something that you shouldnt what a perverted girl you have become this must be buchous and akeno sans influence without a doubt even though you were such an innocent girlllll t to have grown this much isesan between mine and buchous whose
breasts are better i lose in size but i wont lose in anything else ara ise loves bigger ones he has said many times that he loves my breasts right ise while i held my hands on thei r breasts those two were sending sparks off at each other drip its impossible from within my nostrils it felt like something had ruptured drip drip drip and that was it a lot of blood was spilling out of my nostrils and the bathtub was bec oming dyed red with blood everywhere i started losing consciousnesses hey ise isesan hold on i am satisfied however my body could no longer withstand it if these girls dont remember how to stop the bleeding soon i am going to die i wan t a resourceful person part 2 the next day i was hurrying towards a client on my bicycle late in the night performing the duties of a devil i was in the middle of great work during the day my blood was low and that was problematic my life with bucho u and asia was fun but the stimulation was too much if i had been more like a playboy i would
have satisfied them both at the same time and place but those two came from worlds with different values from each other the developments during that bath mi ght have led to sex if i had laid a hand on them with sexual motives i think the household would have been destroyed and there would have been no traces of our descendants buchou likes to attend to me like she does to her servants and asia must think o f me as her familyand she adores me like an elder brother i shouldnt lay my hands on family living under one roof but abroad theyre more progressive towards matters of body relations however the stimulation is way too strong if i cant even ge t used to this then ill never be able to make a harem in this situation i wont even be able to dream of becoming a harem king the dream is still far off meh its fine right now i have to work innocently for my job if i keep doing my job my rank will increase lets first get a position ill work hard while aiming to become a high class devil right now i
am moving by bicycle but i have gotten used to the devil business like this and my service to the customers is going well too yo devil kun sorry for today as well after looking at the client i let out a sigh the client was a black haired man with a bad guy appearance looking at him i would have guessed that he was around twenty ah this person is a foreigner so i cant tell what his true age is even though he is a foreigner hes wearing a yukata meh its been hot recently i think hes a handsome guy maybe his face is more attractive than the handsome prince kibas however the atmosphere from his entire body feels like a bad guy which is definitely different from kibas but girls who like bad guys would fall for him at first sight and i am summoned by this person everyday right now i am in his room inside his mansion and the person he decided upon was me somehow he seems to like me i dont know why he likes me and even though he never has large requests he calls me everyday yesterday he made me
go buy bread in the night and before that he said lets go fishing and had me accompany him to a nearby fishin g spot and before that i dont want to remember it any more wait is it that big of a thing for you to even call a devil no our business is to fulfill human requests i shouldnt be complaining my master rias buchou would scold me and in order to fulfill my goal as harem king i would have to live through this strict business devil kun would you play a game with me i bought a racing game in the afternoon and im lonely without an opponent heeeeey its that sort of request again wait comp laining is bad yes i would love to honestly this is a good customer for contracts he gives back more than what we demand he started from a painting that looked high class then jewels and then even gold nuggets even buchou and the others were surprised thanks to him its no doubt that my value is growing as well well i guess i am thankful to him for that all right lets handle this easily today as well
and go one step further on the road to becoming harem king the client was setting up t he game oh yeah he hasnt even told me his name yet maybe ill be his favourite customer from now on as well learning his name is obvious then all right i have set up the game its great to have so many items to waste time on in japan it isnt a b ad place here take the controller ah thanks you know i am good in these types of games heh in that case its going to be fun i am a beginner so please go lightly on me yes i am good at racing games top speed legend ise i have played at every game centre fufufu ill show him the power that i honed in the war zone known as the game centre go and although i started off well my lead began to fall short as the race continued in the beginning i had developed my overwhelming advantage but i briefly remember now i should be catching up to you soon what crap was he sprouting while thinking that uoooh no way my car was slowly being
surpassed what an unbelievable situation to be beaten like this by a beginner win he e asily made it to the goal he must have been a master in short races it seems like its my victory devil kun not yet oh your fighting spirit seems to be growing want to do another race hm devil kunno red dragon emperor eh j just n ow what did he say just now upon hearing the words that came out of the mans mouth a chill went down my whole body this guy who the hell is he why does he know that hes not human i swallowed and fearfully asked him who are you the man only opened his mouth a bit while watching the tv he revealed i am azazel leader of the fallen angels nice to meet you red dragon emperor hyoudou issei win far away from the goal the mans car easily caught up with my stopped car and we nt past the goal while in his second lap at that instant twelve jet black wings expanded from the mans back life 1 its summer its swimsuits i am in trouble part 1 this isnt a joke the
crimson haired bishoujo sama had her eyebrows raised with an angry expression on her face rias gremory buchou she is my master and a high class devil onee sama at school she is the president of the occult research club she is a very strict yet also very kind person shes just what i longed for and that bishoujo sama that i longed for was giving me a lap pillow as usual buchous lap pillow was soft and it made me emotional just like before by the way we have changed into our summer uniforms and theyre short sleeved it is a wonderful s eason when we are lightly dressed indeed even though it was decided that the meeting of the leaders of the devils angels and fallen angels would be held in this town to think that the governor of the fallen angels would suddenly intrude in my territor y and interfere with our business buchou was trembling with rage ooh she was scary a few days earlier because of the event that occurred in this city between devils angels and fallen angels the relations between the three factions had been aff ected to a certain extent as a
result the leading members of each faction would gather together and discuss the future we got involved in that incidentand to top it off we would have to be present at that meeting and report on the details of the inc ident before the meeting date azazel suddenly contacted us yes he too was my contract client he hid his identity and presence when he came into contact with us its correct to say that it was an interference in other peoples business not to mention since it was the governor of the fallen angels the topic escalated to an entirely different level it wouldnt end with it being just mischief however buchous family seemed like they werent bothered by the event and to top it off to try and lay a hand on my cute ise the price is death i had heard that azazel was extremely interested in sacred gears its definitely because my ise possesses the boosted gear that he came in contact with us its going to be all right ise i will definitely prot ect you ise buchou said that while patting my head buchou was a high class devil that adored her servants and
treated them as a part of her family she hated for her possessions to be touched or hurt by others especially because buchou treats me quite adorably she is overly sensitive towards that sort of story im happy but its kind of complicated because i yearn for buchou but buchou probably doesnt think about me the same way its a master servant relationship between devils right the ow ner and the dog haa if buchou gets a boyfriend then shell probably lose interest in me and throw me away if i dont become a harem king before that ill be lonely it seems like azazel is eyeing my sacred gear after all hes the governor of the fallen angels right i let my worries out if i was caught by azazel what would happen to me i was scared beyond my imagination after hearing about my worries the other male member of the club the handsome prince kiba opened his mouth i heard from someone that azazel has deep knowledge about sacred gears i also heard that hes gathering capable sacred gear holders but its going to be all right as he continued kiba looked at me as if he
was going to lose me i will protect you kiba that feels disgusting no um i am happy buthow should i put this if i hear such things from a man with a straight face then ill be troubled on how to respond its obvious that ill say that with a straight face you saved me youre my pr ecious comrade if i cant save a comrade from a crisis then i cant call myself a knight of the gremory household yeah i understand that butyou know your tone isnt supposed to be used towards a comrade a friend and not to mention the male me i ts obvious you should say that to a heroine without caring about that kiba continues theres no problem my sacred gear that attained balance breaker and ise kuns boosted gear if we combine these two then i feel we can overcome even a dangerous cri sis fufu i wasnt the type to say such things before after hanging out with you my readiness for comrades also changed as well but i dont know why i dont dislike that its hot around my chest region ddisgusting youdont come near me dont touch me seriously
leave me alone you and i are just going to keep spreading around indecent rumours among a particular group of girls if you keep going on like this i dont want to be any more involved with you and the development of bl1 and anyways this guy after the issue with the invasion of the fallen angel leader was resolved his attitude towards me has been weird what do you plan on doing by sweetening me do that with your clients nno way ise kun you sure get down easily unnecessary feelings are bad for you and why do you really want to be here however i wonder what happened besides not knowing their move ments its difficult to move here as well the other side is the governor of the fallen angels we cant even make contact with him buchou was pondering we couldnt let the relationship between devils and fallen angels deteriorate any further on our wh ims since buchou was quite strict about that topic if there was no big movement from their side then we wouldnt move as well azazel has always been like that rias suddenly we heard a voice that belonged to nobody among
us everybody looked at the direction the voice came from and sawa crimson haired male smiling pleasantly i remember this face wait akeno san and the others were kneeling in their places asia and i were the only ones having trouble coping with the situation the newcomer xen ovia had a confused expression as well bam ouch while dropping my head buchou stood up ooooniisama she let out a surprised voice yes he is buchous onii sama and the current maou of the devil society sirzechs lucifer sama hes that person ooh to meet maou sama again at a place like this azazel wont do anything like kokabiel did a few days ago he may do a prank like last time though the governor has come earlier than the planned date that was what maou sama said behind maou sama there was the silver haired maid grayfia san as well it was obvious since shes maou samas queen i like akeno san and the others also hurriedly kneeled down after looking at my action asia also copied it please relax i came for private busine ss today raise your heads its okay to not be so respectful that was what
his words implied everyone obeyed that and stood up hey my little sister this room seems like a murder scene i wonder how its possible for this place to be full of magic c ircles even though young girls gather here while surveying the room maou sama was giving a bitter smile meh it was indeed true i got used to it but this was a really weird room after all onii sama w why are you here buchou asked doubtfully wel l that was a given it was not really possible for the maou sama who carried the weight of devil society on his shoulders to show up in the human world in a schools club room after she said that maou sama handed over a unfilled printed form what ar e you saying classroom visits are coming soon right i am also thinking of participating by all means i want to see my little sister working hard in her studies from up close ah now that you mention it the schools visit was really close my father was also in high spirits so much that he was even planning on taking a paid leave to come visit whatever
he seemed to want to see asias class life more than mine after getting a daughter my parents had been making a ruckus like its a festival every time something occured grayfia right youre the one who told onii sama grayfia san responds to the troubled looking buchou immediately yes the reports from the school come to me who has been entrusted with the schedule of the gremory household of course i am sirzechs samas queen as well thus i reported it to my master after hearing that buchou sighed huh buchou isnt interested in the class visit does she dislike her family coming to look at her even if my maou duties are hard even i f i have to take a day off from my work i wanted to participate in my little sisters class visit dont worry otou ue2 will come over as well oooh buchous otou san as well i had looked at his face once before in the previous engagement party when i jumped in he seemed like a dandy devil tthats not true isnt onii sama the maou to leave your job and come here the maou cant treat a single devil in a
special way i see since buchous onii san is the maou no matter if they are blood relatives she couldnt accept receiving special treatment however maou sama turned his head sideways no no this is my work as well rias actuall y i thought about conducting the conference between the three factions in this school i came to inspect the meeting place wwwhaaaat seriously i couldnt hide my surprise no not only me everyone looked shocked youll do it here youll hold the meeting between devils angels and fallen angels here in this school here really buchous eyes were wide open as well well if you heard that youd want to confirm it once more ah this school somehow seems to have fate tied to it you my lit tle sister the legendary sekiryuutei the holy demonic sword user the holy sword durandals wielder and maou serafall leviathans little sister are attached to this place kokabiel and the hakuryuukou also attacked this place this is a phenomenon you ca nt label as coincidence strong powers keep mixing in its like wave motion i think the person accelerating this wave motion is hyoudou issei kun the sekiryuutei sirzechs sama glanced at
me if maou sama looked at me then id get nervous are you the maou nice to meet you i am the one called xenovia the one who intervened in the conversation is the girl with a green fringe on her hair the newcomer devil xenovia at first glance shes a real beauty but shes not just all looks shes the wi elder of the legendary holy sword durandal buchous newest family member and her other knight good day to you xenovia i am sirzechs lucifer i got the report from rias the wielder of the holy sword durandal got reincarnated as a devil not to mentio n becoming my sisters family truth be told i doubted my ears when i heard it the first time i also didnt think that i would become a devil to be reincarnated into the side i kept on killing even if i say so myself i sometimes regret it as it wa s quite a bold move yeah thats it why did i become a devil desperation however at that time truthfully anything was fine but was it really fine to become a devil ah shes once again thinking deeply with her head
in her arms this girl says bold things but she ends up regretting them later on shes a hard to understand girl like always hahaha its great that my little sisters family has a lot of interesting people xenovia since you were just reincarnated you wont understand yo ur own way but i want you to support the gremory household as rias family ill be counting on you if i am asked by the legendary maou written in the bible to do it then ill have no choice but to do it i dont know how much ill be able to do but allow me to do whatever i can in my capability after hearing xenovias words maou sama smiles that smile was exactly the same as buchous thanks after hearing maou samas thanks xenovias cheeks also became a bit red now then lets continue the difficult conversation somewhere else hm however even though i came to the human world its nighttime would a lodging institution be open right now what would a lodging institution be it may be open but it would take time to search for such a thing hm thenthe thing i was thinking in my mind
i raised my hand and said it ah if thats the case then part 2 i see i am relieved that my sister hasnt been causing you any trouble no way onii san rias san is a really good girl yes rias san is such a wonderful girl that ise doesnt deserve her in my houses living room the legendary maou sama and my parents were exchanging greetings buchou was beside maou sama behind him was grayfia san waiting on standby during our meeting at the club room i gave a suggestion if thats the case would you like to stay in my housewas what i said at first maou sama was circling his eyes but maybe after remembering that buchou was living in my house he said thats fine with me i w anted to greet the couple whose place my sister is boarding in and readily consented buchou resisted cutely by saying no no but theres no way you could stop both maou sama and grayfia san after the devil business was completed we came here to the hyoudou household your red face is so cute you would naturally be scared of what your brother whos also the
maou would say for the time being regarding sirzechs samas personal info we made it that hes buchous onii san and the heir to the compan y buchous father runs hes sirzechs gremory after using the name he threw away long ago once more sirzechs sama seemed to be having fun the maid san over there is yes shes grayfia maou sama answers my fathers question actually shes my wife eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh everyone except buchou let out gasps but grayfia san was expressionlessly pinching maou samas cheek i am the maid grayfia i apologise for my master speaking such boring jokes it huwts it huwts grayfia the angry yet quiet grayfia san and the teary eyed smiling maou sama buchou who was beside them covered her face with her hands from embarrassment ah buchous family seems to be interesting who would have thought that the maou sama would say joke s like this since grayfia san seems to be accustomed to this as well maou sama must be doing mischief frequently well then gremory san will you be attending the class visit as well mother asks maou sama without shame her cheeks were dyed red mot her were you fascinated by
maou samas beautiful face well its a given since hes buchous male version so he would be cool i cant say anything after seeing him rubbing his cheek where he was pinched yes i have taken a break from work so i tho ught i could use this chance to see my little sisters school and also how she looks in class on the day of the visit my father should be coming as well ah rias sans otou san as well father helped in the establishment of kuoh academy like me i t seems this was a good chance for him to come visit as well although frankly speaking i think he just wanted to see riass face gremory san would you like some sake we have some delicious sake of japan otou san brought out a treasure bottle likesake from the kitchen heey otou san suddenly taking out the sake isnt that rude however in response to my anxieties maou sama let out a smile that is excellent lets drink it by all means since japanese alcohol goes down well with a capable mouth3 maou sama was much friendlier than you would imagine part 3 nno way i
cant sleep together with ise the fun party was over and it was time to sleep in front of my room buchou was approaching maou sama with a strict face i wanted to talk with him a bit while being on the bed sorry rias but just for tonight lend me hyoudou isseikun i see maou sama wanted to sleep while tal king with me hes already placed the futon for guests in the room buchou slept with me every night in my bed she seemed to be completely sad from not being able to sleep with me yeah its like her love to her servant ended here it seems like its mea n to buchou like a little girls stuffed doll which she uses when sleeping gets taken its too cute theres something akeno san said to me it seemed buchous degree of dependence towards me was increasing by the day she said im really cute to her ho wever on the other hand i was scared whether i would be able to answer her expectations or not by the way even now i was sleeping with buchou and asia together every night we slept like the kanji for
river4 but you know if we three sleep together every time strangely i become relieved i understood it as husband and wife always sleep together if i had an elder and a younger sister wo uld it be like this i get used by buchou as a hugging pillow asia not wanting to be defeated hugged me as well i have been making wonderful memories every night butit hasnt developed beyond that maybe because it feels like its family love buc hou said that she has an illness that if she didnt sleep with me shed die asia said that if she doesnt have me by her side like usual she gets sad and hates it does hugging me feel good that reminds me recently matsuda told me this while sheddin g tears i smell asia chans scent from ise whats the meaning of this well thats a given because we sleep together everyday its not strange even if i give out asias scent i replied ambiguously to that but wouldnt strange rumours spread among some boys fufufu no doubt the boys from my class think i have graduated f rom my virginity its best that you think that it
isnt bad that they think that though i havent been able to graduate if this was kiba or some other guy would they have already slept with buchou no no thats not true even though its this wonder ful situation there is a proper order for things for me to skip the order and attack buchou is if you look at it from a guts perspective youre not the sekiryuutei but rather the red virgin emperor partner suddenly the one who says that is ddra ig shut up leave me alone in the meantime i will do ecchi things with buchou and you just keep on looking from there ise the one who hugs me is buchou uoooooh i am happy but i am seriously embarrassed to do this in front of two people at sch ool shes the cold and cool buchou but recently at home shes like this she resembles an office lady who can accomplish anything calmly but when she goes back home she becomes like a kid in front of her pet can you sleep alone are you alright with me not being beside you i am not alright though just you not being beside me
ojou sama lets return back to our room now i will be there in your room as well well then sirzechs sama good night grayfia san took away buchou who was saying som ething buchou went away from my body i know grayfia buchous shape seems as if shes regretting it that scene looks like a scene where the parent and child have to get separated ah um ise san good night i also think its unfortunate but ton ight ill sleep in my room slightly bowing her head asia headed off towards her room while keeping her smile on the only two left were me and maou sama now shall we enter inside yyes just by him entering my room i was nervous maou samas po sture was elegant and the aura surrounding devils was quiet around him but even an amateur like me could sense the terrifying concentration of magic power in my skin probably just by concentrating a bit of his power i would be reduced to dust but i cou ld feel his splendour because this person is at the top of the devils world we could continue on our devil jobs with peace like usual
this is the maou just by inhaling the same air as him you could tell that he was in an entirely different class w hile i was trying to prepare myself to sleep together with him while having never had a proper conversation before the lights were switched off and i was beside him i heard you met azazel maou sama said that to me yes i acknowledged that obedie ntly i hear he did nothing to you but did he say something to you ill meet you again next time is what he said i see azazel has a strong interest in sacred gears your boosted gear is no exception actually same as you people possessin g longinus have gathered alongside him for what purpose i dont know that but azazel is the governor of an organisation with the power to affect heaven underworld and the human world if he uses that it will cause a great amount of disturbance however he doesnt like war like kokabiel does its because of that that the fallen angels were the first to withdraw from the great war of the past yeah to be honest i dont want to have another owner
other than buchou i mean i cant even go to t hat place if i get forcibly brainwashed then what will i do as if realising my concern maou sama speaks in an enjoyable tone dont worry i guarantee your safety finally the legendary dragon came to the devil side so ill have them give you a go od treatment and also my little sister treats you dearly ive never seen rias having so much fun even in the underworld i am sure she must be having fun every day i feel that this is thanks to you this person must really care for buchou from his heart i felt his words just now were overflowing with deep affection hyoudou issei kun take care of my sister of rias from now on too yes thats obvious maou sama i will protect buchou from now on as well always even if i become alone it wont change the fact that i am buchous family even if i become the harem king if buchou gets in trouble i will come rushing to her aid ino i am buchousrias gremory samas pawn5 thanks oh yeah hyoudou issei kun is it all right for
me to call you ise kun like my little sister does oof course its an honor i see then ise kun wont you call me by my name onii san is fine as well ooniisan w what are you thinking are you my onii san i dont get it but i think its a very high honour i feel its rude after all would calling you sirzechs sama be alright then lets do it that way yeah however its a pity i wanted to be called onii san by the legendary dragon meh it will become that before long so it should be fine with this for now hhuh it seemed like sirzechs sama somehow came to a self conclusion i didnt get what he was thinking about but since hes the maou sama it should be a high level anguish by the way ise kun yyes the boosted gear can transfer the increased power to someone else yes thats true the topics different but you seem to like the big breasts of girls ri ght yes i love them ah i affirmed it in a loud voice in front of sirzechs sama what a rude thing i am so
embarrassed however i sure am obedient to my desires even as her brother i think that riass breasts are bountiful yes i feel that bu chousmasters breasts are the best oniisan buchous boobs are the best they really are the best thank you very much for raising them up im giving thanks from my side as well this is a what if question butif you transfer your increased po wer from your boosted gear to riass breasts what would happen meh dont worry about it that moment a shock never before felt in me was born use boosted gear on bu buchous boobs no way that thingis possible no but that conc ept wasnt present gift to boobs to transfer the power of the sekiryuutei on boobs th that is what exactly would happen if that occurred i cant imagine it i cant predict it damn it maou samas thought level is far above mine what conceptualising power would the size simply increase it cant be that beautiful pair would be able to even wrap around national treasure level items no no would they shine while stretched uhhhhh i dont know my brain was howling as if my expanding thoughts
we re raging over here ill rotate my head so much that itll be the largest rotation done in recent times both of my hands fingers were twitching unconsciously facing the sky like they were squeezing boobs m my eyes are becoming clear not good i can t sleep i cant sleep if i used gift to buchous breasts what would happen good night ise kun while sirzechs sama went to sleep beside me i was endeavouring the whole night with my delusions without getting an answer part 4 several days after sirzechs samas visit sirzechs sama and grayfia san left my house the day after they stayed over at my place it seems like they are investigating the city but if you look at it from my perspective as one who attended to sirzechs sama for several days y ou could only think of it as sightseeing no since its maou sama no doubt hes perceiving things from a point of view i could never imagine he competed with me in game centres seems like he wants to establish game centres in the underworld we test ed out all the flavours at the hamburger shop he said he wanted
to open chains of restaurants in the underworld and we went to the shinto shrine with maou samas absolute demonic power the shrines holy power was driven away so we could go inside maou sama is capable of anything even though it seemed his actions were all travel and enjoyment at first glance i feel he was serious in everything i was a devil lacking in training to even think of that by the way if i gave the gift to buchous b oobs then what would happen i havent got an answer to that yet might as well ask her no i cant ask for that buchou can i use boosted gear on your boobs idiooooooooooot you cant say this stupid line but it bothers me what will really happe n buchous boobs while thinking that since the morning the holiday became a work day were leaving we three went to school from the house today is a holiday but because there was something to do we headed towards the school guuh this was the most awaited day of all days ah my heart is dancing my hearts beating loudly drip drip drip my drool drops kept coming out
one after another a person called to me who had a lowly smile on his face morning the one meeting us in between was xen ovia she was living alone in an apartment near my house she who became a devil because of various circumstances didnt want to go back to the land of the vatican for that purpose she started living in this city but it seems like she didnt like slee ping in the old school building so she rented an apartment although that apartment also has an aura of devils exuding from it she lived in our neighbourhood because her master buchou and the same as her asia both live in my house if there was somet hing she didnt understand while living there she could come to our house easily since its close by meh if she suddenly started living in a different culture and living standard there were a lot of things she wouldnt understand oh yeah asia and xen ovia were both surprised at the opening of umbrellas during rainy days it seemed like they dont open their umbrellas even on rainy days over there after looking at the vinyl umbrellas and getting extremely
scared the impression would be deep really t heir culture is different asia were you able to finish last nights homework yes what about you xenovia san well i dont know some things that are in japanese would you teach me yes please leave it to me but kanji are still a bit me too its really scary that the japanese learn these complex characters i am catching a glimpse of a part of a major economic power the two chatting were asia and xenovia when they met initially it was really bad but somehow the fact that these two were disciples of christianity was probably the main reason their relationship deepened the quiet asia and the energetic xenovia are the names the boys use to call the two foreign bishoujos i see this is also the lords guidance yes it is t he lords guidance amen ouch like this they pray while doing something and at the same time both of them take damage what the hell are you two doing how many times have i done this straight man act6 while chuckling in a low voice buchou said well then you all today will be the opening of
the restricted use pool yes today is pool the day i have been waiting for the most the pool day us occult research club members were ordered by the student council to clean the pool its already summer and the school has to open the pool buchou already gave her consent to cleaning with the condition of us having the very first use of the pool thus we eagerly took out the moss leftover from taking out the water a few days ago buchou bought a swimsuit she showed us how it was in the house but even though she wasnt wearing it just by looking at it my nosebleed wouldnt stop becau se its amazing it was ecchi7 ill show it to you when we go to the pool this time is what buchou said i waited eagerly for this day ah i have been living for the sake of this day i may be exaggerating but maybe i can become skillful in this years summer the lonely summers till now were probably for this day if you talk about summer vacation its the season where a lot of boys graduate from their virginity i too in this summer
guuah unlike last year this summer i would be surrounded by girls if i have my first sexual experience with buchou its gon na be the best no akeno san is good too i cant bear it i am burning with ju st my delusions i will enjoy kibas share as well who cant come today due to some work isesan are you thinking some perverted stuff asia pulled my cheeks with teary eyes but she couldnt stop my frightful face part 5 dear grandfather in heaven i ts the beginning of summer the shining sun was giving us warm sunlight i couldnt stop my tears in front of this scenery before my very eyes my tears were worth it is what i felt hey ise how does my swimsuit look puh blood was spilling out from my vigorous selfs nose buchous white skin her swimsuit design was showing too much the small red fabric that was her brasserie her b boobs this was not just a level where you could only see the lower part of her breasts the captivating leg lines ar e wonderful as well ara ara buchou you sure are fired up ufufu you really wanted
to show it to ise kun by the way ise kun how does mine look with that akeno san entered as well unlike buchou shes wearing an extreme swimsuit of pure white like her the cloth was small aah if the two onee sama with erotic bodies wore that a lot of young boys would start slouching isesan i i came after changing as well after turning around i saw asia standing while fi dgeting asia was wearing the school swimsuit yeah if a blonde haired bishoujo wore a japanese swimsuit then you would feel an incredible power the name asia written on her chest was wonderful as well asia youre looking cute your onii san is dee ply moved it suits you really well asia let out a smile and seemed to be in a good mood ehehe i am happy that ise san said that koneko chan is wearing a school swimsuit as well ooh koneko chan was wearing a swimsuit like asia huh the name card koneko was cute and wonderful as well yeah its the birth of the lovely mascots not being looked at by obscene eyes is also a bit of a complex feeling i
am getting it seems like shes grumbling with a disappointed feeling huh buchou placed a hand on koneko chans shoulders and while letting out a smile said with that ise sorry but yes part 6 yes 1 2 1 2 i was holding koneko chans hand and helping her out with feet pedalling exercises after coming to the pool the first thing i was made to do was teach koneko chan who couldnt swim ise help koneko out by being her partner is what buchou ordered me to do the person in question koneko chan is taking small breaths in between with a puwa sound and pedalling her feet with her utmost effort somehow seeing her trying her best is cute keep it up koneko chan asia was cheering for koneko chan from the side by the way asia couldnt swim either i had to help out in asias swimming practice as well wait i wasnt t hat good in swimming either yeah for me i just wanted to stare at buchous swimsuit and worship her figure swimming in the water i felt like that while buchou was swimming in the pool her boobs would sway and something amazing would
happen puwa senpai sorry for making you help me out koneko chan said it in an apologetic manner no no its fine helping out with a girls swimming practice is fun i dont really mind its true i would rather help out with a girls swimming practice than to practice with a brat and especially if the partner was the cute asia and the kouhai koneko chan then id do it for the whole day oops we have reached the end completely pedalling for twenty five metres and still having energy left koneko chan c ollided with me even though it was a coincidence the general perception would be that we were hugging each other awawawa if it remained like this then shell say please dont touch me and i might get hit with a punch like usual i was being vigil ant but koneko chans reaction was different ise senpai youre unexpectedly gentle even though youre a pervert i didnt know whether i was being praised or not was it just my imagination that koneko chans cheeks seemed a bit red wwell i also want to do something for my kouhai im always causing trouble for koneko chan so
in such times i definitely want to help i said it while patting koneko chans head i tried to do what buchou does to me a lot if you look at it from the point of view of a person below i would be happy when something like this is done to me by a senpai of the opposite sex wait i dont know if koneko chan is fine with being patted on her head or not splash i heard the sound of someone jumping in the pool in th e other course buchou was swimming elegantly uoooooh this was my chance i dived hurriedly into the water and activated my boosted gear i put the gauntlet on my left hand to my face and transferred the power that was doubled transfer power flowed in both my eyes and my eyesight was suddenly enhanced my field of vision increased i caught sight of buchou swimming far away i believe that my sacred gear was meant to be used in such times facing the water resistance buchous boobs were swaying uni quely with a bouncing movement ah this was it this the resistance generated from water and the swaying of boobs
born from that i yearned for this that voluptuous bust was moving freely in the water what a whimsical method of swaying shit buchou thank you very much those things of yours were too bountiful today alright after going back ill do it 5 times storage in the brain memory storage complete guh inside of my head unforgivable shock is being inflicted guh my breath was escaping inside the water suddenly looking up i found koneko chan having her hand in the form of a chop wont you look at asia senpais swimming next koneko chan seemed to be sullen on the side asia was teary eyed uh even i even i ah somehow even asia looked sullen while i was coughing i once again said to asia alright next is asia are you ready yes ill be under you care like this we moved onto asias swimming lesson next part 7 aaaaaah im tired by the poolside asia was going to sleep on the vinyl sheet that was spread out i helped her out with pedalling practice by grabbing her hand but maybe because she was pumped up beyond expectation we completed the course many times pool exercises require
more energy than gr ound exercises after all for asia who isnt really good at exercising it must have been exhausting koneko chan was also by the poolside resting under the shadow while reading a book fuu i also let out my breath and sat down beside asia i thought th at after becoming a devil my physical strength improved quite a bit but this time i was tired practising on your own and helping out in another persons practice are like two different things after all not to mention that the partner was a girl zzz zzz sounds of sleeping looking at the side asia was sleeping due to being tired man thats a cute sleeping face i definitely wont send her for marriage a red bat came flying towards me who was being healed by asias sleeping face it was buchou s familiar bat after suddenly feeling someones gaze on me i turned my head around on the other side of the pool was buchou there was something that looked like a small bottle in her hand was thatoil cream while smiling she was beckoning me he r mouth moved silently come here uooooooooooooooooooooh i it cant be
feeling something by intuition i ran towards buchous side with godlike speed there was only one thing that i was expecting in my mind thats it right theres nothing except that oiling in midsummer i it couldnt be anything else other than oiling buchous body you could even say that the oil massage was what you imagine in your dreams for the unpopular me it was like an illusion to think that i could use both hands on buchous soft body as much as i wanted uoooh just by my delusions blood was gushing out from my nose hyo hyoudou issei has arrived looking at the excited servant who appeared in front of her buchou showed a surprised expression for a moment but immediately smiled strangely sheesh you really are i just beckoned you here you know wh my heart was seen through by her i immediately blushed uwaah i am embaraaaaaaaaaased i i was certain that she would say that i should oil her this is a bit sad no this wont do since i was called by buchou i want to accomplish some order of hers as im buchous pawn but oiling dont make such a face ise
the reason i called you is just that huh my voice came out in the pause which mea ns devils wont get sunburned but sunlight is a foreign enemy buchou handed me the small bottle in her hand thats a special beauty oil would you apply it on my back yes with pleasure i replied without even missing a beat that was obvious m y brain understood the situation in just a moment i did it oiling exists i thought it was a situation that would only happen in my dreams but it really existed after all my tears wouldnt stooooooop then shall we get ready immediately gently and without any hesitation buchou removed the bra of her bikini in front of me purun as the thing holding them wasnt present anymore the naked boobs showed themselves good afternoon how many times did this make it that i have contacted these boobs sama wait thats not it buchou is it really alright to remove your bra without hesitation in daytime in front of me whos a boy by pressing my nose i somehow managed to stop the stream of blood thats pushing down but maybe because of my perverted natu

are overjoyed by having the upper class elasticity between them applying the oil uniformly on the back i was doing it thoroughly enough to be called futile i couldnt touch the side boobs because i was lacking in courage if i touched them while saying my hand slipped if its buchou she would forgive me but thinking about the feelings of guilt that would be born from doing that i couldnt do it uh i want ed to touch those boobs that have been spread ooooooooooooout although i plan on running my fingers on buchous back to such an extent that it had no meaning behind it if i did it too conspicuously shed probably get mad but i wanted to touch buchous skin forever hey ise yyes on my body theres no place that you havent touched now somehow this body seems to be controlled by ise with buchous stimulating and fascinating line my brain got beaten why can buchou speak such japanese that can tickle a perverts heart do you want to rub oil on my breasts as well buchous beautiful japanese is penetrating my ears my tears started overflowing yyes of course b but is it alright

case in replacement i will let you suck m ine in that instant my thoughts flew away eh just now what did you say before even coming to an understanding of akeno sans words the erotic queen resumed her sens ual temptation right now the thing thats sliding on ise kuns back ill allow you to hold it in your mouth thats what i said right do you get it on my back akeno sans nipples are dancing i understood that my whole body cheered up no matter how much akeno san teased her kouhai me i if she did this while moving your tongue rolling around the pointed tip you can suck it like a kid suck wildly with your instincts as an animal its my first time having a boy suck my boobs so i cant i magine what might happen maybe its because of akeno sans rough breathing its attacking close to my ears i im being attacked by wordsssss was this akeno sans s side it was so stimulating that my mind was blown away hyu bon something passes b eside me i hear something crackling to pieces in the back fearfully looking back one of
the pools diving boards had disappeared taking a glance at buchous direction in the palm of her projected hand is an aura of demonic power did you destroy it facing this direction akeno arent you going too overboard you arent you forgetting that youre my servant buchou let out a menacing voice h her eyes were looking dowwwwwn scary ara ara if you become like that then ill be troubled rias i wont back down eeeeeeeeeek while smiling akeno san closed her eyes then reopened her eyeeees not to mention that her tone was overflowing with anger she surrounded her whole body with a golden aura and sparks were running with crackles around h er buchou lifted her body akeno san also moved away from my body and stood up the two bishoujo senpai with their boobs fully exposed while generating magic power from their bodies were glaring at each other while close to each other uwaaaaaah a girls fight i wont give you ise vulgar priestess of thunder san isnt it fine to be affectionate crimson virgin princess sama arent you a virgin yourself ara if youre going to say that ill have ise kun take my virginity right
now no ise said he would take my virginity immediately following that destructive sounds started reverberating buchou and akeno san flew towards the sky and started a girls fight that wouldnt be called the level of a fight young girls shouldnt say virgin v irgin in the first place akeno you hated men why of all people did you only take interest in ise if you say it like that even you rias had no interest in men you said they all looked the same to you ise is special hes cute even for me isekun is cute i finally met a boy for whom i felt like that so it should be fine to pass ise kun to me for just a bit and let me understand men aaaaaaaaah i somehow dont understand it but it turned into a big fight and wait without even minding that i am here they were letting out dangerous masses of demonic poweeer bam uwah demonic power came flying really close to me the poolside got smashed up this is bad if i stay here ill die ill be killed i want to stop them but i cant stop it the fight of
those girls if i get mixed up in a battle beyond my level ill be annihilated while desperately apologising in my heart by saying sorry buchou akeno san i ran away hastily inside the pool equipment room part 8 pant pant after overcoming the feeling of being on the verge of death i was breathing heavily inside the pool equipment room i barely escaped alive those two onee samas were seriously scary if i had the ability i would be rubbing both of them simultaneously while sa ying something like fufufu by my face stop this fight my honeys however in reality it is futile i curled up in fear and ran away just like that well for those two i would be more like a cat or dog that theyre raising in their club room since i am only one it ended up with them competing against each other for me however buchous and akeno sans way of showing affection for their devil family is beyond my imagination the road to harem king is way too steep wait in my world are there re ally only scary girls i took in a deep breath but suddenly i felt someones
presence xenovia appeared from the inside oh my its hyoudou issei what happened the outside seems a bit noisy its better not to go outside right now and you as well what are you doing here yeah its my first swimsuit so it took me some time to put it on does it suit me even though theres a girls changing room she came all the way here to change it isnt an erotic swimsuit like those of buchou or akeno san but it was a bikini that was emphasising the body curves ah after all this girl has a good body as well its a tight body but its protruding where it should be her boobs are on the bigger side too and her sleek hair as well aah i think it suits you what its the first time youve worn a swimsuit is it because of the churchs rule being so strict that offensive stuff like this is prohibited after all well thats right though before saying that i myself didnt have any interest in stuff l ike this though the girls learning around me the female soldiers let out their dissatisfaction at not being able to touch
things like that i see no matter how you see it fighting seems to fit my nature shes the type to say that sort of thing however not only did my future change even if its just a bit i want to experience the entertainment befitting girls thats how i feel thats what i have started feeling recently huh is that so just dont get any weird ideas that was what xenovia s solemn expression was showing hyoudou issei theres something i wanted to talk about ise is fine youre also my comrade then ise i will say it again wont you make a child with me hm hmmm what did this girl just say right now xenovia inclined her head dubiously and said didnt you hear it alright and once again speaks rapidly ise lets make children together hm hmm were my ears broken right now something that could really make any male happy came flying t o my ears but xenovia said it a third time to me who was doubting my ears ise lets make children together eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh re xenovia closed my mouth which was letting out a loud howl shh dont let out such a loud
voice well be noticed to be said not to let out a loud voice thats impossible what the hell are you thinking m mmmaking children yyou suddenly saying that she nods to the fluttering me yeah lets talk in t urns xenovia talked she was born and brought up in the headquarters of the church rome so that the element to be able to wield holy swords would be born from childhood for god for religion she endeavoured in her training and studies is what she sa id from childhood while saying that dreams and objectives everything was entwined with god and faith for example defeating devils was for the sake of the lord and the one propagating that the vatican while believing that ive never doubted it t hats why after becoming a devil now you can say that my dreams and objectives have disappeared ah i understand that but w why is it that to m mmake children i think the conversation leaped a lot but what is this girl thinking about that pa rt yeah while serving god i had thrown away that part of me a womans happiness my body my heart i sealed everything for
the sake of faith however like this i am currently a devil what i should do initially i didnt understand after asking m y present master rias buchou devils are beings that possess greed fulfill greed award greed and desire greed try living as you wish that was what buchou said thats why i felt free to release what was sealed inside me and become skillful at that release a girls happiness and then my new objective my dream now isto bear children yyou want to do something that a girl can do is that what youre saying until now under your religion your sense of virtue was strong so you could nt do it xenovia nodded yes i want to bear children for that purpose you need a man as well but its great right i can have children and at the same time we can get to know each other better no no no i i understood the story but why me are you dissatisfied even if i am like this i have a bit of confidence in my body as a woman my breasts arent be as big rias buchous but theyre bigger than asias no i
think theyre worth seeing are they not uh she says that while stroking her breasts indeed i think hers are on the bigger side wait its true that i want to rub them like massaging them wwell even i want to do things like that with a girl wait upon hearing that you will allow me to do it i feel like ill spring upon you b but is it fine with doing it me i am not your boyfriend and i havent thought of having children at this age children someday maybe even i will have them until a while back it felt like i had no luck with ladies i had given up at tha t time but after reincarnating as a devil my dreams and my aspirations came back so i started thinking about the future as well after my confirmation xenovia nodded ise is fine i think you dont realise it yourself but you have the aura of a drago n on your body probably because youre carrying the sekiryuutei ive felt it ever since we met for the first time its just a bit but your dragon spirit is increasing iis that so i didnt
realise it myself more than making children i want them t o become strong kids a special power in the fathers genes or otherwise i want greater strength and thats where i think that ise is the most suited one the power of the legendary sekiryuutei even if the kids dont inherit the sacred gear maybe the k ids will inherit the aura this is a good chance definitely this is the lords guidanceuh i unintentionally prayed and received damage but thats how it is and theres perfectly no presence of humans here lets try it out once right now if any thing the faster the better burun suddenly without any hesitation at all xenovia started removing her swimsuit in front of my eyes xenovias breasts were getting expooooooooooooooosed they were springing like boing boing th th the nipple the n ipple is a beautiful pink since she had offered herself to god that meant that no one has touched them right in place of god you will offer them to me huh this girl drip since i started getting weird delusions my nosebleed started flowing t oday its fine no matter how many litres of blood i spurt out
not caring about that she continued speaking i know about the birth rate of devils as well it seems its quite difficult to make kids its especially difficult when both are pure blooded but luckily both you and i are reincarnated devils the base is human and your sexual desire is strong as well i expect that if we do it every day then within ten years i should be able to conceive no if its your strong sexual desire then within a day a number of times should be possible if you include that then i think its possible within five years aah theres no problem from the side of the children as well basically i will raise them however if the children desire love from their father then only at those times do i want you to play with them after all for the children both father and mother are required eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh youve already drawn the image of an expected future unfortunately i dont have any experience with me n i plan on memorising it from now on but for now ill learn from ise who seems to be abundant with knowledge about sex shes a virgin after
all why is it that all the girls around me are voluptuous and without any experience hold me if you d o the procedure for making kids properly i dont mind you doing it as you like xenovia clings to me u uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah on my chest there are b bbboobs hitting on it ttheyre soft shit is it fine to push her down is it fine to prepare myself my first time is not buchou but xenovia theres no one here no can we finish it satisfactorily i am a virgin as well if a man gets hugged here hell go out of his mind has it finally come my graduation ceremony aah matsuda motohoma im going far away ill do extreme things with girls in summer is it for this purpose that a lot of high school students can finish their first sexual experience lets go lets gooooooooooooooooo preparing myself mentally i apologised to buchou in my heart while pushing xenovia down click all of a sudden the equipment rooms door opened up upon looking back ise whats the meaning of this while showing a forced smile buchou was standing there exhausted buchous body was covered by a thin
r ed demonic power layer ara ara thats unfair xenovia chan it was planned that i would take ises chastity akeno san was smiling but somehow a scary aura was surrounding her sob ise san youre mean e even i said it asia seemed like sh e wanted to say something as well while fidgeting shes angry no negligence nor any opportunities to attack koneko chan said that with half opened eyes whats wrong now ise lets make kids xenovia said with an oblivious expression on her fac e heeeeeey in this situation read this atmosphere a biiiiiiiit lets make kids after hearing those words the colours on all the girls faces changed gah i got both my arms caught by buchou and akeno san and im being dragged towards the pool th ere was power surging in the hands holding my arms though buchou theres a reason for this i know its my mistake its my fault for letting my eyes off of you who has an excess of sexual desire for even a bit but you know ise i wonder whats t he meaning of making kids buchou was smiling sweetly scary shes too scary lets see i
want to hear about a mans heart a bit what circumstances would there be for it to turn into a conversation about kids i wonder its akeno sans usual smiling face but her intensity was terrifying gun suddenly a fleeting feeling attacked me looking down at my feet a small girl with great power koneko chan raised my legs up and started dragging me taking the suspect koneko chan what do you plan on doing to me huh looking closely i am being carried away by the girls yes i see first i have to win against buchou fukubuchou and asia this is a very difficult task however if you have more rivals then you burn more heeeeeeey why the hell are you rousing yourself all aloneeeeeeeeee ever since before xenovia run her mouth speaking strange things but no theres also the part where i responded too ise if theres a chance then i want to make children with you so remember that wel l prepare yourself as well xenoviaaaaaaaaaaaaa drop me save meeeeeeeeeee like this i got elements from xenovia that created further friction but if i say so myself my perverted spirit couldnt refuse her ah it was
a stimulating day after leaving from the pool i walked towards the campus comparing it to the days when i had no luck with girls this is heaven seriously however whats this feeling of fatigue the nude bodies of the girls i craved for not to mention the skin of bishoujo sama boobs the memory of those exposed boobs swaying was stored in my brain but i wonder why the things that occurred after that let my exhaustion reach its peak i playback the image of buchou and akeno sans boobs in my head after closing my eyes its wonderful but after that buchou and fukubuchous decisive battle at the top is replayed as well and i curl up at once the angry onee samas are scary yeah i dont want to disobey those two ever xenovia is a problem as well who could have t hought that she would be that bold you cant grasp her but after coming here her initiative has increased even further but shes cute as well that xenovia while leaving the school building a glint of silver came into my eyes it was at the school gate for a moment i had mistaken it
as a scene from a movie an amazing bishounen was looking up at the school building he had silver hair grayfia san was silver haired as well but that bishounen kuns hair was denser more like its dark c olour was stronger he was a foreigner so i couldnt estimate his age by looking at him but maybe he was around the same age as me younger than me no just that he was looking up at the school building just that act was visible to me like an illusio n he must have realised my presence for his eyes were looking towards me those blue eyes were so transparent that one would be drawn in with a smile like an angel he spoke to me while coming towards me hey its a good school umwell sorta i made a forced smile and replied refreshingly whos he there were a lot of overseas students at our school so maybe hes transferring to our school this time i cant let my schools impression look bad either while i was pondering about how i should re ply to questions he would ask regarding the school he let out a single word which
i couldnt have even imagined i am vali the hakuryuukou the vanishing dragon eh what did this guy say this is the second time we meet here huh welsh dra gon sekiryuutei hyoudou issei tthis must be a lie i felt like my left hand was burning i can understand that ddraig residing in me is responding hey hey ddraig was this really him will you unfold your rival showdown at this place wait my he art wasnt properly ready for this if we fight here buchou and the others might be hurt as well i dont feel pressure however what is this premonition of death i am feeling if we did it it wouldnt just be finished with this not only my face but m y body is reacting as well are the things that a previous generations of senpais felt being conveyed from ddraig and the sacred gear is this the thing called destiny dont fuck with me i still havent done ecchi stuff with buchou if i am gon na die ill die after sleeping with buchou what should i do while i was being concerned the vanishing dragon showed an inappropriate smile thats right for example
if i begin to do something magical to hyoudou issei here at the moment when the vanish ing dragons hand was closing in front of my nose zaaa two swords were thrust towards the vanishing dragons neck kiba and xenovia were the ones who appeared in that instant they were holding their holy demonic sword and the holy sword durandal respect ively towards the vanishing dragon i didnt feel their presence at all with the knights god like speed they came running to me who was in trouble the holy demonic sword and the holy sword they were emitting an intense aura together b both of their e yes were pointed to the point of being scary i dont know what you plan to do but dont you think your joke went too far i cant let you start your rival showdown with the sekiryuutei here hakuryuukou kiba and xenovia speak in menacing voices as well however without moving even a bit he its better if you stopped that arent your hands shaking like the vanishing dragon said kiba and xenovias hands were shaking although they were grasping the holy demonic sword and holy sword tightly swords which could be
called tremendous their expressions were stiff its fine to boast not knowing the difference between your opponents strength is strong evidence between me and you there is a decisive difference in power you who couldnt win a gainst the likes of kokabiel wont be able to win against me against the likes of kokabiel hes the leader of the fallen angels who even though the gremory family that combined as one couldnt win against just remembering that battle gave me the creep s and sweat came he was an opponent i didnt know if i could have won against even if i went into boosted gear scale mail mode he must possess a lot of power to be able to look down on him by saying the likes of hyoudou issei what rank do you think your strength is in this world suddenly he asked me that strength mine i dont know i have been told that the sekiryuuteis power is abnormal and that its been often feared but i dont know the actual strength theres also the fact that i myse lf am way too inexperienced counting from the top in your condition of the incomplete balance breaker it
would be a four digit number between one thousand to one thousand five hundred no for the perverted owner it should be even lower i kept on du biously thinking about the opponent whose real motive i didnt know what does he want to say there are a lot of strong people in this world even the crimson haired satan sirzechs lucifer wont fit in the top ten there were so many people stronger t han sirzechs sama honestly the me right now couldnt imagine it the vanishing dragon raised one finger however the first place is decided its a fixed existence who is this about are you saying youre the first he shrugged his shoulders to my question youll know it anyhow however its not me hyoudou issei youre a valuable existence its better if hes raised well rias gremory the vanishing dragon looked in the direction behind me following his gaze i saw buchou standing there oo h its a seriously displeased expression around buchou there was asia akeno san and koneko chan as well correspondingly asia was troubled and in contrast akeno san and koneko chan looked ready to fight hakuryuukou whats the meaning of this if
you have ties with the fallen angels then more contact than required is the two heavenly dragons the dragons called that way welsh dragon and vanishing dragon in the past those related to them didnt live a satisfactory life how will you end up upon hearing that guys words buchous words were stopped buchou what happened she must be concerned about me probably i didnt come here to fight today i just wanted to see the school i visited last time i came to japan while escorting azazel but i was bored i wont fight the welsh dragon here not to mention i have a lot of work to do after saying that the vanishing dragon turned on his heels and started to leave this place even though that guy left a single thread of nervousnes s doesnt go away kiba and xenovia sheathed their swords but there was no relief on their expressions asia who came and nestled to me grasped my hands without any words thanks asia seems like my nervousness loosened just a bit azazel and also the vanishing dragon people who i never wished for keep gathering part 9 after coming back to my room i
sat on the floor with my back on the bed hakuryuukou the vanishing dragon the pair existence of the welsh dragon residing in my left handis what i hear since my boosted gear and the divine dividing hes holding are destined rivals it seemed fighting is their destiny the moment we met ddraig reacted angerit wasnt that i think it was a simple battle impulse at once i unders tood something burning inside me at that place if the opponent came to challenge me ddraig probably would have forcibly made me go into the incomplete balance breaker mode a few days ago during the fight with kokabiel when i first met him i didnt fe el any hostility but this time was different he approached me with interest i think ddraig also felt that things like destiny honestly i dont understand them it seems i just randomly got the boosted gear my senpais of the past who harboured him following their fate kept on the fight between the welsh dragon and the vanishing dragon ddraig explained that to me my surrounding colleagues also appeared that they somehow felt that they would fight alongside me with the other one the vanishing
dragon i dont get it what the heck is up with that i am hyoudou issei and a mere devil why am i getting involved in such dangerous things theres no relation like i care about things like fate although i felt that i couldnt overturn that part even tually do i have to fight him no i held no particular grudges rather i felt grateful he defeated kokabiel ah but hes a comrade of the fallen angels and he took away the reason for me to suck buchous boobs i cant forgive him for that i wonde r what happened for me to become an high class devil it seems like there are going to be a lot of obstacles to raise my status to that of a high class devil if you divide it broadly there are three ways first is continuing to take contracts with hum ans and steadily get more value its what i am always doing even those good at it arent able to do it my first impression was that raising your level from a contract is quite difficult its quite difficult if you cant take contracts from a lot of hum ans for
example the president contracts from those who left their mark in history etc they say theres also the element of luck and it also depends on the master leaving aside the master i dont feel the presence of many big shots in this city e ven under normal circumstances the business world of contracts is going in a lean period but since its a tradition of the devils we cant just stop it second is to perform a noteworthy deed of arms this is like going to a battle similar to the incid ent that happened a few days ago with the leader of the fallen angels invading last time as well i was valued by buchou seems like there were a lot of points well he was the leader class of the enemies even if i defeat a fallen angel leader as a jo ke i would be valued however there werent many people who became high class devils like this thats a given to fight important people from the fallen angels side was more or less impossible due to the status quo of the three factions its even said a battle would not occur once more so thats
a very rare experience the third way is to be active in rating games in reality this is the fastest way according to what i heard from buchou before more like i was told that if i was aiming to become a h ighclass devil i should raise my name via the games in the underworld it seems with these rating games the business world economy of the devils is livened up no matter what merit in the game decides it every distinguished familys rank is connected directly to the merit in the game that roasted fowl guy riser phoenixs family is also one that raised their name through the game those that were reincarnated like me as well a lot of them were valued through the rating game were let into the group of high class devils and stood on the same level as their master and it seems that they received their evil pieces from the maou sama to use for their servants at that time they became kings well there is a rule where they have to come participate as the piece of the master in battle who theyre at the same level as in devils for
the master the fact that they are their familys devil never changes for instance lets assume i become a king in the future for buchous games i shall still be a pawn me and my comrades as well in the near future we shall definitely start participating in this formally if i remember correctly i had heard that immediately after buchou graduates from high school shell start earnestly preparing for participating t heres not even one year left its soon if we assume i become an highclass devil theres no meaning to it if i am not strong at the game since participating in the game is like a high class devils occupation and even if i become a harem king if i d ont have actual strength ill be laughed at by the people around me and ill cause trouble for my master buchou as well so i have to become stronger somehow even if i became a devil i cant be inviting anxiety all the time in the future however b ecause of that my happiness would be all the more when i become a harem king i think also those who value you are the maou samas
great king samas archduke sama etc the really important people to once again put it together my objective is first to become a high class devil for that i have to keep doing everything i can and keep on increasing my value in the games were going to participate in starting next year there are a lot of things i must do and within those i have to do my match with the hakuryuukou ah but if i defeat the hakuryuukou will my value increase no thats an obvious thing to do as the sekiryuutei so i have to finish it vanishing dragon you seriously are a pain are you still thinking suddenly before my eyes b uchous face appeared inverted buchou was reading a magazine while lying horizontally on my bed it seemed she looked into my face from the bed if buchou had any free time she spent it in my room ah no how should i put it i scratched my cheeks buchou descended from the bed and sat beside me i believe in you even if something happens and also if its you i believe you can win against the hakuryuukou buchou said it with a
smile bu buchou my onee samas thankful words and smile t hat clear away all thoughts in my heart buchou uh my face started heating up my tears also started to come out buchou clapped her thighs this signal is come here bubuchou buchous lap pillow my healing space while letting out tears of g ratitude i immediately laid down and was pampered by buchou buchou gently patted my head aah my onee sama sorry that the afternoon was like that i thought of cheering you up but i ended up frightening you instead buchou was worried about it huh nno way me too i wasnt able to meet up to buchou and akeno sans expectations b but i am satisfied that i was able to apply oil to buchou thats true more like thanks to you i was satisfied in a lot of ways i am happy ill ask you to oil m e again then since summers are long yes please leave it to me all right all riiiiiight ill be able to apply oil on buchous body again theres no other happiness like this i was thinking about the meeting with the hakuryuukou so much but thanks
to pervertedness controlling my mind i am refreshed maybe because i was relieved gradually i started feeling drowsy buchous lap pillowfeels good and like that my consciousness went far away to the world of sleep life2 class visit begins part 1 ise asia chan ill come later with otou san my mother was full of spirit since this morning its all right even if you didnt say these things in front of the entrance but more than me she seemed to want to see how asia was doin g she said that even father took a paid vacation well since my parents adored asia like their own daughter theyd want to see her the person in question asia replied with a yes and a huge smile that stretched her entire face the family living with you will come but asia has been so happy and was waiting for this day and just like that it was the day of the visit they said its a classroom visit but in actuality it was more of an open house display it was natural that its all right for p arents to come but it was also all right for students from middle
school to visit and see how the classes are its possible that the guardians of those middle school students will also come to visit its quite an open event not only our parents but al so because kuoh academys middle school divisions kouhais would come to visit we of the high school division were excessively nervous since we didnt want to answer wrong in front of the kouhais 8 i am not interested while sighing buchou said that she somehow seemed to dislike classroom visits though her father and sirzechs sama were visiting it seemed even buchou hated for her famil y to see what her class was like if two crimson haired men visited the classroom itd become a hot topic of discussion i sympathise with you from the bottom my heart this time for my parents beyond me its asia as well so ill be attending class lik e normal we headed for our classroom after parting ways with buchou at the school entrance as soon as i sat on my seat matsuda and motohama approached are your parents coming ise yeah more like both mom and dad said they are coming to see asia matsuda nodded strongly
at my reply ah i understand if asia chan is ones daughter then you would want to come see her by all means thats true if i had a little sister like asia i would be doting on her no in essence shes like a sister to me and i was doting on her as well this sort of thing is a first for me so i am really excited asia seems to be completely excited from her heart yeah if i can see asia excited that alone is enough ise before i knew it xenovia had approached o ur group to be honest xenovia was popular among boys as well since shes quite a bishoujo as well maybe because her physical abilities were also good she was popular among girls as well whats wrong xenovia xenovia lowered her head at my question sorry for saying that sort of thing suddenly the other day that sort of thing ah its about that about making children so she came to apologise for that i kept on speaking without thinking about you yeah as a matter of fact i was scared s uddenly talking about making children no if i can do
ecchi stuff then please let me do it having xenovia as my partner i was totally fine but the order was all wrong suddenly doing that kind of thing is difficult after all i think yes yes like that just like that for the time being we should improve our relationship to the point where we can do ecchi stuff thats why xenovia took out something from her pocket wait thats first we should practice using this xenovia opened a t hing packed in a small pouch in front of my eyes a condom all of the class eyes were gathered on the thing xenovia was holding iidiooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot w what are you taking out in front of the public i am troubled i its obvio us in this sort of a situation that is she is its an extremely intense item to show to high school students who are in a sensitive time more like its totally bad to take it out at school immediately the class was noisy hey they saw that more li ke i am basking in all that attention in the world i was in there was dispute in the use of this but putting it
on in japan would be more convenient following the countrys pattern after all that doesnt matter do something about this atmosphere e veryone in the class is looking at me and you with strange looks you know to be looked at in that way me and you it isnt bad for me i think but think about the time and plaaaaaaaaaaaaaace to my reply xenovia tilted her head she seemed to not understand it quite well not good shes just like how asia was at first shes living in a separate world from this society its good for asia to use it as well unplanned sexual intercourse would hurt both of you the relationship between men and wome n is difficult with that xenovia handed over a piece to asia asia had a questioning look on her face but the perverted glasses kiryuu without missing a beat kept whispering to asia suddenly asia started blushing uuh ah asia fainted after h er head became pure red what what is hyoudou going to become something amazing again with full interest the erotic girl kiryuu asked while her glasses shone but i wonder if its all right if you sleep with xenovia
then asia will kiryuu saaaaan please stoooooooop ooh the suddenly revived asia covered kiryuus mouth somehow she seemed to be in a maximum hurry level but about what geez asia i told you right if you dont start moving soon hyoudou will become something troublesome there are a lot of formidable enemies around him you know if you keep dilly dallying before you know it he may be eaten you wont like that right a man with the scent of another woman ouch why does kiryuu san keep on giving me explosi ve blasts like that i am worried youre fine with me being your only ally right i am fine with a clean mood as well but you got ta do what you got ta do at times even you asia are ripe enough for eating am i r ripe enough for eating that wa s what asia asked me umseriously whats this about i dont understand the meaning of their conversation yeyeah maybe youre ripe enough for eating i answered it while puzzled isnt that great asia youll be eaten kiryuu is filled with a deep emotion what what hey dont leave me behind and continue the conversation
dammmmmit asia chan will be eaten this will be something great asia chan of the committee we have to do an emergency meeting with our comrades and plan counter measures both motohama and matsuda also looked strange they were shaking strongly something is wrong with the world if ises popular matsuda shouted that out geez i dont get it show me your hand a bit kiryuu took my hand and straightened her glasses its good enough you cut your fingernails quite deep iis that so why do you care about my nails so much those men who cut their fingernails quickly play intensely with women is what i hear yes to grope a womans body if you have l ong fingernails then its quite inconvenient tthats a false accusation this is just by chance while saying that i remembered something thats it i had my fingernails taken care of by buchou buchou said it was fingernail practice or something maybe the meaning might be deep but i just did some unjust suspicion ise you shitty bastaraaaaaaard go get some disease or something scary as expected of a beast in the crucial moment just dont transfer the disease to asia asia
will be sullied matsuda motohama and kiryuu teased me uuh bullies even though i dont have even a single girlfriend whats the meaning of this what sort of magic is this it makes me feel like i am a contaminated person wait am i recently becoming po pular i dont really get it starting from matsuda and motohama the surrounding guys have also started looking at me with jealousy but its not like i have a girlfriend i can understand why buchou and akeno san adore me but it seems to me theyre s imply having fun teasing their servant and their kouhai me it was definitely the feeling of pets since they got a good toy its like those two are fighting over it xenovia is since shes unique i cant count her if you ask why it seems shes o nly interested in the thing residing within me asia were living together and shes the girl who has the best relationship with me i come in contact with her in a more or less family like way thats obvious if you start living under the same roof it ll become like that i think of her as a
cute younger sister as well i am happy that shes depending on me from the bottom of her heart could you call shopping together a date we go shopping together for dry goods a lot to discount stores but its qui te different from the showiness of a dateit would be strange if koneko chan yearns for me yeah after all more than being popular its just that the number of girls have increased from my previous life isnt it totally different from the harem life that i desire harem is to do as much as i like with the above previously mentioned girls and indulge in them as much as i want that is what i think it is if i was able to do an experiment as my daily special meal it would be to adjust the people wat ching me however this life compared to my previous life of not having a single breath of girls is like a totally different life its like the difference between heaven and earth with this big of a difference i am enjoying it just by being able to ta lk with girls i am satisfied with this lifestyle no with
this preparedness i wont be able realise my dream harem all right lets get the power to be able to take girls in hordes on the contrary after i loved someone sincerely its now difficul t to even extend my hand towards girls even a bit raynare my first girlfriend was a fallen angel who killed me after deceiving me maybe because that happened even the perverted me would be like this its not like i am afraid of girls but somewhere within my heart i have a feeling that maybe in the end i will be repudiated by them buchou asia i know that the girls of the club wouldnt do such a thing however the more i start liking them the more i am worried am i being hated by buchou and the others sometimes i ask that of myself the girls i got on good terms with after such a long wait i dont want to be hated thats why in the end i dont want to do anything weird and be hated by them i dont want that to happen once more everyone ise san isnt a bad person please dont bully him asia stood in
front of me and protected me from matsudas staggering uuh asiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa its only you who is my ally i will believe in ise san forever and ever what a good girl she obstinately believes in me aah our asia chan is my ally i am seriously happy asia asia to confess amidst the confusion not bad kiryuu muttered something i was sure it had to be something bad about me thats it no matter how indecent i se is ise is a frank person its just that his sexual desire is also as frank as him surely xenovia also followed up with that somehow i felt like i was slightly being made fun of but from this girls perspective it would probably be a top clas s follow up and with that its time for the sexual intercourse but thats why dont say that stuff in front of people i wrapped my hands around my head and hit the table in response to xenovia who seemed to not have understood anything up ti ll now part 2 somehow the class started and from the open door in the back parents of my classmates kept coming in the class was english
the male teacher who was pumped up more than usual was for some reason distributing a rectangular object wrappe d in a bag to the students huh whats this did this sort of thing happen in english for the devils who can speak in all languages english was the best place to show it fufufu today as well lets do it proficiently and fluently however give me a break in writing words that is impossible while thinking that i looked at the object closely um is this pvc clay9 the teacher gleefully s aid to me who was dubiously thinking that got it try making something you like with the pvc clay i handed you just now an animal is fine as well a person is fine as well a house is fine as well whatever image youre thinking about in your mind righ t now try making it into a shape that sort of english conversation is also there theres no such thing i dont get what you mean sensei lets do a usual english class allow me to show my english conversation skills to my parents i dont want to ma ke pvc clay lets try10 its not
lets tryyyyyyyyyyyyyy in which world is there an english class with pvc clay iits difficult huh asia chan shes already making it as usual her adaptation to these sort of things is fast asia chan keep going asia chan youre looking cute while turning my head to the voices i recognise my parents were facing asia and yelling ooh when did you enter the room more like while their son was over here they were facing their video camera towards asia dad realising father and mothers voice she turned back and did it happily arent they perfectly like parents and child no with that i was also more than happy my little sister asia chan its the best and upon surveying the surroundings i saw that everyone was reluctantly kneading the pvc clay were you all right with this everyone of the class knead knead i also started knea ding with no way out what did he say we should make he said it was fine to make anything that you imagined in your mind while twisting the clay i closed my eyes and started having wild ideas the very first thing that i imagined was ise it was a
nude buchou who was smiling at me aah buchou my onee sama to imagine you first my devotion my wholehearted thought was the real thing fufufu i even remembered the breasts and the nipples perfectly i remembered perfectly in my memory everything a bout buchous boobs the size the elasticity and the softness buchou said that there werent many parts of her body that i hadnt touched indeed thats true i might have someway or another touched buchous every point it was slippery and soft and ev en then it was full of elasticity while noticing a red thing of desire oozing from my nose i reproduced buchous body from my mind while my eyes were closed only from the image in my mind i moved my hands aah buchous boobs buchous constricted wa ist buchous butt which was meant for an easy delivery buchous thick thighs perfect for me the vision of everything was burned in the memory of my brain i remembered it vividly it was natural everyday i remembered it during that time hyo hyoudou kun i suddenly noticed there there was someones hand on my shoulder opening my eyes and turning my face i found it
was sensei for some reason he was shaking his whole body with an astonished expression on his face what somehow it seems he was a stonished from looking at my hands i also looked at my hands andthere was a magnificent statue of buchou present there ooh there was an excited cheer from the class more like while looking at me they let out a breath of admiration ooh amazin g its surely a mini buchou the shape of the boobs the shape of the butt the lines of the thighs everything was perfect as well i i made this while moving my hands based on the image of buchou i had burned in my brain a miracle occurred wwond erful hyoudou kun to think that you had this sort of talent this class was the right choice after all once again i was able to draw out a students hidden ability sensei said that while his eyes were soaked with tears indeed to think that th is power was hiding inside me even if i say so myself its easy to bloom a talent related to my pervertedness tthat is rias senpai shit as i thought ise you rascal
with senpai no way rias onee sama with that beast somehow i could h ear screams nearby as well but the moment someone in the class said five thousand the class started changing no six thousand ill pay seven thousand ill be skilful with gremory senpais body dont joke with me ill buy it tonight shell keep me company eight thousand the english class which used the pvc clay did a complete change it changed into an auction house for the statue of buchou i made part 3 it was lunch break it is well made that is what buchou said smiling while touch ing the statue made of pvc clay during the class in the end i didnt sell the statue to my classmates i couldnt sell it since it was buchous statue when asia and i went outside to buy something to drink we encountered buchou and akeno san coinciden tally in front of the vending machine ara ara as expected of ise kun who looks and touches buchous body everyday akeno san was also smiling surprised by the quality of the statue no i wasnt doing those things every day with buchou as you were ex pecting
when i personally experienced the valuable body i burned it into my brain would you make one for me as well next time if you want to reproduce my body i will remove my clothes you can touch me seriously akeno san thats the best by all means while trying to say that buchou and asia pulled my cheeks dont do it dont do it the girls of my house were harsh by the way buchou did sirzechs sama come on my question buchou put a hand on her forehead and let out her breath yeah he came along with my father so her father came as well what kind of class visit was it i was curious ah buchou moreover everyone came as well kiba appeared there hm did kiba also come to buy a drink ara yuuto tea upon buchous que stion kiba pointed with his finger ahead of the corridor no for some reason i heard a witch was doing a photography event so i thought to see it a bit on kibas reply buchou and i tilted our heads while exchanging glances kaccha kaccha flashes kept going off as the men who were holding cameras were
photographing something at a corner of the corridor since there was a crowd present i didnt know what they were taking pictures of according to kibas story a witch was present but i someh ow came out of the crowd and faced in the front direction yeah i could see it in a glance as i progressed further a recognisable outfit came jumping in my eyes quite a good bishoujo chan was wearing a costume of an anime character if i remembered cor rectly it was magical girl mil kiss viral 7 alternative heart of a maiden body of a male the special mil tan was engrossed in this anime ah when looked at closely she resembled mil kiss she was spinning her stick or whatever round and round as w ell the cameramen were taking photographs excited like youngsters i also wanted to take one picture her skirt was short so her panties were intermittently being exposed buchou arrived beside me after coming out of the crowd as soon she looked forwa rd to the magical girl mil kiss she panicked wh because of her excessive confusion i got surprised as well for buchou to be surprised in this
way hey hey you whos doing a photography shoot on a public path while saying that my friend fro m the student council saji came jumping through the crowd girls who looked like members of the student council as well came following saji towards the photography scene hey hey disperse disperse todays the day for displaying classes to the public dont make a ruckus at this kind of place saji he was doing his job properly huh that big of a crowd was disappearing like a spiders children dispersing the young men with the cameras who were photographing were also leaving reluctantly due to saj is pushing the remaining people were our group and sajis group as well as and the cosplay girl you too please dont wear that kind of costume wait would you be a parent perhaps even if thats the case you know theres a dress code according to t he place this is troublesome eh but this is my uniform saji pressed his warning but mil kiss didnt pay any heed to it while posing in cute poses saji ground his teeth but as soon as he recognised buchou he lowered his head oh its riassenpai
you came at the right time i was just guiding maou sama and senpais otou san as saji turned his head towards the back the crimson haired males approached under the guidance of sona sitri kaichou whats this saji i always tell you to settle things decisively the strict kaichou said that but as soon as she saw mil kiss she stopped speaking sona chan found you after finding kaichou mil kiss happily clung to kaichou ooh an acquaintance of kaichou as expected even saji was having an expression like he was having trouble dealing with this hm i just noticed this then but huhuh huh somehow i felt like kaichou and that cosplay girl seemed to resemble one another i doubtfully thought this without minding sirzech ssama called out to the cosplay girl aah its you serafall so you came here as well serafall i i seem to have heard this name before its leviathan sama for a moment i couldnt understand buchous words buchou said once more to me who didnt get it that person is one of the current four maous serafall leviathan sama and also shes sonas onee sama eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee my scream ec hoed in
the corridor naturally are you serious it must be a lie the super beauty maou sama that i even saw in my dreams was this person no indeed she was a super beauty even though she was kaichous onee sama her beauty was something that wouldn t lose to buchou however i was imagining a more fascinating onee sama with more hormones floating around and glamorous boobs huge as well while showing her thighs from a slit i imagined a female maou sama who would speak sensual words from her glossy lips i didnt think it would be a girl wearing a cosplay uniform and speaking in a cute way although it was true that she was beautiful serafall sama its been a long time ara riaschan long time no see have you been doing well what a cute tone buchou was also a bit troubled yyes thanks to you did you come today for sonas class visit yeah sona chan is really mean she didnt tell me about today geez because of the shock onee chan was going to attack heaven just because of that you would attack heaven i didnt know if she was joking or if she
was being serious ise greet her like buchou said i lowered my head and greeted her nnice to meet you i am hyoudou issei i am rias gremory samas servant pawn ill be under your care nice to meet you i am the maou serafall leviathan call me levia tan while turning sideways the cosplay girlno maou leviathan sama made a peace sign w whats with this super light developmentttttttttt hey sirzechs chan is this boy the rumoured dragon kun she called sirzechs sama with a chan can you forgive her no since they were both maou samas it was ok yes hes the person in which the we lsh dragon resides hyoudou issei kun sirzechs sama also didnt say anything about her adding chan so he must be called like that always ara ara uncle gremory yes serafall dono11 this is another novel uniform i somewhat think that as a maou its a bit too ara uncle dont you know this is the fashion in this country you know heh is that so it seems this was my ignora nce hahaha otou ue dont believe it etc are what gremory family and leviathan sama are conversing bubuchou its a
light mood far surpassing my imagination but serafall sama is buchou also apologised by saying sorry upon seeing my bewildered state i forgot to say itno i didnt want to say it but every one of the four current maou samas is like this during private times they are really amicable to a severe extent while letting out a sigh buchou said that impossible was it fine for the maou samas of the devils to be like that looking at it kaichous face was also completely red it was probably that upon looking at her elder sister her speech and conduct she was feeling completely embarrassed noticing that leviath an sama looked into kaichous face with worry sona chan whats wrong your face is completely red you know since its the long awaited reunion with your onee sama me i think it would be better if you were a bit more happy onee sama so tan calling like that and embracing each other in a yuri way that sort of development is fine with me as well onee chan that was extremely difficult was this leviathan sama kaichou said with an unsatisfied expression while twitching near her eyes oonee sama
this is my school and i am entrusted with the job of the student council president here no matter how close relatives we are onee samas behaviour is too much i cant approve of that sort of outfit no way sona chan if i am told t hat by sona chan your onee chan will be sad sona chan doesnt know that her onee chan is admired as the magical girl since with the glittering stick i erase angels and fallen angels onee sama please be prudent if my onee sama the maou glitters then this small country would be destroyed many times over she isnt a mahou shoujo but more like a maou shoujo maou shoujo serafall leviathan sama is scary12 hey saji when one of the leaders of the fallen angels invaded kaichou didnt call her onee san looking at this are they not on good te rms its the opposite the opposite since serafall leviathan sama dotes on her little sister so much if she had been called it would have become something terrible it seems that if she found out that her little sister was injured by the fallen angel we didnt know how she would
have reacted it would have probably meant instant war it was the correct decision to not call serafall sama and rather call lucifer sama however i am meeting her for the first time as well but this is ah i see wai t was maou sama okay with that ah saji was also bewildered uuh i cant bear it that calm and composed kaichou eyes became wet and she ran away from that place wait sona chan where are you going while leaving your onee chan behind maou sho ujosama ran behind her please dont follow me noooooo dont abandon your onee chaaaaaaan so taaaaaan i have asked you so many times not to add tan the maou sisters chase its my request but please dont erase this school with some rhyt hm of yours yeah the sitri household is peaceful dont you think so ria tan onii sama dont add a tan to my pet name and call me that please this time the embarrassing conversation started in the gremory household heh buchou was called ri a in her home huh no wayria tan even though in the past you followed me every time while saying onii sama onii

you idiot aah buchou ran away after not being able to bear it any more supan sirzechs sama is knocked down by grayfia sans paper fan buchou i became worried and chased after buchou part 5 buchou was sitting in front of my room she was puffing her cheeks as if in displeasure i wonde r whats wrong bubuchou would you like to enter my room buchou nodded without any words somehow she became a normal girl after entering the room buchou jumped on the bed and was quiet while lying upside down it was a situation where it was diff icult to say anything i sat on the floor and was searching for some sensible words in my brain my mother father and your family sure got along well uh no words no i felt that a silent room was more displeasing so without worrying i contin ued this meeting isi feel it is good dad and mom also seem to be enjoying it your father and the others as welltheres also the point that they were too upbeat but i know i am happy too that my father and ises father were talking happi ly ah i got
a reply thats good hey ise yes are you happy to have met me i didnt imagine that question buchou continued on i am happy to have met ise a life without you is impossible think of it as an honour you hold a lot of space in my heart you know yyou were that affectionate for me huh i have got her favour as a servant its an honour i am also happy to have met buchou i can declare this positively but when i think that someday buchou will also get a boyfriend i cant take itthinking that you might go some place far away buchou raised her head and told me ara i wont get myself a boyfriend you know more than that for you to say that stuff its a bit of a shock eh b but dont you have to get you rself a husband thats true for the continuation of the house getting a son inlaw for the house is important no once more i didnt get it i decided to model the son inlaw of my house myself if i have to do it anyway ill rear him accord ing to my own
ideals that way is faster hey ise haah i see i didnt get it much but buchou was going to raise the son inlaw herself huh if i were to wish i wanted to be in that place but that in itself was very hard the future husband of bu chou what kind of husband would be born after being reared by buchou nooo i want to be in that place after all but i wonder if its impossible i have thought about my marriage ceremony as well you know japanese style would be good for the reception somewhere in japan would be good if you talk about a place with beautiful scenery then buchou had already imagined it till there huh no i want to marry buchou my mouth was suddenly closed she had her arms around my neck and with a chuui received buchous kiss uoooooooh i i am kissing buchou once againnnnnnn t this sensation of lips to be able to taste it again its a soft and sensual contact its my second kiss with buchou i did it i received buchous second kiss um f or what thing is this a reward for n no lets
leave the small details out i i want to be proficient in this sensationnnnn with that while i was moved buchous tongue was abruptly tasting my lips like that itll enter my mouth guh mine and bucho us tongues intertwined a bit and after doing that i was pulled back by my neck and the kiss that i felt would go deeper had ended a thread of saliva was going though mine and buchous mouth buchou seemed to be making an expression of regret uhiiii for a thread of saliva to form from mine and buchous mouth i feel like ill die after being moved so much no its all right to die ah as i thought no if i had to die then i want to die after doing more tongue action with buchou more like i dont want to ever forget the sensation of buchous licking it was really amazing uh the one who had pulled my neck back was asia she was teary eyed hey asia dont interrupt me when i am being affectionate with ise even though he seemed to be enjoying his long awaited deep kiss that he was desiring its quite difficult to create
opportunities you know bbuchou your method of being affectionate with your servant is escalating i am happy thank you very much but due to the stimulation being too strong every time my brain goes numb just buchou san is unfair the early bird gets the worm i learned it in my battle against akeno what did you learn buchou uoooooh buchou and asia are glaring at each otheeeeeeer once again a batt le of girls is beginning in my room recently its happening a lot here while i thought that the silver haired maid san intervened you two fighting isnt good i think its especially unwise in front of issei sama after separating the two who were glaring at each other grayfia san calmed them down thats true fighting isnt good moreover sirzechs sama also entered my room was the admiration meeting over i slipped out for a bit theres something that i need to talk about again rias its the continuation of the talk from daytime talk what would it be ah buchou and akeno san were called by sirzechs sama to me who was questioningly thinking that sirzechs sama said something which was beyond my imagination lets talk
about the other bishop that was about the mysterious bishop who was already present before me and asia were reincarnated part 6 the next day after school i was standing on the ground floor of the old school buildings room that had been made the sealed classroom e veryone from the club had gathered even from the outside this room was securely closed so we couldnt see inside of the room what was it used for the explanation was without exception butit seemed that according to the conversation the other bish op was here the other bishop for a long time it was a mystery club member for both asia and me likewise except for the newcomer xenovia the rest of the members knew about it he existed before i became a devil but due to various circumstances he couldnt participate in the rating game between the phoenix household and the battle against kokabiel according to the conversation it seemed his ability was regarded as dangerous and because buchou wasnt able to completely control him with her powers he was ordered to be sealed by the higher ups what exactly was he was he that dangerous last night sirzechs sama
explained it in my room it seemed buchou had received a high evaluation by the four maous the great king bael house the archduke agares house and the great devils due to her fight with the phoenix house and the fight against kokabiel the sealing condition of the other bishop was lifted while thinking that maybe she could control him now and with that we were in front of the sealed cla ssroom but a tape with keep out written on it was heavily pasted with magical seals carved on the kid is over here all day that bishop lives here for the time being his seals are loosened deep in the night and if its just in the old building he can exit the room but the kid inside refuses to do that that was what buchou said for some reason she knocked on the door and then started expanding her magic circle shes releasing the seal if one was sealed in this cramped space for even hal f a day wouldnt one go insane it was impossible for me if i was told that i was free to do anything in the old school building only in the
night i would have happily run out iis the person a hikikomori on my question buchou nodded while letting out a sigh was that so a hikikomori huh kiba removed the tape while akeno san also helped out alongside buchou in removing the seal the kid inside has been the biggest earner among the servants akeno san said that seriously biggest earner how does that person earn akeno san continued as if replying to my question the kid takes special contracts from humans through a computer frankly its a person who doesnt want to meet us those type of people negotiate in a different way and make rela tions differently they solve things through the computer in the dealings through computers among the new devil servants this kid grabs enough numbers like those of a superior rank amazing negotiating through a computer and with that this kid took contracts from humans huh now then i am opening the door the magical seals carved on the door also disappeared and it became a simple door buchou opened the door noooooooooooooooooooooooo an outrageously high scream was emitted from insi de w what was it buchou wasnt even surprised rather while sighing she
entered the room alongside akeno san good day to you its nice to see you all energetic wwwhyyyyyyyy the exchange happening inside was heard judging from the voice it c ould have been a middle schooler butwas it a girl or was it a younger male i couldnt say for sure yet though i could say that the person was extremely confused ara ara the seal got removed you know you are able to go out now now lets all go out together akeno sans gentle voice i sensed sympathy i felt she was gently trying to connect however noooooooooooooooooo this place is gooooooooooood i dont want to go outside i dont want to meet peopleeeeeee wwasnt that a serious case of hikikomori asia and i exchanged glances and tilted our heads xenovia also let out a questioning look only kiba and koneko chan understood the circumstances huh kiba was smiling bitterly and koneko chan was letting out a sigh i strengthen ed my resolve and timidly peeked in walking in just a bit i glanced in the room the curtains were tightly shut close dim the room was decorated in an unexpectedly cute manner it looked like a girls
room stuffed dolls were present as well a a coffi n there was a single coffin present in one corner that seemed to be used in funerals abroad buchou and akeno san were in the interior was the bishop present past them approaching further the one present there wasa bishoujo with noble looks golden hair and red eyes who looked like a doll she was sitting down on the floor with a pose that looked as if she wanted to escape from buchou and akeno san she was shaking a lot wait she was dressed in kuoh academys girls uniform more like she was extre mely cute ooh a girl not to mention a foreigner wonderful another golden haired bishoujo after asia huh i am happy there would be two blonde bishops there was no greater joy than that i was happy like that but buchou turned her head sideways appearance wise this kid looks like a girl but he is a boy without a doubt eh for a moment there i doubted my ears plainly absurd words entered my ears b buchou please stop with the jokes doesnt this kid look like a bishoujo no no no n o
matter how you look at it its a girl buchou eh seriously he has a hobby of dressing in female clothes akeno san said that calmly hobby of dressing in female clothes t then this kid was not wearing that uniform because hes a girl but because of a hobby eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh i gave out a large shriek due to my big shock eeeeeeeeeeek i am sorry i am sorryyyyyyyyyyy the golden haired bishoujono the golden haired guy in girls clothes let out a shriek due to my voice seriously hes a boy even like this no no no matter how you looked at it that part of him was more like a bishoujo than even girls i seriously didnt get it even the voice was like a girl his height was small as well uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i held my head with my arms and crouched down in that place this was irrational for him to be a boy even though he was so cute was god merciless wait god wasnt present then it was merciless he definitely got his gender wrong while inside his mother he got something extra stuck on him uwaaaaaa i cant take it is it alright to
have such a cruel story he perfectly looks like a bishoujo for him to be a manfor him to have a penis on him talking about vulgar words is prohibited auh before i knew it koneko chan had entered the room sorry koneko chan but this is a cruel story its an even more painful story that he has a hobby for wearing girls clothes since it suits him when i heard the unnecessary truth the shock was too huge even though hes a hikikomori hes got a hobby of wearing girls clothes are the girls clothes to show to someone on my words the cross dressing young boy refuted bbbbut girls c lothes are super cute dont say things like super cuteeeeeeeeeee shit even though youre a guuuuy you shattered my dream in a instanttttttttt i i was actually dreaming about you and asia the double blonde bishoujo bishops you know give it back give back my dream writings and dreams of people are transient koneko chaaaaaaaaan that didnt sound like a joke however that was cruel i thought of him as a girl but it was a guy in girls clothes bbbby the way who is this person
the guy in girls clothes asked buchou buchou said it while pointing to me asia and xenovia these are new servants who came while you were here the pawn hyoudou issei the knight xenovia and like you the bishop asia we said nice to meet you b ecause we were introduced but girls clothing kun only fearfully said eeeeek the members increased by a lot no is he phobic to humans this is terrible please can we go out okay its all right for you to not be sealed any more you know bucho u said it gently but noooooooo for me the outside world is impossibleeeeeeee i am scared i am scared of the outside in any case even if i go outside it would only cause trouble for otherssssss somehow i got angry also i couldnt forgive hi m for being a male with that face i approached him and pulled his arms hey buchou said to go outside it was the moment i was trying to pull him eeeeeek along with the girls clothing kuns scream the scenery in front of me became white hm huh even though i should have been holding his arms right then
girls clothing kun wasnt there looking at it he was shaking in one corner of the room huh why i was definitely just pulling his arm then this is strange something in this moment its certain something happened asia xenovia and i were surprised by the mysterious phenomenon but the rest of the members were only letting out sighs kiba and the others of course knew about it dont get angry dont get angry please dont hit meeeeeeeee as usual the girls clothing kun was just shouting what did this guy do noticing my doubt akeno san explained that kid possesses a sacred gear that caused the time of everything in his field of vision to be stopped for a fixed inter val of time when hes excited wait stopping time seriously that idiot looking kid had a sacred gear with a powerful ability he possessed such a gear thats why for a moment we felt malice he stopped us and ran away huh even though i said run ning away i thought he possessed a serious illness of not being able to go out from this room that was intolerable because he cant control his sacred gear by the
orders of the archduke and the maou sirzechs sama he was sealed i understood that th anks to akeno sans supplementary explanation he could stop time that was an extremely fearful power if he couldnt control it then hed probably hurt his comrades as well was that the reason buchou hugged girls clothing kun from behind and then sa id to us this boy is gasper vladi hes my bishop for the time being hes a first year student in kuoh academy also before being reincarnated he was a dhampir1314 life3 i got a kouhai boy part 1 the evil eye that stops the woforbidden balor view buchou nodded to my question yes thats the name of the sacred gear gasper possesses its very powerful to stop time isnt that close to breaking the rules upon hearing my words buchou responded yes thats true but your doubling power and hakuryuukous halving power are both against the rules too you know tthats true buteven then to be able to stop time you can only ignore rules so much the problem is that hes not able to handle it because of that gasper had been sealed till now him unconsciously activating his
sacred gear was seen as a problem just like i thought huh however you sure were able to make a guy with such a powerful gear into your servant buchou n ot to mention to be able to do it with just one piece on my words buchou brought out a book in her hands from mid air flipped the pages of the book and presented it to me opened looking at it it was the explanation page for evil pieces its a mutation piece mutation piece kiba answered to my question its different from the usual evil piece bodies that clearly require more than one piece to be reincarnated can be reincarnated in one piece its a piece that can make such a phenomenon occur buchou possessed that piece that is what akeno san said kiba continued further usually for high class devils one in ten devils possesses a single piece its an irregularity born when the evil piece system was created its kind of like a bug but it seems like it was kept for fun gasper kun is the one who used that piece oh that means buchou used a rare piece on gasper huh the problem
is gaspers ability buchou what do you mean he possess a rare ability and it seems his sacr ed gears power increases when hes unconscious maybe because of that every day his power is increasing from the previous conversation we can say that in the future theres a possibility he may attain balance breaker bbalance breaker that was even in the best of times a dangerous thing right if the guy whos incapable of controlling his own power attained it not to mention its a sacred gear that stops time maybe because she understood from looking at my surprised appearance buchou a lso put her hand on her forehead with a troubled face yes its a critical situation however because my evaluation was accepted it seems i was now judged able to control gasper by the people that evaluated me maybe its because i made ise and yuuto a ttain balance breaker leaving kiba aside mine was limited with conditions attached and that too was incomplete you know ah i heard that i too was valued quite a lot when i defeated that bastard riser my master buchou would have been valued even mor e i guess and even though
the vanishing dragon intervened we were able to defend our base without any large destruction in the incident with kokabiel thats why if it was the current buchou she might be able to handle gasper was what the big people judged huh uh e eeven though i dont want you to talk about me theres a big cardboard box placed beside me he was speaking from there i kicked it silently eeeeeeeeeek a shout was heard whose is it of course its gasper kun because he s extremely scared of the outside world it seems he entered a cardboard box this guy is you hate them that much places outside of this room judging by ability maybe after akeno he would be next even though i say half vampire hes from a pureblooded vampire family with a good lineage and has a powerful sacred gear because of his human half hes well endowed with the abilities of vampires and he excels in human magic wielded by wizards as well if not so then he probably would have been made a bishop with just one evil piece that was what buchou said wow hes that amazing huh this hikikomori vampire kun
ah but was he all right with daylight and stuff like that buchou vampires are weak against the sun right is he fine buchou no dded to my question he possess the blood of a special vampire known as a daywalker which can move during the day so theres no problem however he may dislike it a daywalker heh there was a vampire like that huh i hate daylighttt its better if the sun disappeareeeeeed i see i see even for devils the sun was like a natural enemy however since were students of this school its not good if we dont attend school during the day you know you dont attend class right if you dont contro l your power and open yourself up then it isnt good you know i said that but he just screamed no i am fine inside this cardboard box the air and light of the outside are a natural enemy to meeeee please let me remain a boy who lives in a cardboa rd boooooox this is terrible i wonder whats wrong also doesnt he need blood hes a vampire right buchou responded to my question since hes a half vampire he doesnt
thirst for blood as often if you supply the blood for him once every ten days then theres no problem though it seems he originally didnt like drinking blood i hate blooooood i hate fish tooooooo i hate liver as welllllll if youre a vampire with intense likes and dislikes then what the hell will you do a good fornothing vampire koneko chan spewed out those words as expected she didnt show mercy uwaaaaaaah koneko chan is a meanieeee is it because theyre first year class comrades that she wont be merciful huh even though i am of a higher class she doesnt go easy on me either for the time being till i come back ise asia koneko xenovia ill leave gaspers training to you akeno and i will be going to the meeting place for the top of the three factions and yuuto it seems onii sama want s to hear in detail about your balance breaker so you should accompany us yes buchou buchou has it tough too wait kiba was called by maou sama about that holy demonic sword ah if i remembered correctly that sword was an irregular form for a sa cred gear since
that balance breaker was an impossible phenomenon originally well wanting to investigate would be natural isekun sorry but ill leave gasper kun to you yeah leave it to me kiba well since asia koneko chan and xenovia are here too well do something probably to be honest i am a bit uneasy the hikikomori vampire i am very worried about the future gasper kun you should start getting used to the outside you know akeno san spoke to the cardboard box akeno onee sama aaaaaa please dont say stuff like thaaaaaaaat ara ara thats troubling ise kun ill leave it to you yes if i am requested by akeno san then ill do my best as well i cant betray buchou and akeno sans expectations yeah then ise shall i thoroughly discipline him a weak man is no good and also i wanted to face off with a vampire since childhood leave his treatment to me with that xenovia pulled on to the rope attached to gaspers cardboard box wanted to face off against wait d o you want to destroy gasper eeeeeeeeek n nnno way i dont want to fight against the user of the holy sword durrandaaaaal i
ill be destroyeeeeed dont scream gaspair if you like shall i prepare a cross and holy water and also attack you w ith garlic eeeeeeeeeek garlic noooooooooo it may have been his misfortune to have met xenovia that was what i thought more like if a devil exorcises then theyll receive damage as well xenovia san i am worried about the future part 2 hey start running if youre a daywalker then you should be able to run in the day eeeeeeek dont chase me while swinging durandaaaaaaal as we approached evening the vampire was being chased by the holy sword wielder looking at it from an outsiders perspective it seemed completely like a vampire hunt durandal was also letting out a dangerous sound while emitting a holy aura gasper was also desperate in running away well thats because if she catches up h ell be destroyed in an instant it seemed that xenovia was training him starting from physical strength on the pretext that a healthy spirit starts from a healthy body she was a lively lady as usual this lady who was swinging the legendary weapon and chasing him seemed to be happy as well now that i
think about it after she became used to living here xenovia said that from what she does and what she has to do everything is enjoyable that part was probably the same as when asia got used to livin g in this city since they lived their lives in a simple fashion as believers and with japan being a place with almost no religion its workings would be fresh to them even though it was an honour to have met the bishop san just like me we havent even properly seen each others facessob asia seemed regretful shes also a bit tearful at my house she used to say a lot i want to meet the other bishop san so she was looking forward to their meeting even though it was their long awaited encoun ter since hes a max level human hater it couldnt be helped well we were all devils more like not even seeing our asias face shit i couldnt forgive that part however i have to bear with it although hes a senpai as a devil hes a junior in school theres also the part where i have to guide him as his senpai as well
meanwhile koneko chan was chasing gasper alongside xenovia while holding garlic gya kun if you eat garlic youll become healthy nooooooo koneko chan is bullying mee eeeee are these two first years getting along well i had heard that koneko chan could be a unique irritating character butwas she bullying him more like koneko chan is calling him gya kun oh oh theyre at it with that the student counci l member saji appeared as well oh its you saji yo hyoudou after hearing that there was a hikikomori servant whose ban had been lifted i came to see it for a bit ah hes over there hes the one getting chased by xenovia hey hey xenovia san shes swinging the legendary sword heartily you know is it all right huh oh wait its a girl huh not to mention blond haired saji seemed happy you would think that right sorry to say this but thats a guy cross dressing hearing that saji seemed to be completely dejected hes heartbroken well this is swindling more like since hes wearing girls clothes it would be to show it to someone right and since hes a hikikomori its too much of a
contradiction its quite difficult thats right its an incomprehensible cross dressing habit also i cant say anything about it suiting him so what are you doing saji saji was wearing a jersey army cotton gloves and was also holding a small shovel for flower bed use its as yo u see its the maintenance of the flower bed its been kaichous orders since a week ago hey recently there have been many events in the school right and also next time maou sama and the others are coming here as well its the job of the pawn of t he student council me to make the school look beautiful he puffed out his chest and acted magnificently but doesnt that mean hes in charge of odd jobs meh i cant break his sentiments so its best to keep quiet za za after that conversati on there was a presence of someone coming near us when i moved my gaze to the direction i doubted my eyes heh the servants of the maous families devils are playing over here there was an evil looking male wearing a yukata there i recognised him azazel yo sekiryuutei its been some time since that
night everyone was dubiously staring at him who appeared suddenly with my single word the atmosphere completely changed giii xenovia had her sword at the ready maybe because she sensed the atmosphere asia hid behind me i made my boosted gear appear as if protecting her why is the governor of the fallen angels at a place like this saji while also shocked brought out the face of a deformed lizard on his right hand its sajis sacred gear hyhyoudou by azazel you mean i am serious saji i have come in contact with this guy plenty of times maybe because of my serious response he understood saji made a battle position as well azazel smiled bitterly at our postures let a lone thirst for blood i didnt even feel the presence of him trying to fight a battle i dont feel like fighting hey relax your postures low class devil kun you should somehow know that even with the bunch gathered here you wouldnt win against me right even i dont plan on bullying low class devils since i was taking a stroll i came to visit the devils place is the holy demonic sword wielder present i came
to see him even though this was what he said nobody relaxed their posture like we ll believe something a fallen angel says more like your aim is kiba huh if its kiba then he isnt here if youre aiming for kiba then i wont let you do it since kiba attained a rare balance breaker did he plan on making him an offer seri ously since you werent able to win against kokabiel theres no way you can win against me i see the holy demonic sword user isnt present this is boring while scratching his head azazel approached there was no hostility at all because of that it was scary because of the fear my hands were trembling against one of the leaders kokabiel we couldnt do anything if more than that a top level opponent comeseven instant annihilation was possible i dont want to go on to the next world as soon those black wings unfurl if i have to die then at least let me die after doing ecchi things with buchou azazel pointed to a certain tree the vampire hiding over there gasper hiding in the tree shade panicked while approaching gasper the fal len
angel governor said youre the possessor of the forbidden balor view right if you cant use it properly then it will become a thing that causes harm to others as a support type sacred gear if you can supplement the deficient aspects it should b e fine but now that i mention it the research of sacred gears by devils didnt progress much if you invoke it via the five senses while the sacred gears owners capacity is insufficient then it will move naturally and it will be extremely dangerous as if peering into gaspers facemore like azazel was peering into both his eyes gasper himself was trembling as the top head of the fallen angels approached him i think its an obvious reaction however i didnt feel anything strange or an evil malic e from azazel his expression looked like hes full of interest maybe because the others also sensed it they didnt know how to respond looking at him gasper was looking like he was being attacked by the fallen angel but azazel turned around toward s us and pointed to saji while scared saji made a posture as well however is that absorption line if youre practising
try using it connect it to this vampire and if he invokes it while youre absorbing the sacred gears excess it would probab ly run less wildly after azazels explanation saji showed a complex expression as well mmy sacred gear it can suck the power of the opponents sacred gear as well i thought it simply absorbs the opponents power and weakens them hearing that azazel had an amazed expression seriously its because of this that the sacred gear owners recently dont try to know the power of their sacred gears well enough absorption line holds the power of one of the legendary five dragon kings the prison dra gon vritra well this was found out thanks to recent research that thing can connect to any object and can scatter that power if its a short time its possible to separate the line from the owners side and connect it to some other person or object tthen the line on my side for example i can connect it to hyoudou or some other person and then the power will flow into hyoudou yeah if you grow the number of the lines will also increase if you do that the output
of absorption will incre ase many times as well saji became quiet more like about sajis sacred gear if azazels explanation was true then wasnt it quite an amazing thing no no this guy was the governor of the fallen angels you know the boss of the old enemy of t he devils its obvious that hes a bad guy i think that but i didnt feel any hostility after all i worried about what kokabiel saidhis sacred gear collection hobby is abnormal that was what he said was this related to that for improving the sacred gear the fastest way would be to drink the blood of the host of the sekiryuutei if you let a vampire drink blood then theyll gain power well do the rest yourselves the fallen angel governor san said just that much and with a single look tu rned to leave the place however he stopped only once and turned his face towards me sorry for vali our hakuryuukou coming into contact with you on his own accord i am sure you would have been surprised right wh at hes an unusual guy but he does nt think of settling the rivalry between red
and white immediately that was what azazel said but what about you wont you apologise for coming in contact with me repeatedly without informing me about your identity i unconsciously complained as w ell however i was seriously surprised for the client to be the governor of the fallen angels there were limits to even bad jokes but azazel showed a mischievous smile and said a few words well thats my hobby i wont apologise after saying that he left the place we were left behind we exchanged glances and were troubled on how to react but saji after sighing moved for the time being shall i use my sacred gear on the new face kun over there in that state lets try using his sacre d gear and practice in exchange for that next time i will have you help me out with the flower bed on sajis suggestion everyone nodded and gaspers sacred gear training started saji connected the tongue of absorption line to gasper and sucked the excess power as azazel said absorption was possible seriously hes well informed about the sacred gears that governor san after that the volleyball that we threw the moment it came
into gaspers field of vision it got stopped the objects can be only stopped completely for a few minutes interval if it was a ball it was stopped in mid air and stayed like that if it was a living thing its movements were stopped and remained in the same posture the people that got stopped were completely stop ped in that interval to the point of consciousness they didnt have any memory of the interval when they were stopped i experienced it as well so i know i could feel some malice but not to the point of knowing what happened there was no problem with things entering his field of vision but there was no doubt that its a powerful sacred gear the closer you entered his field of vision the longer you got stopped the farther you were the bigger the range of vision was but the time of stoppage got sho rter because gasper was unable to effectively use his sacred gear only certain things within his field of vision could be stopped i feel like that concluded the present situation since it was still impossible for him to invoke it consciously there wer e also
accidental cases when the moment he glanced towards someone a part of their body became lightly stopped seriously pardon me from the unconscious invoking during those times gasper would yell out sorryyyyyyy and try to run away catching him a nd trying to bring him back was troublesome as well it would be good if he would only stop the ball coming in his direction but its very difficult this might bemore difficult than i thought the sacred gears ability was one thing but the training of the owner gasper himself was also difficult however because i was asked by buchou i had to accompany this guy i will make this guy into a magnificent time user that was what i was saying to pump myself up how is it is the practice making progr ess buchou came to see us after making sandwiches for us it seemed like she was worried about gasper after all the person in question was having his power sucked continuously and saying eek eek we ate the sandwiches during rest time kuh the mirac ulous spice does its work and its super tasty buchou its tasty fufufu thanks the ingredients werent a lot so
i was only able to make simple ones even then its really delicious saji also groaned tasty akeno san and kiba who were not here were with sirzechs sama or somewhere buchou was surprised to hear about azazel but she said i hear azazel has substantial knowledge about sacred gears advice about sacred gears maybe he had spare time to give advice to another person for so me reason she started to ponder rias senpais back so i will be going back to my flower bed after taking in two no three sandwiches buchou made in his mouth he said that sajikun thanks for going out of your way to keep my servants company you have my thanks the bastard saji after making buchou say her thanks went red in the face iits alright youre kaichous precious friend and i saw some new possibilities regarding the sacred gear but i have to work on the flower bed as well so saji was a good guy after all he had a bad mouth but he kept us company for quite some time later hyoudou work hard yeah thanks after i said my thanks as well saji left the place after sending
saji off buchou said to gasper who was restin g in the shade of a tree gasper you can still continue on right after getting sucked by saji kun your power has been regulated to a perfect level for the remaining time i will also keep you company in the training ooh buchou this is promising buchou treated her servants preciously after all above all shell properly keep company in the training she was doing it for me even now iill do my besttttttt on buchous voice while exhausted gasper stood up as well alright ill keep him comp any to the end as well today like this gaspers sacred gear practice continued till the night part 3 the night of the next day i was doing my devil work even now i cant teleport via the magic circle to the human clients place but the job itself is going flawlessly the meeting of the top three forces is approaching as well but us servants have to keep on doing our job properly since two maou samas who were at the top of the industry are in the same city we couldnt do our jobs as we please huh its
you today ise kun that is what the young man who is the client tonight morisawa san said in a disappointed manner while dropping his shoulders he was koneko chans customer and my customer as well tonight its my turn morisawa sans gaze suddenly turned downwards it seems he was worried about the object kept on my side a large cardboard box was kept besides me whats that this is a talking cardboard box bam if i kick the cardboard box lightly then you can hear a scream eeeeeeek from the inside yes its gasper the box inhabiting boy since buchou and the rest said to take him alongside for devil jobs for the time being i brought this specially by fastening it on my bicycles back seat and pedalling till here you know i felt like crying to be honest hell only be of use in a subtle way but as long as he doesnt interfere then its all right ill keep the cardboard box here wwhats inside it that is what morisawa san said while having come close before i noticed it suddenly he opened the lid of the cardboard box idiot gasper and morisawa sans eyes met
fue for people with anthropophobia if theyre stared at by people then they become teary eyed right gasper bear with it a bit it appears like a bishoujo by just looking at it but in fact hes a boy he has a hobby of wearing girls clothes i also gave a follow up explanation for the time being if he learns that its a boy beforehand then the damage he gets would be less a s well morisawa san grabbed both of my shoulders strongly and said this cute a kid theres no way it can be a girl its the best that hes a booooooooooooooooooy whats with that insisting voice eh its all right with him being a boy seriousl y his eyes are glittering now come out onii san isnt scary you know lets do fun things together morisawa san talked to gasper with his breath coming out from his nostrils roughly his speech and conduct are that of a pervert uuuuwaaaaaah s ob the person in question gasper was trembling he seemed scared thats natural even i am scared of the morisawa san right now while twitching all five fingers of both hands morisawa sans hands reached
towards gasper nooooooooooooooo gaspe rs scream for a moment my senses got stopped when i realised it the cardboard box next to me had disappeared morisawa san also couldnt understand what had happened to him its the stoppage of time gasper must have gotten excited an d invoked his sacred gear unconsciously me and morisawa san both had our time stopped for a fixed interval surveying the room the cardboard box had moved to the corner you ran over there huh i approached him and talked to the closed cardboard box gasper sorry morisawa san was a bit scary right sob fueeeeee he cried im beaten like this he wouldnt be of use in the job i stopped it again idiot idiot idiot idiot i am an idiot stopping isnt good even though i dont want to stop gasper since you were entrusted to me by buchou i had to do something however once gasper became frightened he wasnt able to do anything me too i couldnt say anything to him at that point part 4 gasper please come out its my fault for pushing you into going with ise buchou was apologizing in front of the door of gaspers
room i thought that if you worked with ise it might be for your benefit as well fueeeeeeeeeeeeeeee gasper who had locked himself in the old schoo l building could be heard crying loudly to the point of dying he hated people he couldnt control his sacred gear and caused trouble to people it seemed his worries are complex no before that morisawa san was scary thats for sure i heard from buc hou gaspers father is from a noble family of vampires but since his mother was a human mistress he wasnt pureblooded i heard they hate those who are non pure bloods even more than devils the vampires scorn those who arent pure bloods so even if i t was their sibling their treatment was discriminatory gasper was bullied by his siblings since childhood even when he went to the human world he was treated as a monster so he had no place he could call home however he possesses the unique abilitie s of vampires and the ability of a human a special sacred gear since he was born with both of them even if he didnt want to as he grew older i heard his powers
would also became greater even if he wanted to become friends with someone if by some c hance his sacred gear got activated it would stop the other person hey ise how would you feel if you could stop time i was asked that by buchou iwould be a bit scared even if i imagined it there were only bad images if i stopped time wh at would i do while my time was stopped what would happen to me it would definitely bug me even if the other person didnt think about it the people who were stopped by gasper must have thought that if suspicion was born once inside the heart then co mpanionship became impossible and they must have started to fear gasper gasper experienced that time and again its the unhappiness that was tasted by those who obtained sacred gears asia was the same as well she went from being called a holy maiden t o being called a witch it seems the sacred gears are a gift from god but i heard that even though god isnt here since the sacred gear program god left was still living and operating the sacred gears wouldnt die
out indeed they were powerful as weapons but corresponding to that they had the power to make the user unhappy as well iidont need such a sacred gear b because i stop everyone i scare them i make them dislike me even i dislike it i dont want to stop my f friends and c comr ades any more of having to look at the faces of my cherished ones stoppedi i dont want that gasper was sobbing inside the room he was chased out of his house as well and gasper wasnt able to live in any world so he was troubled by the roadsi de at that time he was targeted by vampire hunters and lost his life once it seems he was picked up by buchou there however in those days gasper who was endowed with great power couldnt be controlled by buchou and was ordered to be sealed by the higher ups and then his seal was lifted now what a quandary for making this kid to once again shut himself ini am a failure as a king buchou was depressed buchou wasnt wrong gasper wasnt wrong either rather the one who was wrong was me
e ven though they placed their hopes on me and made him accompany me to work i wasnt able to do anything buchou isnt your meeting with sirzechs sama and the others in a short while from now yes but i will extend the time a bit more i have to make sure that gasper is all right first please leave the rest to me i will do something about it buchou couldnt object strongly to my suggestion since the meeting was important as well the bosses of the three great powers were going to assemble that setting was important if something inconvenient occurred on the same day with just that the gap between them might increase much more its all right i finally got a male kouhai i will do something about it that was what i proclaimed while puffing out my chest it was a bluff truthfully i didnt have much confidence this sort of delicate type wasnt my forte but in front of buchou i will make myself look cool ise all right i got it can i count on you yes after hearing my vigorous res ponse buchou nodded with a smile as if feeling regretful
and worried buchou glanced at gaspers room once and left this place after seeing buchou off i took a deep breath and sat in front of the door till you come out i wont move one step from he re i thought of a lot but for me who is an idiot i can only do this sit down plain and simple i think that since ancient times this is the best thing that works against people who shut themselves in probably it was a battle of endurance with that i furiously remained seated for an hour but there was no change there was no sign of him coming out either just sitting quietly like this wasnt going to help huh while feeling that i tried talking to him are you scared of the sac red gearand of us i talked across the door i also possess a sacred gear in which the strongest dragon resides in however my life was not as amazing as yours who was a vampire or like kibas i was a normal male high school student i dont know how much of this will reach him however lets speak about my honest feelings ito be
honest am scared while using the dragons powers i feel that some part of my body is changing into something else i dont know much about devils right now either or about what a dragon is however i feel like i want to proceed further since there wasnt anything else for me why m maybe you may lose something important you know why do you want to live such a straightforward life so much senpai oh he replied thats good hes hearing my story then however that question was troubling no since i am an idiot i dont get the difficult stuff just that just that i dont want to see buchous tears once more during the t ime we did the rating game we all lost i was defeated hollow to the point where i dont have any memories of when i was defeated i was pathetic even then i could only remember buchou crying i closed my fist tightly that timeeven remembering i t now was mortifying it was intense its deeply etched onto the interior of my brain not to mention my comrades kept getting defeated one after another in the end only i remained even now
i see it in my dreams its a dream where i am running around on the battlefield alone i finally found buchou but she was crying and i was unable to do anything giii with a dull sound the door opened up a bit i wasnt present during that time gaspers profile appeared from behind the door a nd he looked like he was earnestly holding back his tears ah i understand i am not blaming you for that but from now on its going to be different right ii will just cause trouble i am a hikikomori i am intensely shyand i cant properl y use my sacred gear as i touched gaspers head i peered into both his eyes his sacred gear was present here huh the ability to stop time i dont hate you as your senpai ill always look after you well as a devil you would be a senpai but in real life i am your senpai so leave it to me gasper blinked in surprise but i continued lend me your power lets support buchou together if youre scared of something then ill send it flying away even if i am like this i
house the legendary dragons power you know i gave out a smile but gasper was troubled by my comment would you like to drink my blood if what that bastard azazel said is true then if you drink my blood you may be able to control your sacred gear that time he said that if it could be done with this then i think its a cheap price would i become a vampire i have heard that if youre a virgin and are bitten by a vampire then you become one but however gasper shook his head horizontally i am scared of drinking blood directly from living beings i am even scared of my own power if anything more happens than this theni will i will yeah you dont like being used by your sacred gear huh however i am jealous of your ability you know gasper showed a surprised expression from the bottom of his heart from just a few words from me eh whats with that reaction did i say something weird because isnt it the best to be able to stop time if i possessed that sacred gear then it would be terrific i would definitely use
it on the class girls no on the schools girls to do indecent things i can affirm this i would be crawling on the corridor and peeking at girls panties i guess ah if its that sacred gear then i wo uld stop b buchou and use it on her b boobs ah just by thinking that i would be able to do as i wish with those boobs my drool isnt stopping thats it a aakeno sans boobs are good too rather peeking at her panties is good too uwah my wild id eas arent stopping wait this isnt the time to be saying such stuff with drool hanging on me aah gasper would definitely be shocked by me and i thought that but he was smiling as if he was happy isesenpai youre a kind person he said tha t with the finest quality smile uh even though hes a male my heart just skipped a beat for a moment this was dangerous its the first time ive been told that i wasnt ever told by people that they were jealous of me not to mention even giving con crete examples ise senpai youre a funny person that
might be true sorry for being a lecher got it listen closely gasper i want to transfer the power of the sekiryuutei onto buchous boobs upon hearing my straightforward feelings gasper let out a surprised expression but gradually his eyes moistened amazing ise senpai while possessing a powerful sacred gear to be able to face forward with indecency that much its a thought process that wont reach me i dont know why but i sen sed a bit of your dreams and your wishes ise senpai your lust is overflowing with courage right hahaha i feel like i am being made fun of maybe its my imagination yeah that must be it its a powerful sacred gear i can use it i will use my sac red gear in order to satisfy my sexual desires i have declared it to the dragon residing in my gauntlet as well ill suck buchous breasts and then as a new objective ill transfer the gift onto buchous breasts no its fine to transfer it to akeno sans boobs as well uwah my dreams are increasingggggggggggg oh not good i unconsciously made a speech fervently and my drool was hanging not good ii also
feel that i got a bit of courage flowing in me in reality its only a bit though goo d good youre a nice kid here look at my right hand i have rubbed buchous breasts with this hand you know gasper looked with astonished eyes onto my right hand upon hearing my speech fufufu this was my prideful story saji also bit on this story i was happy that gasper also bit on this story hes a male after all rreally n no way to be able to touch your master who is a high class devil with ise senpai there are only surprising things occurring also about the story of transfer ring it to boobs its maou samas idea i have thought of following maou sirzechs sama for my entire life that person is amazing hes drawing out my abilities bboob transfer to be able to use the possibilities of the longinus beyond the general d omain maou sama is the strongest after all before i knew it i had entered his room and was conversing deeply with gasper as expected of ise kun to be able to have a friendly chat with gasper immediately while me and
gasper were talking to each o ther unreservedly the one who appeared was kiba he entered the room as if peering into it was he worried as always hes a good guy thats right perfect timing since all the male club members have gathered ill begin my important announcement kiba i have something to talk about what is it ise kun me you and gasper are males thats right but suddenly hearing about that what happened i have thought about an alliance between the male members of the gremory team that hasroused my interest what do you mean oh kiba bit it as well all right lets talk about my plan firstly i gather up power then after transferring it to gasper he will stop the time of the surroundings at that time i will touch the girls who are stoppe d as much as i want you once again thought up some ecchi ideas well thats that but if its just that much then there isnt any duty for me to perform is there upon hearing my plan kiba let out those words lightly but i explained more cal mly no there is you will go into balance breaker
mode and protect me maybe while i am doing ecchi stuff the enemy may attack this is an important cooperation isekun if its for you then ill do anything butlets talk about the future serio usly your method of using your power is too ecchi ddraig will cry you know kiba is a good guy dont say it in a teary voice ddraig since i am your possessor assist me in my erotic ideas kiba you bastard dont look at me with that pitiful loo k you handsome bastard you have it good you can eat girls all you want i cant even eat a single one since its you once you realise it youll be addicted to it buchou and the others seem to pamper you as well so stop what youre saying th ey do say that self realisation is a terrifying thing kiba said something with a profound meaning but meh its all right all right male comrades lets speak frankly first round the best part that you like about a girl first is me i like look ing at girls boobs and legs kiba and gasper were smiling bitterly but werent disliking it but i didnt
miss out the fact that gasper had been shaking his hands from start till end he was scared probably i think not of us but of stopping us he s scared of his time stopping sacred gear which might be invoked at any time from the bottom of his heart of the conclusion which that sacred gear brought about if he stopped the other person hed be hated because of that fear his body and mind were driven into a corner however lets enjoy it even if its for now no i wanted to make him enjoy it sorry but is it all right if i am inside the cardboard box i wont close the lid just when i talk to people i can calm down inside the cardboa rd box that was what gasper said apologetically its regrettable but i allowed it theres no helping it since its the first time forcing him wouldnt be good either lets bring him out of his cardboard box gradually ah this is calming this is it the cardboard box is my hearts oasis is it that much is the cardboard box that comforting for you however this guy the cardboard box suited
him more like i was used to seeing him inside it the cardboard box vampire since its an extremely new development i was troubled on how to react if you dislike meeting eye to eye with people that much then how about this i made two holes in a paper bag kept in the room and placed it on top of gaspers head tthis is the cross dressing young boy wore a paper bag on his head in the dimly lit room a red glint made by his eyes was coming from the part where i had opened holes hhow is it does it suit me hes sluggishly coming closer to the path of a zombie what intensity n o matter how you look at it its a degenerate i am seriously scared ah but this its good right it may suit me gasper for the first time i have felt that youre amazing rreally if i wear this then my value as a vampire may increase yeah more than a vampire its a pervert at full power i am beaten these people around me are all weird like this the indecent talk of males only through the night began
i knew it but kiba was surprisingly a lecher himself part 5 the next day i was headed to a certain place i was called by akeno san more like buchou said that once she also finished her work shed come later what work was it the first things that came to mind were ecchi delusions but since buchou was also coming later that possibility was nil i who was in between them was happy but its complicated with something as an impetus it seems it would turn into a big fight a struggle for me who is a pet i was getting more than i deserved as a pet it was complicated as a man though i continued to walk out of the city wait there is only one important thing ahead yes it was the shrine uwaaah wasnt a shrine a bad place for us devils i still havent stepped inside a shrine but i had heard that you cant ente r that place easily more like i felt like i had heard from buchou about it in the places not to enter while thinking that my eyes caught the shadow of a human on the stone steps
straining my eyes and looking it was the face of a person i recognised welcome ise kun ah akeno san it was the figure of akeno san clad in a shrine maidens outfit while i was climbing the steps akeno san who was moving forward said it without stopping sorry for suddenly calling you out like this ise kun ah its no problem i was also free with no work but what kind of work is this and also buchou said she will also come later yes i know rias has to do a final meeting with sirzechs sama regarding the conference matter no but akeno sans shrine maiden outfit was the best it suited her pretty good shes surely a yamato nadeshiko 15 perhaps her other name the priestess of thunder came from here more like was it fine for devils to be in a shrine my questions werent running out but why was akeno san over here is it all right not going to the meeting along with buchou i was thinking that the queens power may be required grayfia sama will follow up over there not to mention that if it advances by a certain degree then
even without me it will be all right more than that i have to meet the person whos waiting upstair s that was what akeno san said and looked far off up the stairs huh was someone coming the arch drew nearer if devils tried to cross this then they would receive damage they said not to come close to a shrine but this place is fine an agreement was reached under the table so even devils can enter while saying that akeno san passed through the archway without anything happening ooh so its all right huh i also fearfully passed through ah its seriously all right in front of my eyes there was a splendid main shrine present i sensed oldness but there didnt appear to be any damaged parts at all akeno san do you live here yeah the priest of the last generation passed away so rias secured this shrine which had no people remaining for me is he the sekiryuutei i became aware of a third persons voice turning to that side the person there was golden coloured wings to the point of dazzling were fluttering in front of me a young man with a handsome
face was sendin g glances at me his body was wrapped in an extravagant white robe and above his head a golden coloured halo was floating wait a halo the young man gave a gentle looking smile and came for a handshake nice to meet you sekiryuutei hyoudou issei kun he knows my name who is he sensing my doubt in front of my eyes twelve wings appeared from the young mans back i am michael i am the leader of the angels i see judging from this auras quality its surely ddraig this brings back memories its a super big shot part 6 with akeno san leading me and michael san headed to the main shrine a halo was the proof of an angel i heard this from buchou before for angels their identifying features are the halos above their heads and their white feathers while the fallen angels features are their lack of halos and their black wings michael san had golden wings he had the aura of a big person floating around him inside the quite large main shrine there were a number of huge pillars fr om the centre i felt an unknown surge of power
that tingled my skin this aura what was it it was full of danger signals truth is i thought of awarding you this huh will he be giving me something i sent my gaze towards the direction michael san w as pointing at with his fingers over there a sword was floating while oozing out a holy aura uwah this must be a holy sword even the ignorant me knows this surge very well since i have come to see excalibur and durandal i know what a holy aura me ans this is georgesif i say saint george then would it be better introduced its the dragon slayer holy sword that he possessed ascalon no i dont know anything about any george or saint george at all you know its a famous dragon slayer we ll you should also study a bit more shut up and whats up with that dragon slayer doesnt it have a dangerous smell just from the name itself dragon slayers are a group of people who made slaying dragons their joband its also the term used for the weapons they used assassins specialising in dragons huh scary does that mean i am also a target
i dislike this more and more as a special courtesy since i am giving you this even you a devil who has the power of the dragon can handle it before you can possess it do you think you can assimilate it into the boosted gear that is what michael san is saying but is it possible it depends on you the sacred gear responds to your feelings if you wish for it it should be possible is that so yeah how should i do it more like listen to my question why give it to me no matter how much i thought i asked him that why was this seemingly valuable thing being given to me i was the old enemy for the angels not to mention i was housing the dragon who caused trouble during the war a long time ago i thought i was the worst existence for them michael san answered while smiling during this times meeting i think theres a huge opportunity to cooperate between the three great powers i hear you already know it so i am saying this but we lost our creator god during the last war our enemies also lost the
old maous in battle the leaders of the fallen angels are reticent azazel also has his official stand of not wanting to crea te wars this is a chance to get rid of the useless battles if small scale battles continue like this intermittently then anyhow the three great powers will be destroyed even if that isnt the case other powers may invade from the side that sword is a present from me to the maou side of course i also sent presents to the fallen angel side i got the rumoured holy demonic swords from the devil side as well so our side is very grateful as well haa michael san was saying quite difficult things the general meaning was that this times meeting was important and that he wanted to make peace with us devils and fallen angels however other powers whats with that was there something else besides the three great powers about that other than powers written in the holy scriptures other mythological systems exist as well whats that ddraig thats the first time i have heard of that ordinarily they dont walk over from their territory since an implicit anti war agreement was present howe
ver we dont know if the others will move when they find out that the god of the holy scriptures has died this talk is also about making sure that the three great powers dont utter the non existence of the god of the holy scriptures outside i d idnt get it i didnt get what ddraig was saying at all my mind was full of questions i didnt know about the deep internal conditions between the devils angels and fallen angels you know michael san continued on his talk to me whose questions weren t answered we heard that the one who opposed us the welsh dragon had become a devil as a greeting and alongside that as a present were giving you this sword from now on youll probably be targeted by dragon class opponents and the vanishing drago n i thought that for the rumoured weakest host in history it may become a supporting weapon sorry for being the weakest even like this i am working hard you know its all things i dont know but i understood that hes giving me this sword no b ut why me is giving it to me all right more
like why me only once have the three great powers held hands together thats during the time they defeated the red and white dragon since it was the two dragons who trespassed into our battlefield and th rew the battlefield into disarray i have heard that story from ddraig before and so master ddraig hes saying something who knows so youll play dumb huh meh its all right wishing that we hold hands together like that time i am placing m y hopes in you in the sekiryuutei its typical japanese behavior right i thought of something butsince the top of the angels was saying it with a smile on his face ill believe it is the truth i turned myself towards the aforementioned sword bu t can i touch it isnt a holy sword dangerous for devils not to mention isnt it the worst case for it to be a dragon slayer akeno san said to me who was having difficulty in extending his hand there were final adjustments done on that sword in thi s shrine maou sama azazel sama and michael samas camps ceremonies have been performed so even if a devil houses the power of the
dragon he can touch it seriously if akeno san says it then it must be true if its akeno san saying it then i can b elieve it i fearfully took the holy sword floating in midair in my hand nothing happened i feel the holy aura but no damage or bad power is flowing into me it seriously seems fine partner focus your consciousness on the boosted gear ill follow up after that try making the sword in your hand combine with the surge of the sacred gear you say that but even if i am told that for the time being i focused on invoking my sacred gear making the red gauntlet appear i tried combining the surge of boosted gear with the surge of the holy sword in my hand the holy aura flowed into the sacred gear it passed through the sacred gear and the sensation of a bad surge flowed into my body butslowly it became familiar and a sensation as if it was being taken in by ddraigs power attacked me kah after a red flash a gauntlet with a blade growing out of the front portion of the back of my left hand
could be seen it seriously combined amazing the sacred gear and the holy sword integrated the holy sword grew out of the boosted gear after confirming it michael san clapped his hands and with that its time i have to go soon huh youre already leaving ah there was something i wanted to say if i ever met the angel side uum iwant to say something to you its time to visit the conference hall so lets hear it after the conference ill definitely hear it dont worry after saying that michael sans whole body was wrapped by light after a momentary flash of a light the big shot of the angels disappeared from this place part 7 heres some tea ah thanks a lot we were in the shrine after michael san left i was intruding on the grounds that akeno san lives in after passing through a japanese style room i was h aving tea in a room that looked like a tea ceremony room if i remembered correctly you drink it after turning the cup three times right one time two times three times its bitter akeno san was looking at my reaction and was laughing with
a low voic e did akeno san work with michaelsan on the sword present here yes the specific modification ceremony for ascalon was held in this shrine the setting of the three great powers conference and also this sword buchou and akeno sans work was qui te a lot and had to be hectic was this the mission of the king and queen i had to work so that i didnt get in their way and be the partner of gasper like i was asked we were finally alone lets try asking akeno san about the things i wanted to as k while were like this i prepared myself and asked about the thing i had been worried about since the battle with kokabiel can i ask one question yes of course are you the daughter of one of the fallen angels leaders on my question ake nosans expression changed to a slightly cloudy one thats right originally i was born between the leader of the fallen angels baraqiel and a human so its true after all kokabiel did say to akeno san the one having the power of baraqiel akeno san stared at me and talked my mother was
a daughter of a certain shrine of this country i heard that on a certain day my mother saved baraqiel who had collapsed from injuries and from the fate of that day i was born was that the case aken osan had complicated household conditions somehow my house is too normal huh uh i asked her myself but now i was troubled over how to respond while i was searching my brain on what words to say next akeno san expanded her wings from her back different from the usual two wings of devils one wing was that of a devil while the other one was the black wing of a fallen angel theyre dirty wings the wing of a devil and the wing of a fallen angel i possess both of them as if despising the bl ack feathers of fallen angels she grabbed them with her hand while hating these feathers i met rias and became a devil but what was born were the wings of a fallen angel and devil a more disgusting creature who possessed both fufufu this may sui t me who has dirtied blood flowing in her veins akeno san was in self derision
no way akeno san please dont say that how do you feel after hearing that ise kun you hate fallen angels right they killed you and asia chan once and tried to destroy this city once theres no way you can hold good thoughts about them i said whats in my heart clearly since i felt lying wouldnt be good yes i hate fallen angels upon hearing that akeno sans expression seemed to become sad however wit hout caring i continued on speaking buti like akeno san akeno san had a surprised expression at my statement i wont ask for any more details about your birth i only wanted to confirm it so actually i am thinking i asked a bad thing so i am regretting it now i am really sorry i have insensitive points so thats not the case i have the blood of a fallen angel in me you know can you forgive me although i reincarnated into a devil the fact that i have the blood of a fallen angel in me doesnt change i may have approached you wanting to get hated you know no thats definitely the case i am the worst kind of
woman it has no relation ah how do i say it akeno san youre a kind senpai no um i definitely ha te fallen angels but i think that akeno san is different even if you have the blood of fallen angels in you akeno san is akeno san and you are the vice president of the occult research club i have never once had thoughts of dislike towards akeno san even after hearing that akeno san has the blood of fallen angels i can not come to hate you i like you even now so theres no problem right huh what the hell am i saying sorry no more sensitive words are coming to me upon hearing my words akeno san wascrying not good did i somehow hurt her w what should i do i made a girl cry however akeno san floated out a smile and wiped her tears you said some killing words after hearing thatwont i really get serious huh i didnt hear the second half clearly but my words were killing words did i maybe say something bad after akeno san got up she came towards meand clung to me aakeno san akeno san whispered
in my ear who was troubled on how to react i have decide d i have decided ise kun do you like rias eh u um y yes of course i like her thats a given right shes serious as well so legal wife is impossible theres a possibility of asia chan being the legal wife as well sothe first and sec ond position cant be shaken i guess first position second position what ranking would this be for to me who had questions controlling my face akeno san spoke while clinging to me wait akeno san i wont be able to hold it if you do too stimula tive things to your junior hey ise kun yyes i wont mind being third position third position tthird position was this connected to the first and second position of before i i dont get it yes third position i think its a comparati vely good position above all theres the feeling of unfaithfulness so itll be burning ufufu ise kun is it fine if i spoil you more ill even give you lap pillow instead of buchou its all words whose meaning i didnt understand but i at least got the
part about the lap pillow eh r really are you serious a akeno sans lap pillow uwaaaah just by imagining it my excitement isnt dying hey ise kun can you call me akeno eh i cant call my senpai in that overly familiar way then just once is fine please if i am asked with those bleary eyes then i swallowed in my spit and murmured it after deciding aakeno i am happy ise gyu she hugged me further uwah that voice right now it wasnt the usual akeno sans dignified ara ara ufufu but the voice of a normal girl it was a voice as if fawning over someone shes not the vice president himejima akeno but she became a normal female high schooler that did something to my brain more like aken osan was cuuuuuuuuute wait this feeling of boobs pressing on me akeno san was soft as expected like that i was lead onto akeno sans laps the preparations for a lap pillow uooooooooooooh to think i would have a third time in my life since it was the beloved akeno san its an inexpressible feeling akeno san pat my head its a different feeling from buchou
too ufufufu i stole one of riass special rights somehow i feel like i am doing something bad ise kun does it feel good yyes its the best ah akeno sans thighs are soft as well its the best sleeping place um i wonder what it is butif this scene is seen by buchou what aboutbuchou hey ise this voice is i felt like my body had frozen in an instant i brought my body up from that place and stiffly turned my head backwards and there my master who was emitting the worst possible expanding crimson aura was standing like the two guardian deva kings ill be killed i intuitively thought and felt that because no matter how you look at it shes wearing the power of destruction bbbbubububuchou t this is um buchou pressed her hand on her forehead and let out a huge sigh theres no unpreparedness or chink to have a lap pillow from a lap o ther than mine zun zun feeling anger in her footsteps buchou approached me munzu it hurts my cheeks are being pulled by buchou as hard as she can ooooooouch buchou asked me in a low intensity voice what about
the sword ii got it what about michael hhe left then theres no business left here were going back i hurriedly followed buchou who had turned on her heels i bowed to akeno san sorry really i am really jealous of the number one candidate rias buchou akeno san m urmured something from behind it had returned to the voice of the usual akeno san i didnt hear it properly but buchou stopped for a while then started pulling my arm and left its like she wanted to quickly get me away from this place part 8 tap tap tap tap tap the sound of buchous footsteps descending the shrines stone steps were full of anger i who was following behind her said nothing and just tried not to be left behind buchou hated her servant me to be touched by other girls it se ems asia and koneko chan are ok but girls other than that even if its akeno san she hated it no since its akeno san whos closest to her she hated it no i didnt get my masters heart about that but if you looked at it from my master buchous perspective it might look
like betrayal what should i do theres no way other than to apologise but how do i apologise i really dont get it if i am hated by buchou then ill die of sadness i am thinking of this and that with my small brain su ddenly buchou stopped without turning towards me buchou asked hey ise what will she ask i am scared how should i answer her i cant find an answer yyes however i didnt expect buchous words akeno isakeno yes akeno is the fu kubuchou16 however she is akenoand i am huh what do you mean i think akeno san is akeno san but thats why buchou is buchouam i wrong when i answered buchou i felt that buchou shrugged her shoulders thats right i am buchou but also rias wwhat was it her tone was really despondent did i say something wrong not being able to find the answer buchou wanted i responded normally yes buchou is my master and a high class devil rias gremoryum buchou turning back her expression seemed very sad whats with that number one candidate am i not the only one whos far off that voice w asnt the usual
buchous voice brimming with elegance but a normalgirls voice found anywhere grigori1 azazel do i have to attend tomorrows conference as well of course vali since youre the hakuryuukou hey azazel are wars not going to occur any more you just seek battle you sure got attached to an ideal dragon youre the type that wont live long thats fine i dont have any interest in living long its just i regret being born in this age a world witho ut god i wanted to try defeating god thats really like the hakuryuukou and after defeating all the strong guys what will you do ill die i dont have any interest in such a boring world life4 the vip conference begins part 1 early morning me and gasper were doing time stopping training in the forest surrounding the old school building guuuuu ise senpai i i am tireeeeed gasper was rubbing his eyes dont let out a weak voice we have to fulfil our dreams without minding i kept on throwing the balls isesan here are the balls asia who was accompanying us early in the morning was passing on the balls to me as usual it was a training
where i threw the ball to gasper and he stopped it mid air he was now able to succeed once every twenty times persistence paid off compared to the first time it was quite a huge progress i had to somehow make him be able to use his sacred gear if i didnt then my objective wouldnt be fulfilled i wanted to make hi m be able to use time stoppage at will as soon as possible and touch the stopped girls bodies the schools girls good value had been determined i had already made the schedule for the place to stop time and the time period was made to be a minute i also knew the time when they were alone all thats left was to stop only stopping you knoooooooow by the way the target girls were all school beauties with big racks after all since i was stopping them then it would be girls with big boobs after p racticing with him i couldnt sleep at night not being able to stop my delusions of time stopping i was worrying endlessly through the day even if asia and buchou were sleeping besides me that was that and
this was this in reality i wanted to hug b uchou from behind and rub her boobs butit seemed asia would get mad at me more like the following day after that incident buchou wasnt listening to me till after school looking as if she was pondering over something thinking that i was truly ha ted by her i was sad from the bottom of my heart after that without incident she returned to the usual buchou but i only made buchou sad huh i felt some discomfort in my arm only my arm was unable to move somehow it seemed gasper accidentally sto pped my arm eeek s sorryyyyyy he leaned on the ground and curled up i said it while smiling bitterly thats why didnt i say not to mind it even if you stop me were in the middle of training and youre a novice so its fine well if my whole body gets stopped then ill be in trouble the number of times that occurred has also gone down right lets continue this pace without challenging gasper i followed up however gasper said with a complicated expression ssince i am incomplete both as a human who
has a sacred gear and as a vampire as well i only cause trouble to everyone i i have to control my power more w what a half way incomplete existence i am sob aah he cried again thinking about it both he and akeno san were halves born from different species feeling doubt in their own existence they probably hated their existence it was something deep that was difficult to understand but i knew at least that these two were burdened with something all the time and because of that they were probably suffering however i gasper i like you dont mind it before you start brooding come strike me if you think youll lose i also dont know much about that so its fine i could only say that my true thought s no matter what akeno sans true identity was no matter who gasper was i didnt have any reason to hate them w well gasper was a bit hesitant and was irritating at times but i didnt hate him were both members of the same club and also rias buch ous servants and comrades come at me with a bang i said it like usual while
puffing out my chest i couldnt say anything that worked on the heart but no matter what i think it was best to say it if i became uneasy then this guy would become no good i was that guys senior i had to guide him well as a devil he was the senior though seeing that gasper wiped his tears and stood up isesenpai i ill do my best yeah till school starts ill be throwing one hundred balls understood ththen ill wear this paper bag and do a power up stop it if asia sees that shell cry asia and gasper both let out questioning looks i wont ever show the paper bag wearing gasper to asia i am alright with being overprotective do your best isesan gasper kun gasper since the bishoujo asia senpai is cheering you on as well cheer up yyesssss thank you very much asia senpaiiiiii like this we resumed practice gasper lets do it together and then well stop girls however i t hought something a masteri wanted a person who would be our teacher being an expert in sacred gears and furthermore knowledgeable about dragons wasnt there a person like that unexpectedly
the black winged man came into my mind buti immediate ly shook my head sideways and renewed my thoughts no way that person was our bitter enemy however i think his knowledge was the real deal if there was a teacher then wed definitely become stronger as well part 2 now then were leaving everyone from the occult research club had gathered in the club room we nodded to buchous words thats right today was the day of the conference of the three great powers the day had finally arrived the location will be the staff meeting room of kuoh aca demys new school buildings todays a holiday the time was late at night it seemed each factions top were on standby in the new buildings lounge already also above all this school was enveloped completely by a strong barrier so no one was able to enter of course till the meeting was over no one could exit as well outside the barrier angels fallen angels and devil troops were surrounding the whole school looking at the atmosphere which seemed like a critical situation kiba said if by an y chance something happens in todays conference and it breaks down
this place might become a battlefield sscary its become something amazing the sense of reality wasnt quite strong but its an important day i have to be proper as well we foll owed buchou out of the club room bbuchou e everyoneeeeeeeee the cardboard box was left in the room of course the hikikomori vampire was inside it gasper todays conference is important so since you can not control your time stopping sacred gear you cant participate you know that was what buchou informed gently indeed if gasper who couldnt control his sacred gear even now hindered everyone present in the meeting due to some shock it would become terrible due to this this guy will be w atching over the club room gasper be a good boy okay yyes ise senpai i have left my portable game in the club room so you can play with that there are sweets as well so you can have them too i have left the paper bag as well so if you be come lonely wear it to your hearts content yyessssss good i nodded and followed buchou who had left the room kiba murmured to me while smiling isekun youre caring
after all leave it to me i will do something about this single male kouha i of mine i said that while brimming with confidence but that was a bluff i was uneasy about how long i could do even this even then i wanted to do something for gasper part 3 knock knock buchou knocked on the meeting rooms door excuse us buchou opened the door and there wasa gorgeous and pompous looking table and as if surrounding it people who i recognised were sitting the air was enveloped by quietness and everyone had a serious face gulp i also swallowed my spit due to the fee ling of nervousness asia also grabbed the end of my clothes as if feeling uneasy i lightly clasped her hand to ease her from the devil side there were sirzechs sama and leviathan sama ah the waitress was grayfia san she was on standby beside the tea preparing cart from the angels side there were the golden feathered michael san and a unknown girl angel san normal angels have white wings after all more like she was an amazing beauty the beauty surely was angel class ah shes an angel huh fr
om the fallen angels side there were azazel with his twelve wings unfurled and the vanishing dragon vali glancing at me the ends of azazels lips rose as if happily ooh today he wasnt wearing a yukata but a black robe elaborated with ornaments a s expected he wouldnt be wearing a yukata in this place sirzechs sama and leviathan sama were wearing clothes with ornaments decorating them as well my younger sister and her family sirzechs sama introduced buchou to the vip of the other factions b uchou also bowed they were active during kokabiels attack a few days ago i have heard the report i give you my thanks once more michael san gave his thanks to buchou buchou conducted herself coolly and bowed once more sorry that kokabiel of my side caused you trouble azazel said it with a brazen expression what an attitude buchous mouth also twitched sit on the seats over there following sirzechs samas direction grayfia san urged us to the chairs near the wall sona kaichou was alread y sitting on one of those seats buchou sat besides kaichou she made me sit beside her and after that akeno san kiba asia xenovia
and koneko chan sat in turn after confirming that sirzechs sama said now that everyone has arrived ill say the pre conditions for the meeting the people present here acknowledge the most important event and forbidden subject ie the non existence of god huh kaichou knew about it as well i glanced towards kaichou but she didnt have a particularly surprised expre ssion was she informed about it beforehand by buchou or her onee san leviathan sama as if it were ordinary grayfia san looked like she knew about it as well then acknowledging that lets continue the conversation like this with sirzechs samas s entence the conference between the three great powers began the conference was progressing smoothly like that we angels michael san said that thats true that way would be better if its like now certainly the three great powers will go down the road of destruction sirzechs sama also said that well we dont have any particular thing to fuss over there were instances when this place would freeze when azazel said a sentence occasionally as well but i thought that the governor of the fall en angels was purposely making that atmosphere and enjoying it
ooh the vips were doing a fastidious conversation but honestly the subject was jargon to me since my devil history was too shallow i didnt know whats happening devils angels fallen a ngels it might be a valuable conversation for them but i didnt understand it at all no no matter whats occurring it would be better to keep my mind here but my brain couldnt process these things yeahsince i couldnt help it i looked at buch ous boobs who was beside me aah buchous boobs they sure were big my body knew their feeling so i should soon know their taste as well butstepping up was considerably difficult buchou realised my gaze on her breasts and let out a bitter smile she took my hand and clasped it buchous hands were shaking a little was she nervous having to participate in this important meeting and having to give a report as well it might be natural even buchou would be nervous since it seems its being said that this conference might be written down in history i also clasped buchous hands without saying anything buchou if this was alright with you then ill lend you my strength any
time ara ara buchou and ise kun are acting lovey dovey in the middle of the conference akeno san said it with a small voice while smiling i am drawing courage from ises hands this is the most effective after all buchou its an honour if my courage is all right with you then take it as much as you want mor e like before i knew it buchou and akeno san had made up so thats good woah i was going to stroke her breasts the conference continued and it was finally buchous turn now then rias could you speak about the incident a few days before yes l ucifer sama after being urged by sirzechs sama buchou kaichou and akeno san stood up they talked about a part continuously about the recent attack from kokabiel and everyone belonging to the three great powers continued to hear about it buchou talk ed about the summary of the incident she experienced herself plainly in a calm manner maybe due to maximum level nervousness those hands were shaking after all due to her speech something with the three great powers might change no matter how courageo us buchou was this places
atmosphere would be very painful besides buchou was around the same age as meand a girl each of the factions vips who heard the report were either letting out a sigh scowling or smiling each person had a different reac tion that is all regarding the report of the events which i rias gremory and the household devils over there experienced buchou who had said everything had finally resumed seating upon hearing sirzechs samas good work sit down good work bu chou thanks rias chan leviathan sama also sent a wink towards buchou now then azazel after hearing this report i want to hear the opinion of the governor of the fallen angels upon sirzechs samas questioning everyones gaze concentrated on th e black haired governor azazel started talking after letting out an intrepid smile regarding the incident a few days back kokabiel a leader of our central organisation grigori kept quiet to the other leaders as well as to me the governor and acte d independently he was disposed of by vali after that his punishment was enforced by the organisations court martial his punishment is eternal freezing in cocytus he cant come out anymore the explanation for that
everything was written in the mate rial that was forwarded to you right that is all michael san said while sighing as for the explanation it is the worst category buti know about the story of you personally not wanting to make anything big occur against us is that true aah i dont have any interest in wars when kokabiel also disparaged me dont you have the report for that as well yes as azazel said kokabiel said quite a lot of bad stuff about his bosses he was a person who was passive about wars and only had an inter est in sacred gears this time sirzechs sama asked azazel azazel i want to ask one thing why have you been gathering owners of sacred gears for the past decades at first i thought you were gathering humans and attempting to augment your battle pot ential i even anticipated you waging war against heaven or us but yes no matter how much time passed you didnt wage a war against us when i heard you got hold of the vanishing dragon i was enveloped by a strong wariness michael sans opinion was the same as sirzechs samas upon hearing
the twos opinion azazel smiled bitterly its for the sake of sacred gear research if thats the case should i send a part of the research materials to you as well even if i did research i wouldnt wage a war against you or anything i dont have any interest in war at this late of an hour i am perfectly satisfied with the world right now i have strongly ordered my subordinates dont interfere with the human worlds politics you know i have no intention of intervening in religion either or influencing the business of the devils damn is my trust in the three factions the least thats true thats right thats exactly it sirzechs samas michael sans and leviathan samas opinion coincid ed how far is he not trusted the governor of the fallen angels upon hearing that azazel disinterestedly pecked at his ears che i thought you were better than god or the last generations lucifer but you guys are troublesome guys yourselves snea kily researching doesnt get along well with you huh ah i got it then lets make peace originally wasnt that the intention of you angels and devils as well peace wait doesnt that
mean they desire peace together on azazels sentence each faction was surprised for a small interval buchou beside me and even kaichou besides her were considerably surprised it seems like azazels peace speech was quite a thing to be surprised at it seemed it was considered unlikely to be presented by him well even to me who was not informed about the situation i think if the boss of one of the powers proposed that then its an amazing thing maybe i was witnessing a historical moment michael san who was surprised by azazels proposal smiled yes i also planned to propose peace to the devil side and grigori even if we continue the relationship of the three factions like before then it will become damaging to the world right now i the leader of the angels say it sincethe original cause of th e war god and maou sama have been annihilated michael san said that he wanted peace in this interval azazel burst out laughing on michael sans words ha that stubborn michael has finally started to speak even though he was all about god god god before i have lost a lot of things however theres no
point seeking for things that arent present it is our duty to guide humans we members of the seraph have the same opinion that the most important thing is to watch over the children of god from now on as well and to guide them hey hey with your speech just now youll fall you know i thought that but you took over the system right its become a good world its completely different from the time when we fell somehow due to all those special terms i didnt get it but it seemed like an advanced dimensions joke sirzechs sama also shared the same opinion we are the same even if the maou arent here in order to continue the species devils too have moved forward as well even we wouldnt want war if we start another war the devils will be destroyed on sirzechs samas words azazel nodded as well yes if we start another war the three factions will definitely be mutually destroyed and then it will affect the human world as well and the world will end we cant do wars now some time ago azazel had a joking mood but its done a complete change
and he has a serious expression now do you think a world without god is wrong do you think a world without god would d ecay i am sorry to say but that isnt the case me and you as well are both healthily living like this azazel said that while opening his arms the world moves even without god i felt that i somehow understood only those words even without god i lived in this world i feel that other peoples lives dont have a particular change either in between all the difficult talk i sensed that azazels words the world moves even without god were engraved strongly in my brain after that the conversat ion moved to hereafters war potential etc for some reason the current military forces and each factions interaction they are talking about the power picture from now on compared to some time ago the feeling of nervousness had been reduced maybe the y understood that no power wants war and is this it on sirzechs samas sentence the vips let out a huge sigh somehow or other it seems the usual important conversation was finished had it been around maybe one hour since the
conference began i t sure feels long i am bad at such long things its more fun to move around while grayfia san was serving tea as the waitress michael san turned his gaze towards me now then since the discussion has considerably been moving in a good direction is i t all right if we hear about the matter of sekiryuutei dono everyones gaze concentrated towards me owah w wont i be nervous more like he properly remembered about the recent thing at the shrine as expected of the leader of the angels the thing th at i wanted to ask michael san i turned my head towards asia and prepared myself before coming here i had received asias prior confirmation asia is it all right if i ask michael san about you asia was surprised but she consented if ise san w ants to ask about it then i dont mind i trust ise san while smiling asia gave permission thats why i have to ask him why did you exile asia on my question to michael san everyone had the astonished expression probably thinking why is he talking about it now sorry however no matter what i
wanted to ask the angel side about it once asia who trusted god that much why was she exiled from the church other than the fallen angels who killed asia i felt there were unforgivable parts to th e angel side as well michael san replied in an earnest manner i can only apologise for that after god was annihilated only the system to govern divine protection mercy and miracles remained this system is if i explain it simply the system to pe rform the miracles etc god did god made the system and used it to bring about miracles above ground to bring about the effect of holy things like exorcism crosses etc these too are the systems powers i see the damage we devils take when we touch a cross is the effect of the system huh lets try to hit the boss of the angels with more questions after god diedsome system trouble occurredis what youre saying on my question michael san nodded to be honest it takes a big toll on anyone who uses it with the exception of god with me as the centre everyone of the seraph was able to somehow start up the
system butcompared to the time god existed the divine protection and mercy to those who believe in god is not complete its an unfor tunate thing but those who can be granted salvation are limited now that you mention it kokabiel might have said it as well something about since god isnt here theres a limit to how many people can be saved for that there was a need to keep away those people related to the church who could possibly cause an influence on the system as an example of those who can influence the system a part of the sacred gears like asia argentos twilight healing is included as well your boosted gear and also divine dividing as well asia is included because she can heal devils and fallen angels as well on my question michael san once again nodded yes if there is a person who can heal devils and fallen angels present within the followers it will influence the faith of the ones around her the source of us living in heaven is the faith of believers because of that twilight healing is a forbidden sacred gear which can cause an influence on the system and
also as an example of influence on the system xenovia interrupted michael san and continued the people who know about the non existence of god right yes thats right xenovia to lose you is a serious wound even for us but if apart from us seraph and a part of the higher rank angels a fair amount of people who know about the non existence of god approach a place with a direct connection then theres a huge effect on the system i apologise there was no other way but to make you and asia argento heretics michael san bowed his head to asia and xenovia ooh the top of the angels was apologizing to asia and xenovia the two in question also stared in wonder indeed theyd be troubled on how to respond however xenovia immediately shook her neck sideways and smiled no michael sama please dont apologise even like this till i reached this age i was brought up by the church i somehow felt it was a bit irrational but if you know the reason then theres nothing such as asking why the fact that you reincarnated as a devil that is our crime its all right
i regretted it a bit but the things that i couldnt do when i was serving the church the things that were sealed from me are now brilliantly colouring my everyday life if i say these words i may anger the other believers buteven then i am satisfied by my current life xenovia thought that way of her life with us theres also the part of her being a bit too otherworldly but she isnt a bad girl asia also said it wi th her hands together michael sama i also feel i am happy since i now have a lot of important people and also i have met and talked with the michael sama who i admired so its an honour on asias and xenovias words michael san showed an expressi on of relief sorry i am grateful for your forgiving hearts i leave durandal to you xenovia since its the family of sirzechs sister then i am at ease that it wont be used by those who do as they please azazel was looking at asia asia also notic ed it and her body trembled it seems my subordinates killed her while keeping quiet about it i received
that report as well i said it to azazel clearly thats right asia died once e even i was killed by fallen angels but above that asia it may be something that occurred in a place you dont know but the fallen angel girls who admired you killed asia for your sake i know that i have no right to say anything in this conference what happened earlier was michael sans measure right now its c ompletely from my own personal grudge buchou is also trying to warn me by saying calm down ise sorry buchou but no matter what i have to its true we fallen angels are eliminating those sacred gear users who may cause harm to us as an organisa tion its obvious right sensing that a person may become a threat in the future then if we know about it beforehand youll want to eliminate him and because of that you died the reason is that the human with no talent you could have run wild with the power of the sekiryuutei without being able to control it and have a bad effect on us or the world thanks to you i am a devil do
you dislike it at the very least those around you are happy that you became a devil its true that buchou sirz echs sama and my comrades too are happy that i became a devil as azazel said if ddraigs power would have been with a me who remained a human then i dont know what wouldve happened even after becoming a devil i cant control it properly but if it w as when i was alive then it would have been bad ii dont dislike it everyone is a good person and i know that i am receiving favourable treatment however even if i apologise now its too late thats why i am thinking of doing something that on ly i can do to make you stand on both your legs i dont understand azazels true intentions what does he mean now then its time we hear the opinion of people other than us those who seem like they can influence the world the invincible dragon samas first vali what do you want to do to the world on azazels question the hakuryuukou vali smiled if i can fight strong guys then its fine are you alright with that
reply you you seriously only like combat that seems like a nuisance t o others though azazels gaze turned to me next then sekiryuutei what about you even if you ask that i replied while scratching my cheeks to be honest i dont understand it well somehow due to all the fastidious stuff my head is in chaos in addition to that i am desperate about looking after my junior devil so even if i am told what i think about the world how should i say it i dont have feelings gushing forth its my honest thoughts even if i am asked what i think about the world i dont quite have any feelings about it however you are one of those who has the power to move the world if you dont make your choice then it will be difficult for those standing on top of each of the powers such as me to move even if i am told t hat by azazel i am troubled hyoudou issei let me explain it in a very simple manner if we fight then there will be a need for you to also fight at the front stage if that
happens you wont be able to sleep with rias gremory wwhatdid yo usay if we make peace then there wont be a need to fight if that happens then whats left that is the most important is continuation of the species and prosperity you may be able to endeavour in making children with rias gremory everyday hows t hat is it easy to understand if theres a fight then theres no sex if theres peace then you can have sex all the time which will you choose for the first time i understood azazels language from the bottom of my heart i see if theres peace th en i can do ecchi things with buchou all the time no can i do ecchi things with buchou was i in that position however if peace continues then ill someday be able to do ecchi things with buchou that wish is huge i would like to have the peaceful o ne please yes its peace all right peace is the best i want to do ecchi things with buchou i said my desires as they were i didnt mind buchou who was beside me buchou her face was completely flushed isekun sirzechs
sama is present here you know kiba said it with an oh boy and a bitter smile ah thats right sirzechs sama laughed in a low intensity manner this is bad i have to hurry up and give an excuse i have to give a serious story um i since i am an idiot the meaning of ninety percent of this conferences contents are obscure however what i can say is since the power residing in me is strong then ill use it for my comrades buchou asia akeno san and also the other members as well if theyre exposed to trouble th en ill protect them wait i am still quite weak though however what i can do is that even if i have to risk my life i will live alongside my comrades while i fired the words with all my might that sensation attacked my bodys functions stopped for a moment thats right this was the sensation when i received gaspers time stopping part 4 ara when i noticed it the interior of the staff meet ing room had changed just a little michael san was looking outside from a window while sirzechs sama and azazel were
deep in talk looking serious for some reason oh the sekiryuutei has come back azazel said this upon seeing me ddid something hap pen looking around people were divided between those that could move and those that were stopped all the bigshots were moving sirzechs sama leviathan sama grayfia san michael san and azazel as well as the vanishing dragon seemed to be able to mo ve the club members were it seems only me ise yuuto and xenovia are able to move from my family wait buchou im so glad you can move conversely asia akeno san koneko chan and kaichou were all stopped for even akeno san to have been stopped it would appear the reason youre safe is because ise is the possessor of the sekiryuutei and because yuuto has an irregular holy demonic sword that has attained balance breaker xenovia invoked durandal just before it happened just as buchou said x enovia was holding the really dangerous sword that kept giving off a holy aura she seemed to be putting it away right at that moment and the holy sword was returned to the space time warp the sense of time stopping was somehow remembered by
my body when time was on the verge of stopping i thought i could use durandals power to protect myself it seems i was correct this girl remembered the instant of time being stopped with her body as usual her bodys specs were frightening be that as it may what happened buchou it seems to be a terrorist attack interrupting buchous words as she started to answer my question azazel said this wait rather a terrorist attaaaaaaaaaaack during this important conference that would something something the future of the worlds state of affairs would you like to look outside azazel gestured at the window with his chin i approached the meeting rooms glass window and kah flashes suddenly spread out in front of my eyes owah what thi s new school building seemed to be subtly shaking were under fire in any era where a power tried to form peace with other powers there will also be a gathering of those who dislike it and try to disturb it azazel pointed outside when i turned my eyes in the direction he pointed there were human like silhouettes that had arrived in the school yard and in the air looking closely
these mage like guys dressed in black robes seemed to be firing attacks at us that were similar to magic bullets lucki ly these attacks didnt look to be doing any damage to the new school building however i also couldnt see any sign of the attack relenting are those the terrorists what was their goal rather it was obviously to interfere with this meeting right azazel who was standing next to me before i noticed gave a fearless smile those guys are so called magicians they use a kind of magic that was originally interpreted from the magic system of devils by the legendary magician merlin ambrosius and reco nstructed as sorcery from the power of the magic theyre emitting id guess that they each possess the magic power of a mid class devil so its a fact that those guys in the school yard are stronger than the weak me theres a lot in short it means that humans can use powers like those of devils though of course it also seems to be possible that they cant become devils themselves its especially troublesome when a sacred gear possessor learns magic well their attacks arent capable of damaging
this school building because the strongest protective barrier created by me sirzechs and michael is enveloping this place though thanks to that we cant leave here this governor knew a lot of things it was natural for him to be a person at the top but he was also able to explain things in plain words too tthen what about when time seemed to stop before most likely they used a sacred gear or magic that transferred power on the half vampire kids sacred gear and forcefully made it go into ba lance breaker state its only a temporary balance breaker state but even then to think that it even affects people present in the interior of objects outside the field of vision so that half vampires potential ability was this high well it seems t hat he lacks the output to stop us top position guys though no way then gasper who was in the clubroom in the old school building has been captured and is being used but they transferred power there are other sacred gears with that kind of abili ty boosted gear combines together both the nearly endless doubling ability and the transfer ability there exist
independent sacred gears with either of these respective powers the doubling sacred gear and the transfer sacred gear all the longinus are just a combination of one ability with another essentially they combine powerful abilities that arent supposed to be combined maybe the longinus are born because of a kind of bug or errors in the sacred gear program constructed by god thats one of the opinions of us in grigori if i had to say it in an easy tounderstand way to you its a fact that there are other powers that can transfer thank you very much for your rather easy tounderstand explanation or rather gasper was being used like i thought buchou came to my side gasper has been made into a terrorist weapon at the old school building just where did they get information on my servant moreover for them to use his power to go after this important meeting never before have i been so insulted like this oooh onee sama was making a red aura gush out from her entire body s scary by the way the armies of the fallen angels angels and devils outside of this school building all seem to be
stopped as well geez rias gremory s family is just dreadful azazel put a hand on buchous shoulder with a tap but buchou mercilessly brushed the hand away his hand pushed away azazel turned that hand to the window with a sigh then a countless number of spears of light appeared in t he sky outside baaaa the spears of lights rained down all at once at the same time as azazel lowered his hand and they were showered down upon the magicians the terrorists also made protective barriers but they went through without any trouble and t he magicians were eradicated uwah incredibleeeeeeeeeee in an instant the magicians countless stiff corpses scattered about the school grounds it suddenly turned into a gruesome scene or rather hes seriously strong this governor was he a one hit annihilation monster he finished it all with a single act without seeming to make any particular preparation this school is enveloped in a barrier but despite this they appeared within the barrier there must be a transfer use magic circle or a per son connecting with a gate to the inside of the premises either way if they increase the effect of forbidden balor
view any more than this theres a possibility that theyll be able to stop even people like us too by stopping us here with their fierce attack they intend to annihilate each school building the instant our time is stopped they seem to be using considerable military power preceding azazels gaze magic circles appeared at various places in the school grounds and started shining ominousl y from the magic circles appeared forms that were the same as the magician group that azazel had defeated just now or rather they were magicians just like before there were more appearing there were a lot of them still appearing its a repeat from just now theyll keep appearing even as we knock and knock them down however even if the timing and terrorist technique is good it may be that they have a knowledgeable person who has inside information is there unexpectedly a traitor here azazel s aid something shocking a traitor please dont say such a scary thing cant we escape from here azazel shook his head at my question we cant escape as long as the barrier enclosing the entire school isnt dissolved we cant go outside but if th e
barrier is dissolved damage may be inflicted in the human world we have to wait for the enemy boss to appear if we shut ourselves in here for a while theyll get tired of waiting and eventually show their face id like to know who the mastermind is quickly besides if we go out and rampage imprudently we may just do exactly as the enemy wishes hhow composed so we just need to wait until the enemy shows their true form that said we leaders cant move while making preparations however our fi rst goal is to take back gasper from the old school building which has become the terrorists base so said sirzechs sama i see so the present situation has made gasper return to being the number one dangerous person if we fell under fire while the to p maou samas were time stopped itd be serious onii sama ill go gasper is my servant its my responsibility to take him back buchou sent out a strong will in her eyes as she proposed this sirzechs sama suddenly laughed i thought i said it befor e i understand my younger sisters personality however how will you go to
the old school building its filled with magicians outside this new school building the usual transfer is also blocked by magic the old school building my bases clubroom ha s a remaining unused rook piece being safe kept within it i see castling huh since they would usually expect us to go take him back this could catch the opponent off guard theyll anticipate some kind of trick ive heard of this castling a te chnique to instantly switch the locations of the king and rook it was said to be one of the special techniques of the rating games in other words buchou could transfer over to the old school building in an instant amazing as expected of buchou if it s teleportation we didnt need to go outside an instant charge at the enemys centre the enemy would also be surprised by this maybe the mastermind that azazel mentioned would also be surprised and come out alright however its reckless to go alone grayfia is it possible to transfer more than one person through castling with my magic system yes it seems we can only deploy a simple technique ceremony here but its possible to transfer ojou sama
and one other so rias and someone else sirzechs sama ill also go i raised my hand and volunteered it was my important kouhai ill save him together with buchou sirzechs samas eyes turned towards me for a moment but then quickly moved in azazels direction azazel according to a rumour youve been researching how to freely handle sacred gears for a fixed time right yeah thats true but what about it is it possible to control the sekiryuutei azazel fell silent in response to sirzechs samas question however the govern or of the fallen angels groped in his breast pocket and oi sekiryuutei azazel called out to me iim hyoudou issei then hyoudou issei take this azazel threw something at me i caught it and looked at it they seemed to be wide rings to put around the hand multiple layers of strange characters were carved into them accessories as i thought doubtfully azazel spoke to me those are bracelets with the power to control a sacred gear to some degree if you find the aforementioned half vampire put one on him itll help him control his power somewhat but there are two of them yes there were two
bracelets one for gasper and the other the other one is for you you havent mastered the power of the welsh dragon right if so put it on if its for a short time itll be possible to go into the balance breaker state without paying any price this will be used in place of the price hey s seriously if i put this bracelet on my arm ill be able to go into balance breaker as a side effect youll also temporarily undo the seal thats been applied on you your pawn power has been blocked right where did you get that information i was a pawn that had consumed eight pieces but since i didnt yet possess the strength to cope w ith that power my power was being suppressed by buchou this is only my personal opinion but in terms of piece distribution ddraig is seven and youre one right no it may be 79 and 01 promotion also builds the necessary foundation for the sake of manifesting ddraigs true power either way its a fact that releasing ddraigs power will release the seal as well right rias gremory buchou just narrowed her eyes in response to
azazels question and gave no particular answer use that ring as a l ast resort since it cant regulate its consumption of stamina youll just exhaust yourself wastefully if you activate it suddenly it will consume an intense amount of stamina and magical power while in armour mode and that was azazels supplementary e xplanation i see since i dont know what will happen its better to transform myself when its a serious pinch azazel spoke again to reinforce his point remember this well the current you is a devil that was originally born as a human even if one possesses a powerful sacred gear theres no meaning if the host is useless if the opponent against the current you is inexperienced you can just sprinkle ddraigs power to win but its a tractable thing regarding those with greater power and those who u nderstand your ability at any rate you yourself are your sacred gears weak point the cluster of your weakness is assuredly your inability to master it youll eventually die if you cant tame your power ii understand yes i understand that all to o painfully well however saying it again gouged terribly at my heart yeah
i recognise it im not the one whos amazing its ddraig thats amazing however this fallen angel azazel spoke in an easily understandable manner and put things into a new li ght wouldnt he be suitable as a teacher or lecturer azazel just how far did you research sacred gears michael san asked azazel while sighing but the fallen angel governor just smiled fearlessly its fine isnt it god the one who made the sacre d gears isnt here right isnt it better if theres someone who can explain about sacred gears at least a little i heard there are all kinds of things that even you dont know right i think the problem is that youre the one whos researching it and so these big shots kept talking together like this but i just felt a little joy at the existence of these bracelets with this i can be useful to buchou buchou received the so called special technique formula from her forehead by grayfia san ojou sama please wait a little while please hurry grayfia while we were inside getting ready azazel and the hakuryuukou were deep in talk vali what is it azazel you go catch the
enemys attention outside if the hakuryuukou comes out a t the front itll disrupt their strategy a little also something may move so that person will also become aware of me being here if you do that they wont expect the sekiryuutei to transfer over to the centre using castling itll also have the e ffect of attracting their attention a little wouldnt it be faster to blow away all the terrorists in the old school building and the half vampire who has become a problem vali said all that naturally what the hell is he saying this bastard quit that at a time where weve united in peace in the worst case scenario well do that but if we can save a member of the maous family saving him will be of benefit for us in the future understood vali agreed to azazels suggestion while letting out a breath kah wings of light unfolded on valis back so thats his sacred gear balance break vanishing dragon balance breaker after that sound a snow white aura covered valis form when the light stopped his body was wrapped in a suit of whole body armour that emitted a white radiance so
this is his balance breaker this guy whoseems to be my rival could enter balance breaker so easily i still couldnt do this even if i entered it i still had to pay a price after glancing at me vali opened the meeting rooms window and rushed out into the sky at that instant dodododododododon a shock wave was created outside when i looked the group of magicians were trampled down by the guy in white armour he plunged into the enemy group w hile drawing a path of light in the night sky and the aspect of a great warrior was seen strong even i could immediately understand how insanely strong he was he danced in the air without worrying about the concentrated bullets of the magicians at all and a large mass of surging bullets hit the school grounds without accomplishing anything the magicians were annihilated but magic circles appeared right afterwards and a new group of magicians appeared they really are endless azazel continuing the talk from before sirzechs sama queried azazel yeah what about it what are you trying to do by collecting sacred gears youve been collecting longinus owners too right do you intend to
kill god even though god no longer exists azazel shook his head at that question its to prepare prepare thats some uneasiness inciting talk even though you reject war michael san said this in amazement i said so right i wont go to war against you people i also wont make war here however me ans of selfdefence are necessary rather should i say were not just preparing for an attack from you then the khaos brigade khaosbrigade it was a name i hadnt heard before but it seemed sirzechs sama didnt know either from his fur rowed eyebrows i only confirmed the organisations name and background recently but my vice governor shemhaza has also had his eye on this suspiciously acting group from before that its said that theyre gathering dangerous members from all three big powers some sacred gear possessing humans who have attained balance breaker also seem to be included ive also confirmed a number of longinus possessors among them their goal is michael san asked that destruction and mayhem its that simple you know they dont like this worlds peace theyre terrorists moreover theyre ill natured to the extreme then could it be that this terrorist
attack is the organisations leader is the powerful fiendish dragon besides the welsh dragon and vanishing dragon everyone besides me became speechless at azazels confession eh what is it i see so that person has moved the ouroboros dragon ophis the dragon feared by god the one who kept reigning over with the position of the str ongest since the world began sirzechs sama also wore a grim expression what what everyones faces were gloomy or rather were they awed is this ourobo something dragon really that amazing the position of the strongest the strongest guy that vali mentioned before as i was troubled by everyones reaction a voice that i wasnt used to hearing leaped into my ear yes ophis is the leader of the khaos brigade gah a magic circle emerged on the floor of the meeting room at the same time as the voic e this isa devil this was a magic circle i had never seen before or rather i wasnt very knowledgeable about other devils but i see so youve come the mastermind this time sirzechs sama clicked his tongue eh why did he do that all of a s udden grayfia transfer rias and
ise kun quickly yes grayfia san urged me and buchou to go to a corner of the meeting room and a small magic circle was created on the floor it was the exact size to fit only about two people in it ojou sama i wi sh you the fortunes of battle wwait grayfia onii sama me and buchou were enveloped by the light of transfer khaos brigade part 1 as buchou and ise kun quickly disappeared in the transfer magic circle an unbelievable development occurred befo re my kiba yuutos eyes the magic circle that appeared on the floor of the meeting room when they saw it all the leaders of the three great powers were shocked no azazel laughed and sirzechs sama made a sour expression the magic circle of levi athan eh i couldnt believe my ears as i heard sirzechs samas words at least as far as i knew this wasnt the pattern of serafall leviathan samas magic circle then what the heck my question was quickly resolved its something seen in the books of the vatican thats the magic circle of the original maou leviathan i see id heard the rumours so then it really
still existed a single woman appeared from the magic circle she was wearing a dress that was extremely low cut and had a hi gh slit on it how do you do current maou sirzechs dono the woman greeted sirzechs sama with a fearless tone the one descended from the blood of the previous leviathan cattleya leviathan what is the meaning of this sirzechs sama said this as i thought she is related to the original maou id heard talk about it when the old four maou died and they were trying to elect new maou they said they raised a desperate resistance right till the end the people descended from the old maou i heard that the post war devils whose fighting power had already been exhausted drove off all the families of the hard line old maous armies to a corner of hell with the last of their powers after that it was said the matter continued by having a new administrat ion established in the centre said administration was the current four great maou samas the woman cattleya leviathan who was descended from the original leviathan gave a defiant smile and spoke the members of the old
maou faction have nearly all dec ided to cooperate with the khaos brigade what what a thing to say coming here the old maou faction have so its a feud between the new and old maou sides that has escalated devils are all so difficult azazel just smiled like it was someone el ses problem cattleya is it okay to interpret those words literally sirzechs its exactly as i said we are also taking charge of this attack right now so its a coup dtat huh yes this was a coup a rebellion by the old maou faction against the new maou faction to declare this at such a time and place moreover they were lending a hand to the terrorist group cattleya why sirzechs weve only arrived at the exact opposite idea of this meeting today weve concluded that since go d and the original maou are gone this world should be reformed so they did this coup after learning everything about the non existence of god and the peace conference of the three great powers moreover they really had taken the opposite path coming h ere while considering all this has that ophis seen that far ahead into
the future though that doesnt seem likely cattleya just let out a breath in response to azazels question aside from being a symbol of power he just bears the position for the sake of gathering power weve asked for his help to destroy the world and rebuild it again we will be the ones to manage the new world what for such a thing to occur so the magicians rampaging outside must be those who endorse these people if azaz els story from before was true then in addition to the old maou faction and the magicians rebels from the fallen angels and angels have appeared as well do they really hate peace so much sirzechs sama smiled very sarcastically so youre a gath ering of angel fallen angel and devil rebels who want their own world and a new earth that they rule over the mediator of that is the ouroboros ophis the strongest dragon at the top feared even by god i had heard that it was stronger than the welsh dragon and vanishing dragon according to legend if its the dragon that has infinite power similar to god cattleya chan why are you doing such a thing
cattleya showed a hateful expression at serafall samas shout serafall how dare you act so sh amelessly as the one who stole the position of leviathan from me im descended from the original leviathan i was the one suited to be maou cattleya chani i dont worry serafall today ill kill you at this place and take the title of maou levi athan for myself then ophis will become the god of the new world its fine if hes just a symbol the system the laws and the doctrine will be constructed by us michael azazel and lucifer sirzechs your era is over the expressions of sirzechs sama serafall sama and michael sama all darkened at cattleyas words howeverthere was just one person who seemed pleasant and was smiling kukukukukuku only that personseemed completely strange he showed a wicked smile like that of a bad boy azazel whats so funny anger clearly enjoyed cattleyas expression and words hahaha so you no you people will reform this world all together huh thats right thats exactly right azazel this world is in decay humans are foolish the earth will be destroyed oi oi oi arent things prospering nowadays azazel held his stomach
as he laughed cattleyas eyes twitched azazel youre the same as ever even though you have so much power youre satisfied with the current world let me tell you your goal is too clichd and harsh and yet people like that are limited to those who are excessively strong geez its really a nuisance for others descendant of leviathan your words are just like those of a villain whos about to die y ou know that azazel you would ridicule us this far cattleya was enraged and a magic aura was gushing out of her entire body it was the atmosphere of an explosive situation sirzechs michael ill take care of it dont help okay azazel stood u p the governor of the fallen angels began releasing a gloomy aura similar to doing a battle enhancement cattleya do you have no intention of surrendering that was sirzechs samas final warning cattleya shook her head that is correct sirzechs you were a good maou however you werent the best maou thats why we are aiming to be the new maou i see thats too bad seeing that confirmation azazel pointed at the window with his hand don the whole area at
the window was blown off by a bla st of light what a thing azazel unfolded twelve black wings their feathers were darker than endless darkness descendant of the former maou leviathan one of the monsters of the end not a bad opponent cattleya leviathan are you dressed up for a bo ut of armageddon with me cattleya responded to azazels intense challenge with a fearless smile of her own i was just wishing for that governor of the fallen angels doh azazel and cattleya leviathan flew out of here and a battle of light and devil magic began to unfold in the distant skies above the school yard both of them had a tremendous mass of aura it was a different dimension from us i was anxious about support but now that its gone this far should i assist maou sama or should i chase a fter buchou as i was like this sirzechs sama said to me kiba yuuto kun me and michael will keep strengthening the barrier covering this school now that azazel and cattleya are running wild the damage may become big sorry about this but until grayf ia finishes her analysis of the magicians transfer
use magic circle could you deal with the magicians outside youre ordering me to subdue the magicians a direct order from maou sama the highest honour yes sir thank you im glad that youre my sisters knight please use that balance breaker for the sake of my sister and your comrades yes xenovia please come with me yeah im also rias gremorys knight kiba yuuto i think were two similar blades now lets go after i and xenovia no dded at each other we plunged into the school yard and started slicing part 2 hah my holy demonic sword cleared through each magic protection barrier and into the magicians body how many did this make ive cut down a considerable number of magicians but a new assassin would always be summoned from the magic circle right after theyre endless zubaaaaaaah a wave along with a slashing attack was fired from the holy sword durandal and gouged out the school yard left and right the attack s laughtered the magicians in large numbers xenovia please treat the school building with a bit more care was durandal really so difficult to handle kah doh dooooooooooooooh from the sky a roaring sound could
be heard and a dazzling light could be s een as well when looking above azazel and cattleya leviathan could be seen attacking and defending intensely azazel made multiple thick and heavy spears of light easily exceeding his own height appear and then threw them at cattleya she laid out sever al layers of defensive magic circles in response and blocked the light attacks the schoolyard had received great damage here and there from the after effects of those attacks and defences if maou sama and the others hadnt been protecting the new school building significant damage would probably have happened to the building it was also fortunate that the entire school site was enveloped in a strong barrier if not the surrounding residential area would have also taken damage it was chilling each time a maximum attack that azazel or cattleya avoided collided with the protective barrier i think that azazel was greater in real power but cattleya was hanging on beyond my expectations by all rights it wouldnt be strange if cattleya had household serva nt devils with her as well however i had heard that she and the old maou faction rejected the evil pieces introduced by
the current devils cattleya had neither a lieutenant queen nor a knight that protected her person then cattleya took a small bottle out from her breastand swallowed what seemed like a small black snake that was present inside at that instant don space vibrated intensely and a wave of power surged throughout the whole school yard the magic power given off by cattleyas body s welled up and gave off an ominous aura a mass that was near that of sirzechs sama and serafall sama just what on earth was that snake she just swallowed azazel fired countless spears of light at her but they easily vanished just by cattleya calmly moving her right hand sideways such power even though you can say the fallen angel governor azazels power is the first or second most powerful of those here today and then an even more astonishing event occurred before my eyes while azazel fought wit h cattleya in the air an unforeseen blow struck the governor of the fallen angels from the side life5 welsh dragon and vanishing dragon part 1 before i realised it we were in the club room it had made a lot of noise but the
transfer had succeeded however impossible theyve transferred here damn devils the interior was occupied by magicians wearing those weird robes heeeeeey as i thought this is the enemys centre bbuchou i isesenpai gaspers voice when i turned my eyes in the direction where i heard the voice the cross dressing boy gasper was there tied to a chair with rope the cut off piece of paper bag was on his head s so he wore it buchou confirmed gaspers safety and was relieved as well gasper im so glad that youre safe buchou its already too late however gasper just broke into tears then its better ifi die please buchou senpai please kill me because of these eyes i cant make friends with anyone im only a bot herand a coward gasper raggedly shed tears captured and being used by the enemy he thought he was being a bother to us buchou kindly smiled at that gasper dont say such a stupid thing i wont abandon you you know when i transferred you into my family i said it right that now that youve been reborn you will live for me and also find a way of life that can
satisfy you but buchous words didnt get through to gasper and he shook his head i just couldnt find it for me who just c auses troubleto have value in living is youre my servant and part of my family i wont abandon you so easily even though it was finally possible for you to be free thats right gasper me and buchou wont abandon you thats right my kouha i even if you cant use your sacred gear well well stop you gan right before my eyes gasper was struck by a female magician the magician seized gaspers hair and gave a sneer now that i looked all the magicians here were female witches witches a re good too you people are so stupid its foolish how you treat such a dangerous dhampir normally its just as the old maou faction says the gremory family are as dumb as they are deeply affectionate and overflowing with power the magician assessed buchou with a contemptuous look maybe you would have gotten more value if youd quickly brainwashed this dhampir and used him effectively as a tool if you had made his sacred gear run out of control while throwing this
child into the territory of the opposing fallen angels he might even have taken out one of their leaders as well why havent you done that could it be that you intend to treat a servant as a close friend tthis i tried to strike back at that offensive remark but buchou restraine d me with her hand why buchou even though she didnt understand anything about buchou she said nothing but bad things i cant forgive her no matter how much of a girl she is there are things you can say and things you cant damn it itreasure my servant buchou retaliated back calmly please get angry theres no merit in behaving calmly with a person like this hyuh bon the magician fired a small magic bullet at buchou buchous uniform was partly blown away and white skin peeked out h her breasts could be seen just a little what a cheeky mouth you have also i dont like how youre beautiful even though youre a devil daughter of gremory the magicians words were filled with jealousy the magician put a blade at gaspers neck you move and this child dies lets have some fun the magician stuck
out a hand and started releasing even more magic buchou isnt showing any sign of avoiding it damn it the moment the magic bullet is fired again ill stand in front of buchou and bec ome a shield bon the bullet grazed the lower part just a little from my neck oww but if its just this much rather that location she aimed for buchous face u unforgivable to aim for buchous face i was angry in both heart and mind but buchou came forth from behind me and spoke to gasper kindly gasper please cause me a lot of trouble ill scold you over and over again ill comfort you ill never let you go bbuchou uuh even though it isnt being said to me im incredibly moved as expected my master is the best now then gasper youve made buchou say this much how will you respond bbuchouii gasper broke into tears however it was from neither fear nor sadness even i could tell that he was crying out of happiness alright alright in that case gasper next is a present of fighting spirit from me gaspeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer i raised my voice which rang within the room gasper my
feelings ill convey them through words and deliver them all the way to your soul dont run away dont be afraid dont cry me buchou akeno san asia kiba koneko chan and xenovia as well were all your friends we will absolutely never abandon you we wont do something like leave you out i put up my left arm hi gh activate my sacred gear boosted gear boost a red gauntlet was equipped on my left arm next promotion buchou im promoting to queen buchou nodded and my power was raised furthermore there was one more thing left ascalon blade along with a new voice my new weapon ascalon extended from the shell of my sacred gear the female magicians cautiously watched me however i pointed the tip of the sword away from the enemy and at my own hand zashu i temporarily suppressed the sword s power and personally cut the palm of my right hand with the blade it hurt but blood flowed out of my right hand ise buchou looked at my action dubiously please be at peace of mind this is a present for gasper however gasper its no use if you dont get up on
your own you know after receiving encouragement by a girl next is standing up dont you have a wonderful pair of balls on youuuuuuuuuuuuuu i stuck out my left hand and extended out ascalon that had my blood on it in gaspers d irection faster than the magicians could react the blood which had been on ascalon clung to gaspers mouth drink it the blood of me who harbours the strongest dragon and show us that youre a man gasper nodded at my words with a strong look ga sper tasted my blood that had arrived at his mouth with his tongue the instant that gasper swallowed my blood the atmosphere within the room suddenly changed an indescribable chill eerily rang through my whole body when i turned my eyes to gasper who w as tied to the chairhe wasnt there gasper wasnt sitting on the chair he had disappeared only the rope that had been tying gasper to the chair was left the female magicians were also shocked that gasper had suddenly disappeared and looked around they spread their gazes over the interior of the room and chichichichichichi a weird chirping was heard countless bats were flying near the
ceiling of the room the group of red eyed bats swooped down on the female magicians all at once kuh so he transformed that damn vampire bastard the cursing women pointed their hands at the bats and tried to fire magic bullets but they were pulled down by something and greatly lost their balance countless black hands were extending out from the female m agicians shadows the hands from the shadows tried pulling the girls inside the shadows so this is the ability of a vampire take this don they fired magic bullets at the shadows but the shadow hands just dispersed uneventfully during that the b ats wrapped around the forms of the magicians and bit at various parts on their bodies you intend to suck our blood no our magic power is also being absorbed the magicians were having a hard time they were at the mercy of the bats and the hands e xtending from the shadows this wasgasper gaspers vampire power ise thats part of the power that gasper was originally hiding it must have been released from drinking your blood so said buchou i see as i thought thats gaspers power kuh in that case
we can only do this the magicians turned their aim towards this direction so they intended to aim at me and buchou doshu the countless magic bullets they fired were aimed at me and buchou butthey all stopped in mid air its useless i can see all your movements and attacks gaspers voice echoed within the interior of the room the red eyes of the bats glowed like a blaze i see so he invoked his sacred gear from the eyes of the bats moreover he was brilliantly stopping only the magic bullets so he can control his sacred gear thanks to the effect of drinking my blood im stopping you people kah countless numbers of bats made their red eyes shine and they made the time of all the female magicians in the room stop isesenpai the finishing blow leave it to me i started running and touched the magicians then while striking a cool pose in the centre of the room i cried out dress break bababah the clothes of the witches who were time stopped were brillian tly blown off a trade fair of naked woman unfolded before my eyes i could look as much as i
liked touch as much as i liked buh as a nosebleed spurted out i gave a smile of victory gasper together were invincible yes my kouhai stops the enem y and i blow off their clothes were the strongest were invincible with this the dream ive yearned for can come true pechi is that really so buchou poked my forehead while sighing part 2 by the way ddraig who is ophis i asked this while i was working to tie up the magicians and place them on the rooms magic circle ophis thats a nostalgic name so who is he that guy hes the strongest of the dragon tribe stronger than ddraig and the vanishing dragon yeah because hes stron ger than god as well hes the only existence that god couldnt take on carelessly hes a true monster with infinite power seriously so there was still a dragon stronger than you and albion hes the only one the only one who exceeds us hes the strongest existence in this world hah thats how should i put it moreover he seemed to be the boss of the terrorists buchou deployed the magic circle and sent the magicians off to a
public office in the underworld she said that they would then b e arrested and put in prison incidentally buchou had already changed into a spare uniform the reason was so we could get the terrorists as living witnesses just in case but to tie up girls with rope like this was gufufu i thought all kinds of vulg ar things senpai is your hand okay gasper who had returned from the bats and shadows to his true form asked this because he was wearing the ring i had gotten from azazel his sacred gear wouldnt run out of control yeah im used to injuries of this extent even though i look like this ive also had a hole in my stomach from the attack of a fallen angel ueeeeeeeh r really s senpai has really experienced a lot of violence iis that so thinking about it ever since i became a devil i seem to be living considerably violent days i havent worried about it since ive been living happily with buchou and the others but were the chances of me going to the jaws of death surprisingly high uu its my imagination my imagination ill try not to
think about it too deeply how was drinking my blood yes my power temporarily welled up from the bottom buti have returned to normal now i see so it includes a time limit even so he becomes plenty powerful when drinking my blood yes all of them have been transferred over there now then ise gasper lets return to maou sama that was buchou thank you for your hard work yes me and gasper responded and followed behind buchou we left the room and moved to the entrance of the old school building meanwhile gasper was still sticking to my back there seemed to be a lot of children who hide behind my back somehow theres asia and this one too in any case i also have to fix this guys hikikomori disposition just as we were exiting the entrance while i thought that doggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan something fell down right in front of us after the cloud of dust which enveloped it vanished there was tch so youre betraying me under these circumstances vali it was the gov ernor of the fallen angels who was gravely injured thats right azazel while giving off a dazzling radiance the hakuryuukou stood before us
there was a lady who i didnt know at his side as well the instant you decided on peace arrangements were made to invoke the kidnapped dhampirs sacred gear and begin the terrorist attack the hakuryuukou ran wild along with me once we saw a good time itd be good if we could bury any of the leaders of the three great powers itd be fine if the meeting fell apart because of that ooh what sexy clothes clothes that expose the breasts so much s such a risqu thing that also has a deep slit its the best she has such nice legs oi i feel vulgar eyes is this kid the sekiryuutei vali yeah while regr ettable its true he truly is a most regrettable host dont keep saying regrettable regrettable even im living through every day doing my best or rather why are you and azazel confronting each other or rather who is this onee chan the onee san looked at the babbling me with pitying eyes i see he really does seem to be a regrettable child vali will you kill him my feelings are wavering on what to do to be honest i wasnt expecting
for him to be here heh i didnt understand thing s at all whats happening geez ive also lost my edge for one of my followers to do this azazel laughed at himself eh then the hakuryuukou is seriously the terrorists comrade that nee san there is also an enemy vali stored away the mask on h is helmet with a clang and showed his face when when did you decide to do this i got the offer while i was en route returning kokabiel to headquarters sorry azazel this side seems to be interesting vali has the vanishing dragon capitulated to ophis no im just cooperating stubbornly they gave an attractive offer wouldnt you like to fight against the asgard when they said that as someone who wants to test my power i couldnt decline azazel you dislike the idea of fighting with val halla the asgard right you dislike war i told you to become strong but i should have also said dont destroy the world while doing so thats unrelated i just want to fight eternally i see no i may have anticipated somehow in my heart that you would leave my side ever since the time
we met till now you wanted to fight with strong people the preparations and information outlet for this were thanks to the hakuryuukou its unusual of you to have left him alone even though you unders tood his true nature as a result youve wrung your own neck the lady sneered at azazel ignoring azazel who gave a bitter smile vali hit his hand against his chest and spoke to me my real name is vali vali lucifer wwhat lucifer im a descendent of the previous generations maou lucifer who died however im a child of mixed blood born from a father who was the old maous grandson and a human mother i obtained the vanishing dragons sacred gear because im half human it was just by c hance however i who is a true blood relative of lucifer and is also the vanishing dragon was born if there really is such a thing as fate and miracles i may be that just joking as he said that several devil wings grew from his back along with hi s wings of light ddevil the hakuryuukou is whats more he said lucifer wasnt that the old maou no way that cant
be buchou also wore an astonished expression on her face however azazel confirmed it its true if there is such a r idiculous existence its him hell become the strongest hakuryuukou among those i knew in the past and present and probably of all time as well eeven if you say that s so hes really the strongest somehow i cant catch up with various arrangements happening that i dont know about lately or rather there are a lot of halves around me like akeno san gasper and this guy have you resolved yourself azazel the lady still sneered at azazel who was this person even i could grasp that h er killing intent was tremendous tch that volume of aura that swelled up earlier what did you get from that bastard ophis the lady smiled at azazels question yes he who is the dragon that possesses infinite power for the sake of the worlds r eformation i borrowed a little of his power thanks to that i can fight against you theres even a chance that i can beat sirzechs and michael theyre such foolish governors and so are you so i am i may be foolish i cant
do anything without s hemhaza im just a sacred gear enthusiast but you know do you really think that sirzechs and michael are idiots at least theyre far superior compared to someone mediocre like you the ladys face twisted at azazels words what nonsense very well ill deal the finishing blow right here and now i will destroy you the governor of the fallen angels as the first step towards the creation of a new world the lady spoke in a strong tone however azazel just seemed pleased he took out something whi ch looked like a dagger from his pocket thats azazel pointed the tip of the dagger at the lady who was looking at it suspiciously i have gone beyond being a sacred gear enthusiast i also produce them myself ive built replicas well almost all of them are garbage though god the one who developed the sacred gears was amazing thats the only thing i respect him for however theyre incomplete its because god and the maou died while leaving behind bugs which can upset the worlds balan ce like the longinus and balance breaker well thats why sacred gears are interesting though be at a peace
of mind things like sacred gears absolutely wont be made in the new world even without such things the world functions eventually well ma ke northern europes odin move as well and then the world will have to change after deliberately raising gossip with a complacent smile azazel spat out the more i hear the more i feel like vomiting at your goals valhalla the earth gods so you i ntend to snatch everything through odin from the side rather than that the person who steals my pleasure can go and disappear the dagger that azazel had changed shape its parts separated and light gushed out iimpossible azazel you in front o f the latter who had grasped something the governor of the fallen angels uttered words with power balance break the vicinity was wrapped in a momentary flash after the light faded there was a person there wearing gold plate armour it had a golden sparkling radiance and a form resembling that of a dragon bah twelve jet black wings unfolded from its back black feathers fluttered about the surroundings the dragon imitating gold armour made its black wings flap i thought it was a little cool aza zel
was equipped with dragon armour a huge spear of light was in his hands i studied the vanishing dragon and other dragon series sacred gears and produced this my masterpiece artificial sacred gear this is fallen dragons flash speardown fall dragon spear in its pseudo balance breaker state fallen dragons armourdown fall dragon another armou i could feel a dragons surge from beyond the armour it wasnt ordinary a top class powerful aura to the point of overwhelming was being emitted from his entire body that was above what i had felt up until now it easily beat kokabiels uoooh its like a bargain sale of balance breakers wasnt that a r are phenomenon no that isnt a true balance breaker what do you mean ddraig he made the sacred gear go into a burst state and did a forced awakening a kind of running out of control the sacred gear will break after a battle with that does he in tend to use that so called artificial sacred gear as a disposable so its a disposable artificial sacred gear even so what i didnt understand was how it could be emitting a dragon aura however azazels development of sacred
gears was unexpected inc identally unless the owner of a real incarnation type sacred gear died it could regenerate no matter how many times it broke conversely if you stole a sacred gear through a special method they seem to die the jewel in my left arms gauntlet and the m ultiple jewels that existed in my balance breaker armour didnt have just a single function and could be regenerated even if destroyed if he was an opposing existence then the hakuryuukou should be the same hahaha as expected of azazel you really are incredible vali laughed he laughed in the face of someone so strong is he fearless no hes crazy azazel turned to face vali vali id also like to be your opponent but well please get along with the welsh dragon dont joke around i dont want to get along with someone like him however fighting with azazel seems fun vali also said that then please do that i have no interest in something like a rival showdown its based on a dragon endowed with power right yeah i just seale d the gigantis dragon fafnir in this artificial sacred gear i copied it from the sacred
gears of the two heavenly dragons the welsh dragon and the vanishing dragon ive yet to see if it succeeded or not he copied boosted gear rather he mentioned the name of a dragon i dont know hes one of five great dragon kings azazel talked about vritra the other day right in addition theres the chaos karma dragon tiamat the mischievous dragon yulong and the sleeping dragon midgardsormr though i say that vritra was eliminated long ago and sealed somewhere if what azazel says is true then fafnir was also sealed though originally there were six dragon kings ah somehow ive become confused i wont understand it even if you tell me something like that all of a sudden ive heard about tiamat somewhere before the others i dont know at all unexpectedly you might meet them soon since tiamat hates me uwah i just heard such an inconvenient talk geez ive had enough of meeting these some thing or other dragons ah so thats why michael gave me a dragon slaying sword azazel even though you possess that much power you cattleya you yourself said that you made a pact with the ouroboros dragon the research of sacred
gears shouldn t have advanced to such an extent from that look it seems that the group that betrayed my organisation stole some of the sacred gear research however its pointless only i and shemhaza know a portion close to the truth a bluish black aura cover ed the ladys body as she clicked her tongue i am one who is descended from the great true leviathan cattleya leviathan i wont lose to an annoying fallen angel like you the lady shouted or rather this person is leviathan sama w well shes certai nly closer to the leviathan sama that i imagined azazel beckoned to the lady who introduced herself as cattleya come dont look down on me the lady clad herself in an extra large aura and flew out at an extreme speed zan it was an instantaneous event the lady called cattleya dived at azazel and azazel also responded with the spear he held in an instant bushu fresh blood gushed out from the ladys body she feebly fell down to her knees on the spot when i looked the ground was split even f ar behind the lady the ground had been gouged out from the aftershock
of azazels attack incredible what power the attack and defence had happened in the world of comma and had come to an end it isnt over cattleya changed her arm into a tentacle like thing and wrapped it around azazels left arm a suspicious pattern emerged on the ladys body that is a self destruct use technique formula buchou said that seriously thats for self destruction so thats this ladys dying will azazel tried to tear the tentacle away but there was no sign of it coming off at all azazel even if you try to kill me while in this state its useless now that youre connected with me this strong magic will also activate and kill you too when i die so y oull deal great damage to me with self sacrifice resolution its a tawdry way of thinking but the result is an enormous reason ise gasper get some distance as things stand well get caught up in the blast but buchou what about azazel if hes the governor of his organisation hell deal with it somehow however well get caught up in it and die thats serious it would be lovely to die together with buchou
but i dont want to die in such a place and moreover while wrapped up in someone elses battle we quickly got some distance even as we got away by a certain extent buchou deployed several layers of defensive barriers and started preparing for the explosions aftershocks wah gaspers scream when i looked some kind of magical pattern was engraved on gaspers eyes sorry but ill be sealing that itd be annoying if time is stopped its vali but you know if youre aware of its ability and activation conditions that sacred gear really isnt that great a wonder its full of weak points there are many techniques like those that seal ones vision also if his magic is drained it changes into a double edged sword that submits damage to allies as well that guy was flying in the air thats the best or rather it was jus t as he said gasper in his current state was full of weak points just like me a powerful sacred gear equals strength that was just an illusion inside of me azazel it was just as you said even if a sacred gear was strong its all useless if the ho
st was useless or rather i still couldnt fly in the air damn it im not able to say anything about gasper either i have insufficient training we watched azazels situation from the place we escaped to azazel still couldnt remove the tentacle it s eemed to retain no damage even when he tried to cut it with the spear that tentacle was made in a special way by absorbing my life it wont break the lady laughed fearlessly giving up on cutting it azazel shrugged his shoulders the next instant bashu the tentacle was cut off along with his left arm uwah seriously he cut his own arm off fresh blood gushed out from the wound of azazels left arm the cut off piece of his arm turned into dust you cut off your own arm cattleya was shocked her abdomen was then pierced by a spear of light that azazel threw ill give you an arm at least shuwa cattleyas body blew up then turned into dust and vanished into the sky because she received large damage from a light attack she was annihilat ed since light was a deadly poison to devils and this seemed to be
no exception kah azazels armour was released the governor of the fallen angels didnt seem to regret the arm hed lost he just clicked his tongue tch so this is the limit of an art ificial sacred gear theres still much room for improvement as long as the core jewel is safe i can remake it again ill have you keep me company for a little while longer gigantis dragon kun fafnir and he lightly kissed a jewel like object in his hand that was the conclusion of the battle between that lady who called herself leviathan and azazel all that was left wasthe white armoured vali who descended from the night sky as expected of azazel however your armour has been released so your artificial sacred gears still require more study azazel pointed at vali now then vali what will you do shall i go at it again even if i have no armour and am one handed i can fight with you adequately azazel made a spear of light appear in his hand and pointed the blade at the hakuryuukou youll still fight even with that injury what fighting spirit vali glanced at azazel who took a fighting
stance and then asked us a question but dont you think that destiny is cruel whats t hat all of a sudden what is he talking about on one hand there is the strongest existence that one can think of with a maou plus a legendary dragon like me and on the other hand there is a mere human like you who possesses a legendary dragon as well say what you like but i think that this accident of fate is cruel though were rivals bearing the same dragon type sacred gears the gap between us two owners is too great yyou mean me i pointed at myself vali nodded amusedly i investigated you a little your father is an ordinary office worker you mother sometimes goes out to a parttime job as an ordinary full time housewife the blood relatives of both your parents are completely ordinary there are also no ability users or practitioners who possessed power among your ancestors of course your ancestors had nothing to do with devils or angels either you really are ordinary your friends arent special either you were a completely ordinary male high school student until you were reborn a s a
devil as well with the exception of boosted gear youre nothing that guy laughed with a pitying expression boring when i learned about you who was so excessively boring i laughed out of disappointment ah so this is my rival i give up if your parents had at least been magicians than maybe the story would change a bit thats right how about this kind of setting you can become an avenger i had no idea what he ws talking about how to say it i felt like this guy was smart in a d ifferent way i couldnt understand him at all i could understand that he was different from akeno san and gasper that he didnt hate his upbringing no doubt he was proud of his lineage if there were those who suffer from their birth there are also t hose who take delight in it the world was so complicated that it couldnt be processed by my brain but even i understood his next words quite clearly ill kill your parents if i do that your personal history will become a little more interesting if your parents are killed by a valuable existence like me dont you
think youll be able to openly devote yourself to a solemn destiny yeah ill do that after all your parents will from now on as well live ordinarily grow old ordinarily and die ord inarily the setting i spoke of is much more brilliant than such a boring life right i couldnt express it i couldnt express this feeling that was born in my heart a feeling of a degree i had never felt before was starting to be born within me i could only say this im going to kill you you bastard i quietly let that out of my mouth at that moment my head finally understood ah so this is what they call killing intent just as you said my father is an ordinary office worker who wor ks from morning to evening for our family my mother is an ordinary housewife who makes delicious food for our family morning noon and evening however they raised me up to this point to me theyre the best parents why should my parents have to be ki lled by this kind of bastard thats also a stupid reason my father and mother had nothing to do with you kill
them my father and mother why should they have to be mixed up in the situation of someone like you and be killed as if i know anything a bout things like valuable or destiny he is the one person i cant forgive vali lucifer as if ill let you do it he is the one person i absolutely can not forgive ill be damned if i let my parents be killed by the likes of yooooooooooooou welsh dragon over booster as if responding to my anger my sacred gear started to release a strong bright red aura with the ring i got from azazel also acting on it i equipped booster gear scale mail without having to sacrifice anything however a countd ownlike thing appeared on the jewel of my left arms gauntlet time wise i didnt have even fifteen minutes though it was still better than the mere ten seconds of my incomplete balance breaker look albion hyoudou isseis power went up by an incompa rable amount the plain and simple reason called rage was the trigger but this is hahahaha what a dragons surge sacred gears simply use strong emotions as food for power hyoudou isseis rage
is at its genuine limit and its turned towards you o nly straightforward people can draw out the dragons power i see so his greater affinity with his dragon is also explained through this reason as if i know in any case if i dont do something about this guy my surroundings will become a disaster i wont allow that however you still arent clever hyoudou issei your intelligence is insufficient to control ddraig that is a sin stop chattering and talking about things i dont understaaaaaaand yes that is exactly why youre called an idiot spouting an aura from the magic power jets on my back i rushed towards vali vali covered his face with his mask so hes prepared to fight it was only my second time using balance breaker but unlike that time with riser a failed attack was unaccept able however vali easily avoided and dodged my tackle not yet i regained my balance in mid air and dove again at vali who had just dodged i extended ascalon from my gauntlet and unleashed an attack with my unskilled weapon however i couldnt manage to land a single hit with only my mere swinging slashes on
vali as he dodged with light movements vali that sword carries dragon slaying powers if it hits just once youll undeniably receive great damage is that so albion but that doesnt mean an ything if it doesnt hit just as he says i wont be able to even graze him with my skill damn it if its like this i should have learned more swordplay from kiba next time ill train seriously in this balance breaker state its temporarily possibl e to use my doubling ability whenever and however i want however every time you use it your stamina or magical power will be consumed the doubling ability will proportionally take away stamina to how high it is thats my original balancer breaker ability although this is a temporary balance breaker state wouldnt you just be committing an act of folly by exhausting the power that maintains your armour with just one use even the bracelet you got from azazel has its limits every time you use it the time for using balance breaker will decrease so even just maintaining this state uses up stamina valis side must have a lot of surplus your opponent vali seems to have a
tremendous amount of magic power as a paired existence the hakuryuukou wil l also shave off power every time he uses his ability but if the hosts stamina is great then the time in which he can use it will also be enormous tch what an unpleasant reality the difference in power between me and vali was decisive as i thoug ht i was a lot weaker thats obvious he had a complete balance breaker i on the other hand got a lot of help and have a balance breaker that was severely limited no before that me and that guy our basic specs were too different don guhah at that instant i choked a heavy blow hit me in the chest heavy rather it was too fast for me to see what a shot my legs trembled from just this t there was also a crack in my armour if i received many of these kinds of hits itd abruptly be over so this is my rival hahahaha how embarrassing weak too weak vali harshly made fun of me however i really did feel that way ise buchou seemed worried as she watched me i dont want to look
uncool in front of the woman i fell in love with i wa s born from parents from ordinary families was reborn as a devil and by chance obtained the power of a dragon he was born with the lineage of the old maou and got the power of a legendary dragon there was no talent in me and in him there was an overf lowing amount of talent the strongest host that could control the power of his sacred gear the ideal existence that was certainly vali divide i heard a voice from the hakuryuukous gauntlet and my power instantly vanished did he halve my power w as it activated from the blow i received to my chest before boost however i also activated my own sacred gear and my power was restored partner the power that was halved was restored by my power but the vanishing dragons other ability is trouble some ddraig what do you mean that guy halves his opponents power and then adds the decreased portion of power to himself in other words your power is taken away and turned into his own power stamina cant be recovered its only power to the end tthen
even if i reset from the minus that guy will become plus thats right however no matter how amazing the host is he has a limit power that goes beyond his capacity is released from the wings of light on his back in order to keep maintainin g his power limit without destroying his body so then he always keeps his power at its peak without bursting and destroying himself come on come on seeming to enjoy himself vali fired a seemingly endless number of magic bullets i couldnt run a way as i wished either the rounds after rounds of bullets he lightly fired left heavy damage i could easily imagine that i had become completely covered in bruises kuh id like to shower him with my own blows somehow if not i wouldnt be able to re strain this dark thing that had been born in my heart as vali continued attacking he resumed his irritating tone your attacks are also dull you just plunge in its meaningless in that case what a waste of a treasure your use of your power is als o unskillful ah is that so im unskilled am i if its that i
know at this rate the rival showdown between the hakuryuukou and the sekiryuutei will be gooooooooooooooooon before he could finish talking i made magic power suddenly spout from th e jets on my back and plunged into the barrage of bullets the magic bullets struck various places on my body it hurts but so what just one shot just one shot is fine i strongly clutched my left hand power on just this single point here is enough besides i dont need any power to turn ill also throw away all defences now the magic bullets were shot at my armour and my armour was destroyed little by little my face area was also hit and the mask part was also shattered so youre charging to go as far as repeating the same tactic you really know nothing of combat something like that vali deployed what seemed to be a shield of light in front of him and tried to defend but ddraaaaaig transfer power to the stored ascalon understood transfer dokun a surge of massive power flowed into my left arm after all i dont have any sword knowledge in that case i can only lodge the power into
my fist while the sword is still stored in my gauntlet if its just hitting even i can do it gon my fist destroyed his shield of light with no trouble and i made his face eat a sharp blow whether it was because he received an unexpected blow or not that guys posture was violently bent baki cracks spread from the edges of the mask on the hakuryuukous helmet and part of valis face peeked through the crumbling portion this is it i grasped my hand around the base of the hakuryuukous wings of light that were said to gush out excess power apparently the effect of your sacred gear c omes from here in that case transfer i transferred my power to the vanishing dragons scale mail before it was in excess at that instant i was struck by the feeling that power had suddenly been removed from my body so it consumed a fair amount of stamina and magic power however in this case thats fine ill raise the power you absorb and the power you emit all at once to the extent that you cant deal with it kuh biiiiiiin all of the vanishing dragon scale
mails jewels started to nons ensically glow white red blue and yellow over and over again as it did so the absurd amount of dragon power that i had felt coming from his body vanished id forced him to activate the special ability of his sacred gear his ability stole the oppo nents power and used it as his own fuel however since the limit of the power he added was already decided it depended entirely on the hosts capacity power that went beyond the limit was gushed out from his wings of light and disposed of then what would happen if you accelerated his stealing power and gushing out power at the same time he stole so much power that he couldnt process it and at the same time he spat out power by the time it was excess as a result the vanishing dragon scale mail s topped its functions what a thing vali regain your posture at once vali reacted to albions voice and tried to defend by crossing his arms but bagan i closed my left fist that was filled with ascalons power easily destroying valis defenc es including the gauntlets of both his arms and
thrust a blow to this abdomen the white shining vanishing dragon scale mail was not enough and shattered is this the dragon slaying power it was as if the opponents armour was made out of paper goboh fresh blood flew out from valis mouth he stepped back unsteadily while holding his abdomen as blood poured down from the edge of his mouth vali smiled as if in joy hahaha amazing my sacred gear was blown off so you can do it if you try just what i would expect from my rival gan my merciless straight entered into that guys face i made it reach and hit you youre the only one i wont be satisfied with if my fist cant hit you alright for now ive paid him back for that stupid thing about my parents however ddraig clicked his tongue because while i was doing this valis armour once again returned to its previous state no way the broken part was fixed impossible so i could never beat him no matter how many times i broke it the battle doesnt end until one host is incapable of fighting its no use at this rate youll make no progress
its next to impossible for you to defeat him within the limited time of the control unit the best plan would be to run away but you cant do that can you of course theres no way i could leave buchou behind or rather where could i escape to within this barrier then what will you do the difference in power is still wide you could do something thanks to the control unit but with the limited time its out of the question will you surrender what do i do at that time something within my field of vision reflected in the background at that instant an idea appeared in my mind shall i test it no this thing is a test anyhow my time will run out and ill lose at this rate i have to do something before that hey ddraig the sacred gear responds to feelings and evolves right yeah thats right butwhy do you ask i picked up the thing lying at my feet a jewel of the vanishing dragon earlier when i hit him his armour was damaged and this thing flew out his bodys armour seems to have restored the destroyed section including the
jewel though as far as vali was concerned this jewel would turn to trash as time passed so its inconsequential however there should be at least a little of the hakuryuukous power lodged in it im transmitting my image to you lets try it i transmitted the thing i imagined in my brain to ddraig who was inside me i imagin ed hard if this image was possible i partner youve sent me quite a dangerous image however its interesting we may die but do you have the resolve i cant die i havent taken buchous virginity yet if it hurts ill endure it as long as i can just exceed this damn bastard in front of me with that fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha nice resolve in that case ill also resolve myself this isnt a notification of my character but i am the red dragon emperor that was called a mass of po wer lets show them that well live and exceed them together partner no hyoudou issei yeah what do you intend to do vali asked that seeming interested vanishing dragon albion vali ill be taking your power i smashed the sekiryuutei jewel that was on the back of my right
hand into pieces and drove into it the vanishing dragon jewel that i had picked up before your power of vanishing ill transplant it into my sacred gear while fighting i had remembered a scene within my mind it was the battle with kokabiel the other day in that battle kiba had achieved the so called impossible fusion of holy and demonic a silver aura sprang forth from my right hand and wrapped around the right side of my body a phenomenon from the jewel dokun something throbbed inside me just as a difficult todescribe pain circulated throughout my body from my jewel implanted right hand in an instant guh ah ugaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it hurts it hurts it hurts damn it what is this nugaaaaaaaaaaaah ah ah ah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah my thoughts soared in overwhelming pain owowowowowowow compared to this the damage from the spear of light before was guh ah gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah you intend to take in my power realising what i was trying to do vali showed a shocked expression what a reckless thing to do ddraig we are existences that oppose each other that is nothing more than an act of selfdestruction do you intend to annihilate yourself by doing
such a thing albion spoke indifferently guooooooooooooooooh ddraig was also leaking out agony so the dragon emperor lodged in my sacred gear also experienced pain however while ddrai g let out a scream it contained laughter as well albion youre as inflexible as always over countless eons weve lodged in hosts and continued to fight each other its a repeat of the same thing each and every time thats right ddraig that is o ur destiny even if our respective hosts are different the way we fight is the same you raise power i steal power the side that skilfully uses its sacred gear deals the finishing blow and it ends this is how it always has been and always will be ddraig let out a fearless laugh at albions words ever since meeting with this host with hyoudou issei i have learned one thing that anything is possible with determined stupidity stupidity is fine if i cant win with ability anyway ill excel t hrough stupidity respond to my feeliiiiiiiiiiings vanishing dragon power is taken my right hand was wrapped in a dazzling white light a pure white aura surrounded my right arm thena white gauntlet appeared on my
right arm hehehe so this is white dragon emperors gauntledividing gear though having only white up till my right arms elbow on my red armour looked awkward impossible such a thing is impossible albion let out an astoni shed voice no its only a little but its possible my friend fused together holy and demonic and produced things like holy demonic swords it seems it was possible to achieve it because balance has collapsed from the nonexistence of god well if i borrow the words of the leader guys it is a state where there are things like system errors or program bugs i just utilised it a little so you mean to tell me you nudged the imperfections of the sacred gear system and achieved this no but such a thing is even if you think of that to actually do it is just foolish no one knows what will happen with the fusion of opposing powers when that is something concerning dragons you might die you know no it would be natural for you to die albion still couldnt seem to believe it well to be honest though i was also desperate yeah it was reckless however i
survived ddraig sighed at my words however it certainly made your lifespan shorten its a lot even for devils who live almost endl essly i have no intention to live for ten thousand years but since there are a lot of things i want to do id like to live for at least a thousand years pachipachipachi vali clapped his hands at me whats your intention interesting then ill also get a bit serious if i win ill halve all of you and everything that surrounds you with the hakuryuukous power vali floated into the air and opened his arms wide his wings of light also grew huge halve its different with my power but what d o you mean by halving my surroundings that guy let out a laugh to my question ignorance is scary it might not be bad for you to die without knowing somehow i felt offended that guy harshly made me sound like an utter idiot half dimension surro unded by a dazzling aura along with a voice from his jewel vali pointed his hand at the trees spread out below him guban the thickness of the trees was halved in an instant ooh they
were seriously halved gubababababan more of the surrounding trees were compressed and halved dont ruin the scenery of the old school building sekiryuutei hyoudou issei let me clearly explain it to you azazel spoke ooh governor please do so in a way even the stupid me can understand that ability halves everyth ing in his surroundings in other words if the hakuryuukou became serious then rias gremorys bust will also be halved yes my thoughts soared more than they ever had before and my mind was full of only question marks i couldnt unders tand this talk that destroyed my world view from its entire base i completely could not understand it however an extraordinary fury arising from the bottom of my heart suddenly ruled my entire body breasts will be halved buchous breasts will be hal ved i moved my head mechanically and turned my gaze towards buchou after buchou saw my expression she shuddered just a little in fear yeah buchous breasts those fantastic breasts the breasts i love my everything my world my theyll be halved buchous breasts dont yeah ive decided dont fuck with meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ill kill vali ill absolutely kill vali you bastard buchoooooous so
you intend to halve the size of my buchous breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeasts boost boost boost boost boost boost voices from jewels on various places of my armour repeatedly resounded i wont forgive you youre the one person i absolutely wont forgive ill knock yo u down ill destroy you valiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boos t boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost my surroundings flew off the ground i was standing on was also greatly gouged out and changed into a crater the windows of the old school building completely cracke d and the outer wall was collapsing my whole body was wrapped in the greatest mass of aura it had ever had ahahaha what the heck is that seriously his dragon power sprang up because his masters breasts might become smaller azazel guffawed and bu rst out laughing it isnt a laughing matter this really isnt a laughing matter for me its more serious than heaven and earth being inverted yeah scramble this is the greatest possible crisis thats why its
unforgivable halve my buchous breasts thats unforgivable those breasts are mine as if id let them become small i still havent rubbed them enough i still havent sucked them yet i still havent held them between my fingers yet dont take away my dreams you bastaaaaaaaard i real ised it once again he and i can never understand each other i felt my dream to double buchous breasts yet he said that this guy will halve buchous breasts i thrust my finger at vali the far off trees in the background were blown away from the force of the aftershock of thrusting that finger just try to make a move on rias gremory ill thoroughly destroy you to the point where you wont be able to reincarnate agaaaaaaain you halving maniaaaaaaaaaaaac the clouds in the night sky were broken apar t from my exclamation the full moon which had been hidden appeared today is full of surprises who would have thought that this much power would explode because of a womans breasts however its interesting the hakuryuukou flew out at me i didnt f eel slow bah i got away from that spot and kicked vali in the side as
he flew fast have you exceeded me in speed like i know be as surprised as you please as if ill forgive as if ill forgive this guy if i leave him alone not only buchou but also akeno sans breasts will be halved kuh just imagining it makes me shudder its an unforgivable act even for god to halve those fantastic breasts i caught up with vali who was moving at the speed of light with no trouble this is for buchous breasts a hit to valis abdomen with my right fist in my mind buchous breasts shook divide at the same time i activated the hakuryuukou power i had just transplanted and felt the aura covering vali decrease sharply guha vali spat ou t bile from his mouth i continued attacking like that without interference this is for akeno sans breasts a hit to the face alright i completely broke his helmet in my mind akeno sans breasts bounced this is for asias still growing breasts the jets on his back from which his wings of light originated were destroyed in my mind asias breasts grew this is for xenovias breasts i vigorously kicked him high into the
air in my mind xenovias breasts were pleased finally this is for kon ekochans breasts that would disappear if they were halveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed i tackled him with extreme speed in my mind koneko chans breasts cried gahah vali vomited blood from my extreme tackle yeah serves you right dagan vali struck the ground my anger hadnt calmed down so i approached him and declared koneko chan she worries about her small breasts you know youll halve it i wont allow it dont take away anymore breasts from that child can you understand that pain you da mn halving maniac damn it my anger still isnt calming down should i hit him one more time in contrast to me who had gotten angry vali just gave a seemingly happy smile its sickening interesting truly interesting vali i finished analysi ng his halving power when compared with the control method of your power you can handle it i see im not afraid of him with this no way its not showing any effect anymore even though i thought i delivered that much pain albion do you think he s worthy enough to show the hakuryuukous supremacy dragonjuggernaut drive if its the current hyoudou
issei vali its not a good choice in this place if you recklessly enter juggernaut drive ddraigs curse might be removed itll all work out albion i who am about to awaken am the heavenly dragon what that damn vali was chanting something dont act rashly vali is it your desire to be at the mercy of my power albion was angry i dont know whats going on but ill take him down before he prepares his new attack when i tried to deliver a hit as a finishing blow to vali with the moon floating within the night sky in the background a single silhouette swooped down to our loca tion it swiftly came into the space between vali and me it was a man wearing armour that would be worn by a military commander of the romance of the three kingdoms17 vali ive come for you it was a young man with a refreshing looking face he spoke to vali cheerfully so its bikou what have you come for vali stood up while wiping away the blood from his mouth isnt that cruel i made a long journey and came all the way to this island country because
my partner is in a pinch you know the other guys were making a fuss at headquarters you know because were joining together to fight the northern country gods you were supposed to fle e and return right away if the mission failed right cattleya failed to assassinate michael azazel and lucifer right in that case your observation role is also over come back with me i see so its already time what are they talking about as they please who are you i pointed at the person who had just appeared and asked that hes the descendent of the victorious fighting buddha18 the one who answered was azazel huh that isnt familiar at all though let me say it with a name that you can grasp hes sun wukong the famous damn monkey in the journey to the west19 eh eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh sssun wukoooooooong i was so shocked that all my anger till now was blown away because hes the one from that famous story to say it correctly he is a monkey youkai that has inherited sun wukongs power however it really is the end of the world if even you have joined the khaos brigade no youre the
sun wukong to the vanishing dragon youre also well matched that guy laughed at azazels words with a cack le im different from the first generation that became a buddha i just live doing as i like my name is bikou nice to meet you sekiryuutei he casually greeted me the youkai called bikou spun around a cane that had appeared in his hand and then pie rced it into the ground instantly a black darkness spread over the ground it enveloped vali and bikou and made them completely sink into it so they intend to escape dont kid around i still have to give him my breast doctrine one more time wait a s if ill let you escape i tried to catch him but kah my sacred gear was released my armour vanished and the ring which helped unleash my power also crumbled away the balance breaker state that was reinforced by the ring had been removed azazel dont you have more of those rings i cant let him escape it takes a tremendous amount of time to purify those things i cant mass produce them and even if i could the possibility of attaining complete balance breaker
fades if used too muc h to the end its an emergency use measure right now is for emergency use i was made a fool of by him as if ill let him get away suddenly i was seized by intense fatigue i couldnt put any strength into my feet i couldnt grasp my fist ei ther if you explosively emit that much power in an instant your stamina will become empty as you are now what you are able to store is limited and long battles are impossible that was azazels explanation but wasnt vali armoured for the whole ti me i see as expected thats the decisive gap between me and vali theres no meaning if i cant maintain that period of time where i temporarily surpass him for a long time i as the hakuryuukou was occupied by the blood relative of the old maou the enemy isnt just angels fallen angels and devils eventually well fight again but at that time it will be even more intense well each get stronger stopping mid sentence just there the hakuryuukou vanished into the darkness along with sun wuko ng the festival ends when we set foot on the
school grounds the armies of the three big powers had come in and carried out the processing after the battle they carried away the corpses of the dead magicians and appeared to be cleaning up a fter the battle when we advanced to the centre of the school grounds the forms of sirzechs sama serafall leviathan sama and michael san could be seen giving orders to people who seemed to be subordinates when sirzechs sama caught sight of us he raised his hands so you were safe thank goodness azazel what happened to that arm seeing the one armed azazel sirzechs sama gestured his hand at asia asia responded to that and applied her recovery sacred gear on the opening of azazels wound pale gre en light healed the wound on azazels arm but the lost arm wasnt fixed i was caught by cattleya and nearly self destructed along with her i had no choice but to cut it off i see her matter was a problem on the devils side about that wound sirzechs sama tried to say words to make up for it in another form but azazel held him back with his hand and showed that it
wasnt necessary i alsocaused trouble with vali so he betrayed you from the start he was a guy that pursued only power if you look at it from the results its possible to understand and say ah i see however its my responsibility that i didnt stop it from happening azazels eyes seemed lonely somehow did he feel something for the time he was with vali mi chael san came between sirzechs sama and azazel now then im returning to heaven at once and will work on a plan for the matter of peace and countermeasures against the khaos brigade im sorry i had arranged things this time we who set up the place of this conference feel ashamed sirzechs please dont feel so responsible as for me im just glad that the three great powers are walking on the path to peace together you know with this useless quarrels should also decrease well subordinates who dont agree with that will also leave azazel made that sarcastic remark that is inevitable since weve been hating each other for a long time however it should change even a little from now on the problem is the khaos brigade that we cant
assu me is good then lets cooperate and discuss from now on regarding that matter azazel and michael san nodded at sirzechs samas idea then ill return to heaven at once ill come back immediately so well conclude the formal peace agreement at that time and then i spoke out to michael san who would try to be here later though it was rude uumm michael san what is it sekiryuutei boy theres just one thing id like to ask of you very well there isnt time but ill hear this one thi ng there was a wish that i wanted to be granted at any cost its because of the system that asia and xenovia receive damage when they pray to god right the two of them were former believers sometimes they would pray as old habits didnt fade and t hey would receive damage yes if devils or fallen angels pray to god the system moves and decides to give them light damage because this was included in the system with or without gods presence it moves naturally what about it cant you make it s o that there is no damage when only asia and xenovia are
praying that was my wish i was always watching them force a smile but they wanted to pray like normal as expected theyre devils but i think they should be free to have something they believe i n hearing my wish michael san showed a surprised expression was my request strange asia and xenovia who were on either of my sides were also surprised however michael san gave a small laugh and nodded in agreement i understand if its only t wo people i may be able to do something about it the two of them are already devils and cant get near church headquarters asia xenovia let me ask you you know god is absent right even so will you still pray at michaels question the two of them shook their head and then nodded yes i want to pray even if there is no lord me too ill give thanks to the lord to michael sama michael san smiled at both of their responses very well ill do that right away when i return to headquart ers fufufu it should be fine if there are only two devils who dont receive damage when praying how interesting alright he
said it with this you can pray to god without problems asia though he doesnt exist asia became teary eyed and embrac ed me isesan there there i held her gently im happy for you asia ill exert myself for the sake of asias happiness from now on as well ise thank you xenovia also voiced her gratitude i gently stroked the heads of both asia and xenovia its fine you can pray without restraint from now on did xenovias cheeks turn slightly red because she was embarrassed hahaha dont worry about it michael sama about the aforementioned matter please do as you said kiba requested something to mic haelsan following your advice i swear on the holy demonic sword you gave us that i will not allow holy sword research to produce any more victims it was a huge error for us to flatly reject important believers to this extent ooh michael san so you would also go that far rather just when did kiba have such a talk with michael san thats great kiba yeah thank you ise kun azazel spoke to michael as they pleasantly watched our exchange michael ill leave the explaining to the valhall a
guys to you after all it would be problematic for me to move imprudently afterwards youll have to convey what happened today to mt sumeru20 as well yeah since there would be no persuasive power if either the governor of the fallen angels or the maou explained things ill have to tell them im accustomed to reporting to god after all leaving it at that michael san took a great numb er of his subordinates and flew to heaven azazel declared ahead to the fallen angel troops i have chosen peace the fallen angels wont fight with the angels and devils at all from now on those who are dissatisfied with this may leave however ill ki ll you without reservation the next time we meet only those who want to follow may come with me we will live for the sake of governor azazel till the day we die the subordinates loyalty became a roar azazel saw this and expressed his gratitude with a small thank you what incredible charisma after azazel issued orders to his troops the fallen angels deployed magic circles and returned the devil troops also seemed to be transferring through magic circles the school grounds
that had been crowded with all those troops became rapidly desolate and then only the few people gathered with us were left azazel the only fallen angel left let out a big breath and left in the direction of the school gate ill leave the cleaning up to sirzechs im tired so im heading back he tried to wave his hand and head back but he stopped just once and pointed his finger at me thats right sekiryuutei since i plan to stay here for a little while ill help that bishop of rias gremory i cant stand seei ng a sacred gear that cant be controlled eh that was my idiotic voice what did you say just now mr governor for the red its women for the white its power either one is so purely simple that its shocking saying just that azazel then le ft while whistling at that time i thought azazels words were just a joke july 20xx ad heavens representative head angel michael governor azazel of the fallen angel central organisation grigori the underworlds representative maou sirzechs lucifer with these representatives of the three great powers a peace treaty was signed thereafter disputes between the
three great powers were prohibited in the framework of cooperation this treaty adopted its name from our school which became its stage and was called the kuoh treaty new life and so from today on ill be the advisor of this occult research club please call me azazel sensei or governor is fine too wearing a worn out suit azazel was in the clubroom of the occult research club why are you here touching her forehead with her hand buchou was in a perplexed state hah i was requested to take this position by serafalls little sister well its because im a super cool guy i score even with schoolgirls thats forbidd en or rather why would sona do such a thing youre so stubborn rias gremory i was told by serafalls sister that this was requested by sirzechs thats why she requested me you were requested as an advisor for such a thing the presidents intentions couldnt be understood wait what about that arm didnt you lose one of them i pointed at azazels no at senseis arm im sure that it was cut off that time ah this its a genuine artificial arm that i produced while researching
sacr ed gears its an all purpose arm that can be loaded with light power style laser beams and tiny missiles i wanted to be equipped with such a thing once i equipped it in commemoration of my lost arm bashu azazels senseis hand flew out it also did s everal rotations as it spun on its side ooh its mechanical the condition for me staying at this school is that i make the immature sacred gears possessed by the devils of the gremory family grow well my knowledge as a sacred gear enthusiast is usefu l after all you guys have also heard about it but there is a weird organisation called the khaos brigade as a future deterrent against them the welsh dragon and your family have become famous rather than that im an expert on the opposing vanishing d ragon from the information i got on him i know that vali has his own team were temporarily calling it the hakuryuukou team several people are gathering around the ones whove been identified at present vali and sun wukong are vali and the others going to attack here again the governor shook his head at my question they
wont attack here again it was a rare chance for an assassination on the leaders of the three great powers at the conference but that also failed their current opponents are heaven and the underworld in the underworld all the fallen angels under my orders have joined together with the devils the underworld wont fall so easily the seraph guys in heaven also wouldnt remain silent also there are the free loading strong s acred beasts in heaven and demonic beasts as well so its a war no its still at the skirmish level you could say both they and us are in a preparatory period dont worry something like war wont occur until you people graduate from universit y let alone this schools high school division enjoy your school life fully however it is the long awaited preparatory period so youll be doing various preparations right well tilting my head in puzzlement i racked my brains and tried to thi nk of something to say but nothing special came to mind sekiryuutei dont think about it too hard either way since you lack brains youll make no progress if you worry too much your enemy is the hakuryuukou vali
to the bitter end just dont forget that single fact i see so my enemy is that guy its better if i understand just that clearly not only did he look down on me and those around me he also made a fool of me next time we meet ill hit him hard with my own power you were only able t o repel vali because you combined the dragon slaying sword you got from michael with boosted gears power also vali didnt go all out if it werent for that you would have lost rather you could only fight thanks to the compatibility this time if it was another opponent that wasnt a dragon and possessed power of valis level you would have been killed it was exactly as azazel said i couldnt have fought so well if i didnt have this sword the dragon slayer is versatile also can you use the ha kuryuukous power because of that azazel asked this no it doesnt function at all i had obtained the power to halve my opponent at great pains but the gauntlet that had been lodged in my right arm hadnt appeared since then was it a one
time use only as i thought you cant handle something that strong so easily its beneficial to take in another dragons power however its an entirely different matter whether you can freely control it or not if used unskilfully it may be an ability that i s more difficult than attaining balance breaker however the power you took in once should have been recorded into ddraigs soul the rest depends on training in addition youll first have to complete hellish training in the long term if youre weak bu t in absurdly high spirits youll die im sorry that im fundamentally weak governor damn it even though i stole albions power theres no point if i couldnt use it freely well i couldnt even control ddraigs power it was still impossible for t he current me your sekiryuutei power is also too unstable its explosive power is tremendous but thats also only temporarily a lower rank opponent would instantly be brought down with that but it would be suppressed by a higher rank opponent if you re also going to participate in the rating games as a devil from now on you must stabilise the sekiryuuteis mighty power for all
that you first need to attain balance breaker having said that rating games arent straightforward either something like a pawn that consumed only one piece taking down the king also happens everything depends on how you fight ill have to teach you all about that as well you seem well informed about rating games devils arent the only fans of the game you know th anks to the peace pact there are also a lot of angels and fallen angels going out to watch the games unreservedly sooner or later wont all the angels and fallen angels be giving participation requests as well therefore for the time being well build up your body so that it can fight for long periods of time yes thats exactly right my power really is something temporary if i participate in the games in the future ill need to fight for long periods of time ill have to maintain that power for longer than a tenth of a second rather can i really attain the perfect balance breaker since ive only forcefully achieved it until now with borrowed power i cant imagine attaining it with my own power because im fundamentally weak im a
former human vali is a maous descendent these are the backgrounds weve had from birth huh can i become strong that was my question it was a straightforward question could i really become strong ill make you strong since im a fallen angel w ith free time azazel showed a complacent and mischievous smile i guess i have no choice but to believe in this governor well my power depends on my training from now on then i pointed at gasper if for example were attacked another time cant w e do something with gaspers time stopping power ssssssssssssssenpai w wwwwwwwhat are you sayiiiiiiing hiiiiii gasper cried and shouted at my suggestion its not worth considering if hes alone we dont know what kind of peopl e are in the khaos brigade ara ara how piercing certainly vali was also saying that gasper was full of weak points im sorry im sorry im so useless im not useful at all im garbage im pig food im seriously reflecting deeper than the sea and i possess a target higher than evereeeeeeeeeest so please dont abandon meeeeeeeee gasper took refuge in his cardboard box while crying hey hey you need to graduate
from the cardboard box thats right holy demonic sword kid how long can you f ight in balance breaker kiba answered azazels question currently one hour is my limit thats not good at the very least you need to make sure that youre able to continue using it for three days ooh how strict kibas expression also became f ired up from the words just now ii can only do it for ten seconds under restricted conditions the governors eyes became half closed as i timidly spoke youll have to retrain from scratch the hakuryuukou can stay in balance breaker for one month thats the difference between you one month it was a clear and overwhelming difference from my ten seconds but now that i could see my objective it was easy to understand next azazels gaze turned towards akeno san you still hate us dont you baraqiel thats the name of akeno sans father i see so akeno sans father is azazels subordinate akeno san answered with a stern expression i have no intention of forgiving him its that persons fault that my mother died akeno when you f ell down to being a devil he said nothing naturally
that person isnt in a position where he can say something to me thats not what i meant no well it might be thoughtless of me to enter into the space of you parent and child i dont consider that person as my father akeno san declared that clearly i see however i dont think its bad that you joined the gremory family if things were otherwise what would baraqiel think i wonder akeno san did not respond to azazels wor ds she just silently showed a complicated expression then azazels eyes turned to me this time hey sekiryuutei is ise fine ise your dream is to make a harem right yeah thats right yes a harem is my final goal my dream however recen tly i feel like that dream is quite far away ever since i discovered that im bad at handling girls shall i teach you about harems even though i look like this im a man who has formed hundreds of harems in the past you know you wont lose anythin g by hearing about it what governor sssssssseriously yeah seriously are you a virgin yyes all right ill also teach you about women its better
to become a man that properly ensnares even beautiful women the story of how i f ell like this was because i rubbed the breasts of human women i dont compromise when it comes to ero yyou fell for such a thing eh seriously buchou nodded at my question with a fed up face really according to legend the leaders of the grigo ri were tempted by human women and fell for teaching them valuable knowledge from heaven azazel smiled as he heard that we were young back then too we blindly believed that god was great and god was wonderful with our virginity standing out hah aha after we lost to temptation in the end and had sex with women we lost our virginity and also lost our place in heaven amazing the leaders of the fallen angels were all lewd people that goes beyond being bad people ah somehow im suddenly fee ling sympathy for the fallen angels ooh you really are sensible arent you thats right if youre a man live in a state of desire devour women if you sleep with them and have sex strength will follow along with confidence i shall handle your g
raduation ceremony ill introduce you to some beautiful fallen angel women among my subordinates theyd also probably be happy to have sex if their partner is a legendary dragon beautiful fallen angel women i suddenly remembered raynare no no th ere wouldnt be any more bad women like that or rather thats what i want to believe however i dont think such a thing will happen again uooooo seriously i can graduate i will follow you sensei thats right this person is my teacher azazel sensei my teacher the great teacher who will teach me about sacred gears and women the teacher i wanted oh i see all right then well go out on a virginity graduation tour what is that that dream likesounding tour thats way more fascinating than an all youcaneatcrab tour ill participate ill certainly participate if there is an annual participation fee ill collect and pay it please let me participate on that tour for eternity seeing my eyes light up buchou became flustered pplease wait a moment azazel please dont give ise strange ideas gyuh buchou embraced me and made sure i didnt come into contact with azazel its fine isnt it at this age
its perfectly healthy to be acquainted with one or two women or is th ere something wrong with your servant being acquainted with women im the one who manages ises chastity ise what do you mean by getting rid of your chastity at another place after you protected someone elses chastity seriously my virginity is b eing managed by buchou isesan do you mean to leave me and go somewhere far away asiachan are you misunderstanding the tour ill always be with asia ara ara ise kun ill be lonely if you participate on the tour akeno san please dont h ave such a sorrowful expression i wont be able to go ise senpai is the worst au im sorry koneko chan however koneko chan isnt angry shes laughing if buchou is managing it it wont be easy to produce a child muu xenovia youre seri ously worrying about it you sure are popular ise senpai as a hikikomori i admire you now you cant speak ill of me any more can you so said gasper and kiba i dont really understand it but gasper please graduate from your cardboard box the good looking guy can die watching this scene
azazel sensei laughed heartily hahaha whats with this i see i see thats right dragons naturally form polygamies so you dont require my teaching well this place has become a location for represen tatives from the three way alliance the governor of the fallen angels the maous little sister backup from the angels side and a legendary dragon lets all get along from now on the current objective is for the sekiryuutei to perfect balance break a nd for all of you to power up you should train and achieve that during summer vacation summer vacation thats right the first school term is ending soon even so its scary how this fallen angel governor has fitted in normally before we noticed it even though he was the leader of an enemy organisation until now the future really doesnt look so bad we also have to become stronger too azazel also agreed with buchous words it doesnt hurt to become stronger so according to what ive heard theres going to be a meeting of young devils in a few days right i heard rias gremory was included among the names of promising young devils that are close to debuting yes noble
families and old families meet together with several young devils it s eems to be a custom is it fine to think about games at a time when a terrorist attack occurred that was my question was it really fine even though a strange organisation had come sensei was the one who answered that i in fact recommend it battle s in the games will be good experience for current young devils without previous battle experience its because the present devils are crowded together with reincarnated devils of humans fallen angels and demonic beasts they are troubled by their oppone nts abundant battlefields have been established and fighting methods have come in an infinite variety responding to that there isnt a more favourable environment for training young people than this unexpectedly sirzechs and the others have looked at t he current situation with the future in mind when they created these games they make them compete with other devils and the quality of power is raised since theyre a greedy group it fits them what crafty guys they are i dont really understand it we ll but basically hes saying that they gain battle experience in the games so as
not to lose to terrorism either huh certainly itd be a problem if the inexperienced were suddenly thrown into the battlefield dont worry ill drive into you how to u se your personal power and your sacred gears power and there are plans for the matches to be set during your training camp as well i believe theyre doing it in rating game style ive already finished probing sirzechs about it azazel sensei you seri ously seem to like preparing for this is it really that fun kukuku theres the boosted gear which has begun an unknown evolution and theres also the holy demonic sword furthermore theres the forbidden balor view ill drive my research results into them and explore their original evolved forms uwah sensei is giving out a dangerous laugh and thoughts are we experimental bodies with so many difficulties ahead i fear for the future what will happen to kuoh academy and the occult r esearch club kuoh academy end of first semester kuoh academy senior high school occult research club advising teacher azazel fallen angel governor president rias gremory king third year student remaining pieces 1 rook vicepresident himejima akeno queen third year student club members
toujou koneko rook first year student kiba yuuto knight second year student xenovia knight second year student asia argento bishop second year student gasper vladi bishop first year student hyoudou issei pawn second year student grigori2 sorry for contacting you like this shemhaza so thats why ill be staying here for a while understood however azazel there are also subordinates who dont think kindly of you for this peace its fine it doesnt matter leaving that aside its you that im worried about your kid will be born right azazel ii take good care of that devil wife of yours shes a good woman for coming this far to b e with you even though she might be killed your child will become the bridge between devils and fallen angels i would have been happy if i alone had been resented f for you to be so dont cry my comrade im used to being resented leave the matter of akeno to me as well ill shoulder everything with these twelve black wings so just be silent and follow me shemhaza yes my master valhalla and that is the report from michael dono odin sama these youngsters have sprung back
up its a bold thing pretending to be god that damn michael what shall we do it was unexpected that the god recorded in the holy bible has died really with that youngster michael that fake lucifer and that naughty kid azazel it s a play gathering of little brats then shall we teach those youngsters what we the asgard the true gods are like freyr i wont be able to respond to a war engulfing the world after so long with my old body however the earnestness of these you ngsters is interesting ill go watch the rating games of the devils they do seem interesting dont they it does seem fun the struggling of these youngsters who have lost their god now then what will they do from now on special life the day before we entered summer vacation that is after the closing ceremony had ended hello hi ill be imposing on you from today on akeno san and xenovia came to my house carrying some big luggage right after akeno san greeted me isekun she embraced me owah so suddenly i akeno have arrived here at your side just now ise kun pplease dont look at
me with such teary eyes my chest tightened aakeno and xenovia will also be living together with us in this house i it was oniisamas suggestion koneko also plans to come later so said buchou who somehow seemed to feel regretful about it according to the story sirzechs sama apparently proposed this for the sake of improving the physical relationship of our family it was said that buchou resisted it till the end but my parents had consented to it and the moving in of akeno san and xenovia had been arranged so as soon as akeno san arrived at my house she clung t o me like glue and wouldnt let go uu im happy but the looks that buchou and asia are giving me are painfulor perhaps i should say scary akeno san arent you enjoying this situation the feeling of your breasts is wonderful but isekun i ll sleep together with you tonight ufufu i want to do things with ise kun in bed all night just once seriously uooooo n nosebleed asia is it fine if i share the same room as you xenovia tried to confirm this but that asia was looking at me and
akeno san with watery eyes ooh it seems ill be scolded by asia later buchou sighed while pinching my cheek it hurts onee sama however this house has rather become small hasnt it ive decided ill reconstruct it during summer vacation i ll get in touch with my brother eeeeeh what will happen to the hyoudou household from now on with this and that the first school semester came to a close next is summer vacation playing all day long as much as i like since im living together w ith buchou and the others various things are bound to happen to me according to the plan this plan might not come to be probably after all i was buchous servant akeno sans pet kouhai and asias onii san damn it even though summer is the importa nt season where its possible for male high school students to graduate from being a virgin i dont want to hear the bragging of my class boys who have graduated after summer ends i dont think its possible but if im beaten to the punch by matsuda an d motohama ill have no confidence in living ah that mufufu pink life its receding
because of my training however i have to become strong i have to get closer to vali by even a little and if im going to survive as a devil from now on powerin gup is required if i want a harem first i need physical strength however during summer vacation i want to have sex with buchooooooooooou afterword breasts come in various shapes and sizes and the demands for them are also consequently varied autumn reading theres for example book reports i might be called to the teachers office its been a while its ishibumi the hikikomori vampire gasper has finally appeared the mysterious bishop that was hinted at in the first volume has appeared h ere being a cross dresser hikikomori and vampire hes full of materials the fallen angel governor azazel has become the advisor of the occult research club i put him in because i wanted a strong and cool explanation character in the end he has the r ole of a coach so he wont be participating in the rating games the knght figrehead teacher position hes for the few female readers along with kiba the rival vali hes a character that amazingly blows away
the settings common sense but thats e xactly why he becomes a contrast with the ordinary high school student ise this time he got beaten up because he touched a taboo breasts for ise well vali is at fault for that akeno also seriously entered into the competition for ise in this fourth volume rias cant be careless either both onee samas will do this and that around ise and xenovia too asia will also feel anxious the dream of living together is stormy and full of drama in this volume the first school semester story ended next volume is the summer vacation story and in the volume after that the second school semester story will begin from now on ise will fight his rival vali and buchou will compete with the other young devils in the rating games i think ill draw their forms growing together as written in the afterword of the first volume i had planned from the beginning to introduce the norse mythology the khaos brigade and ises group will rarely come into direct contact with each other they will mainly come into cont act with those of hakuryuukou valis family the white side has legendary
existences besides sun wukong as comrades the white side is full of guys that blow away the settings common sense now for the thanks the fourth volume has come out at last miy amazerosama my main editor h sama please take care of me from now on as well the next volume will be a koneko story training hot springs rating game after winning over akeno the loli is next since there were few battles in the fourth volume id like to mix in the games and have a lot of battles in the next one the fifth volume is planned to be released in winter its before the winter holidays but please expect a warm and hot summer battle then till the fifth volume translator s notes and reference 1 boys love gay 2 jump up another respectable way to call dad in japanese 3 jump up to gulp it down 4 jump up the kanj i for river has 3 strokes hence the comparison 5 jump up in the first i he uses ore a particularly masculine way of speaking in the next i he changes it to jibun which is a softer way of speaking this is

situation as wonderful as this this lewd blessing was more than i deserved but right now there was someone approaching me while squirming inside the light cotton blanket id felt a sense of discomfort and just woke up a little while ago but something moving under the blanket was giving me a uniquely elastic and smooth texture however it was amazingly soft it came all t he way to the vicinity of my chest and when i looked inside the blanket ufufu good morning ise kun a beautiful girl with long black hair akeno san came out from inside the blankeeeeeeeeet himejima akeno senpai the vice president of the occult res earch club i belong to and a third year senpai she was another of my onee sama like existences the other day it was decided that she would be living together with us because of certain reasons because she was always wearing a ponytail her unbound bla ck hair felt sexy to me akeno san was wearing a yukata made of thin fabric she drew near to my side so that she could softly snuggle against me in the space between her thighs and breasts the elastic and soft
sensation of a womans entire body assaulte d me since it was a thin kimono the sensation of akeno san was almost directly transmitted to me damn it akeno sans body has the best softness and to top it all off akeno sans body temperature was making my brain melt as she brought her face near my neck she suddenly stopped moving ive arrived while her sweet voice leaked out akeno san tightly embraced me uwaaah an amazing smell was coming from akeno sans hair and it was stimulating my nostrils to the max chuu as a surprise attack i received a kiss on my neck wait a kiiiiiiiiiiss akeno san clung tightly to me as my brain felt like it would burst all of the sensations of akeno sans body were being transmitted to my bodyyyyyyyyyy my legs and akeno sans soft legs were becoming intertwined rather akeno sans legs had entangled uhee akeno sans thighs were wonderfully squishy and smooth the fingers of our hands also intertwined themselves together amazing this is like one of those lovers inbed scenes that you see in drama s and manga akeno san made her skinny fingertips crawl all over my body
i shivered isekuns body is quite sturdy thanks to you being trained by rias ufufu a mans skin feels better than i imagined or is it because its ise kuns body hey ise kun does my body feel good she blew into the ear of the immobilized me as a finishing blow she was completely enjoying how i couldnt move against the wonderfulness of a womans body yyes akeno sans body is the best ufufu im happy you can enjoy this body even more if you want to you know i also want to know more about ise kuns body though i say that since there is a scary onee san sleeping next to us there may be a limit to it but whether or not we get caught this critical moment is als o fun s sversion akeno san has appeared right from the beginning of the morning really since this person is even more erotic than me this time even i the ero devil couldnt stir in surprise akeno san raised her body just a little and hung over me akeno san looked down on me her black hair fell on top of me then akeno sans face
steadily approached minecould this be though it would be nice if time could just stop like thissomething romantic like that would be nice but as expected the insta nt my and akeno sans lips were on top on each other i heard that voice akeno what are you doing when did you get into this room i timidly turned just my eyes to the side a crimson haired onee sama was glaring at me and akeno san with extreme ly displeased half closed eyes buchou youre scary rias onee sama youre scary akeno san turned towards her so that she could show buchou her hand that was intertwined with mine this is skinship i thought i would have a nice morning with my adorabl e ise kun so i came in after all being in bed alone is lonely buchous eyebrows rose up at that single word used by akeno san uwaaaaah shes snapped my since when did you become ises master buchou spoke as her whole body trembled her mouth twitched even if im not his master im his senpai its a senpais duty to be affectionate with their kouhai right buchou slowly brought her face close to akeno
san once her face was closer buchou spoke in a voice filled with anger senpaii see so thats your reasoning this room is close to being a sanctuary for me my only absolute healing place asia aside i cant have others intrude here this is my and ises room when did my room become buchous room akeno san smiled a little at buchou s words araara the ojou sama has a strong desire to monopolise doesnt she are you perhaps afraid of having it stolen by me looks like i need to discuss this with you once more buchous body was enveloped in crimson aura uwaaaah is she prepa ring for battle ara youre releasing quite an aggressive aura for a discussion arent you smiling akeno san also began to envelop herself in a pale gold aura wha her too its a discussion to the bitter end buchou and akeno san glared at ea ch other while releasing crackling sparks all over the placeuwaaah so a battle between women was starting in the morning right away then am i who was like a pet to them the cause i felt happy but more than that i was scared if these
two usually gentle people glare at each other with demon like expressions ill curl up unyuu is it morning already fuaaaaa and then asia rose up while rubbing her sleepy eyes asia you can go back to sleep i gently stroked asias head aah asia my heali ng space ah ise shanthen ill accept your offer and sleep while being hugged by ise shan the half awake asia tried to go back to sleep while embracing me uu she was extremely adorable but this wasnt the time for this bofu bofu bofun when i lo oked in the direction of the sounds a pillow fight between buchou and akeno san had started nooooow onee samas what are you two doing so early in the morning to begin with i hate how akeno tries to immediately touch my important thing buchou threw the pillow with force and made it hit akeno san right in the face even after the pillow that hit her fell down akeno san still had a smiling face thats what i thought but her eyes were opened widely ara it should be fine if it is just for a bit you really are stingy rias she picked
up the fallen pillow and nailed buchou in the face with it uwaa a direct hit buchou brushed the pillow away from her face her eyes were a bit watery this house was just renovated so i wont let you do as you please akeno finally she threw away all of her appearance and words which had brimmed with elegance and threw the pillow again with the voice and face of a girl her age akeno san dodged the pillow and then threw my own pillow at buchou sirzechs sama said that we should live together and get along with each other this is my and ises house both you and onii sama are in the way of ise and me i cant stand it anymore those words make me extremely happy buchou tears full of emotion came out i m more blessed than i deserve as her servant but those words just now are all just the selfishness of an ojou sama arent they you intend to ignore sirzechs samas wishes so you value ise kun more than maou sama then lend me ise kun for a bit as we ll no absolutely not the two onee samas were
having a quarrel appropriate for girls their age hhmmm since we started living together i had gotten to see buchous and akeno sans true faces butthe two great onee samas who gave off a noble atmosp here everyone admired them i admired them as well however in reality they were ordinary girls who also showed faces appropriate for their age i wasnt particularly shocked about that rather i was happy the noble them were good but them acting a s girls was also cute rather i think i like them like this even more hmm then i felt doubts about some of the details of their quarrel that were mentioned a while ago the house was just renovated now that i think about it the bed looked excessive ly bigsince there was plenty of space left on the bed even though buchou and akeno san were having a pillow fight arerere was my bed always this big so big that there was still enough space even with four people on it rather there was even a canop y as well when i looked around the room carefullyi realised that it was more spacious than before huh it was this spacious
even though my room was only 8 tatami mats2 wide isnt it twice as big now the television had also changed from a small cathode ray tube type to a huge new model flat screen tv aaaaah there were even all the latest kinds of game consoles things that i couldnt buy with just my allowance and part time earnings were in my room i quickly left my room strange it was just my normal house until last night the corridor was twice as spacious as before there were also staircases leading both up and down my house as a twostory building was only supposed to have two floors here there is a third floor now when i took a peek at the staircase somehow it looked like the levels didnt stop at a third floor when i ran down the stairs an amazingly spacious entry hall appeared before me i let out a wheezing breath and when i looked at my entire house from the outside how can this be my house was by the work of a carpenteeeeeer wwhat the hell is thiiiiiiiiiiiiis my scream echoed throughout the neighbourhoo d naturally my house in addition to having more
than twice the plot area had become a six story building life1 its summer break lets go to the underworld part 1 no it was renovated i was also shocked when i got up this morning the house was renovated while we were sleeping breakfast set at the table that had become five times wider than before my father said that while wearing a smile all over his face gathered around the table were all the members of my new family including myself my parents buchou asia akeno san and xenovia i had questioned my father after we began eating the short question whats going on my mother brought in the breakfast miso soup from the kitchen which had also become five times wider apparen tly riass father does work related to construction as well and he said that hed renovate this place free of charge as part of a model house theres no way that kind of story could be true no i could understand it if buchous parents did it it was be cause she knew all this that buchou was eating her meal calmly and silently rather let alone renovating didnt our lot area also expand havent
the neighbouring houses completely disappeared and been turned into the grounds of our new house now that you mention it it seems that suzuki san and tamura san next door have moved away i hear that they suddenly obtained some favourable plots of land and then moved there so said my father buchous family was definitely involved with that there was n o mistake its all right it was a peaceful settlement so that everyone could be happy next to me buchou smiled widely while whispering so this is the negotiation technique of devils since buchou said so the neighbours had surely ended up happy a s well but how dreadful they are the gremory family my mother held out the house blueprints it looked to be the room assignment chart on the first floor are the guest rooms living room kitchen and japanese style rooms on the second floor are the rooms of ise rias san and asia chan the arrangement has the other two adjacent to ises room it seems to be structured so that you can go between the rooms next to each other from inside i see so the second floor was entirely for buchous selfishnes
s uwah my room seems to be more than four times bigger than beforewas the installation of furniture also from the gremorys possessions amazingthere was a huge television id never seen before in the living room there was also a chandelier on the cei ling on the third floor are your fathers and my room the study and the storeroom on the fourth floor are akeno sans and xenovias rooms theres also the room for koneko chan who will be coming later when my eyes met with akeno sans she gave me a full blown smile for some reason that smiling face looked more genuine than the smiles she usually worerecently akeno san has had a wonderfully nice smiling face when with me it was different than her smiling face from before it was difficult to e xplain but could i call it her true smiling face akeno san would show that face to me now i felt closer to akeno san now with her having a much gentler atmosphere compared to before i felt like she wasnt an existence outside of reach anymore though for me she was still someone far beyond my grasp as my heart was pounding
buchou lightly pulled my cheek auu buchou has steadily become more severe tooi have no intention of having any master besides buchou though she worries too much my mother continued her explanation of the room assignments the fifth and sixth floors are entirely made of just vacant rooms for the time being we intend to use them as guest rooms since rias san said she didnt mind letting anyone have the rooms except for the second floor when we asked her yes this is the house of ises mother and father in the end i and the others are just home staying here buchou responded with words overflowing with grace arere buchou didnt you say this is my and ises house earlier in my room what an about face there is also an open air garden on the roof i will be able to plant vegetables my father said that as his eyes lit up aah he has no doubts about it at all theres no mistake that his mind was numbed by the r enovation of his dreams because we built it so sturdily it wont collapse even in the case of a war hahahaha youre quite skilled at
joking rias san this was the conversation between buchou and my fatherwhat if what buchou says really is true t his houses structure was seriously transformed so that it could withstand even a war there couldnt be things like cannons concealed somewhere could there however what did my father and buchous father discuss during the parent visit the other day i m really worried about it they couldnt have agreed on a discussion of selling me completely to the underworld or something could they there was no way that could be but even so i felt that the eyes that my parents looked at me with had changed just a little since the day of that parents visit therere also underground floors apparently xenovia said that while she was having a hard time with her chopsticks underground floors yeah there are up to three underground floors i was the one who cried out wildly buchou nodded and confirmed it this house even has underground floors the first underground floor is a huge spacious room not only can it be used as a training room it can also be used as a movie theatre its also equipped with a l arge
indoor bath the second underground floor is used entirely for an indoor pool it can also use warm water in the third underground floor are a library and a storehouse buchou explained this while taking out additional blueprints so my house even has an indoor pooli dont know whats what anymore since theres also an elevator you can smoothly get on and off from the sixth ground floor to the third underground floor this house also has an elevatorits like a real building i didnt have any words left to say anymore in this way my house was transformed into a palatial residence a few days after summer holidays began youre returning to the underworld breakfast had ended and buchou nodded at me as i sat in my room all the members of the occult research club were gathered in my room all the members who were living together had rough appearances kiba koneko chan and gasper had arrived at my house just a little while ago as well the first two were wearing casual clothes koneko chan in a one piece dress looked cute even with this many people here there was plenty of extra space in my room
everyone sat on expensive looking sofas only gasper got into a cardboard box he brought along buthe was dressed in girl clothes thats also as usual yeah the cross dressing boy im returning home now that the summer holidays have started i do this every year wait whats wrong ise your eyes are teary i shed tears at buchous words uu because buchou suddenly started talking about returning to the underworld i thought of you leaving me behind and going back i dont want that i dont want buchou to leave me behind and go back when i think of buchous breasts going somewhere far away i feel sad and i wont be able to spend my s ummer holidays peacefully i cant imagine life without buchou anymore geez is that all you and i will be together for hundreds for thousands of years from now on so put your mind at ease i wont do something like leaving you behind buchou then ga ve a wry smile while rubbing my cheek i see we are devils we live longer than humans so buchou and i as well as the other club members will be together for a long time
when i think of that i dont feel lonely at all surely ill live much longer t han matsuda motohama or my parents when i think of it like that it seems lonelythat separation that must eventually come buchou gracefully drank tea as she said that wait were also going to the underworld eh were going to the underworld too thats right since youre all servant devils in my family its only natural for you to accompany your master youre coming to my home together with me now that i think of it this is also the first time for asia and xenovia right asia nodded at buchous question yyes im nervous about going to hell while alive i i thought id like to go there with the intention of dying asia i dont understand what you mean at all yes ive been interested in the underworld in hell for a long time how ever for the sake of going to heaven i had to serve the lordbut now that im a devil there shouldnt be any possibility of me going to heaveni feel irony in setting foot in the same world as those who have been sent to hell
as divine punishment hell huh it suits a former believer who became a devil ah youre once again becoming depressed over futile worries xenovia we will spend the remainder of the summer holidays there until after the 20th of august it seems like well be returning here at the end of the month the plan is to train and attend various kinds of events at the underworld buchou thus told us the schedule i see so our group is going to spend time in the underworld until the end of summer i went to the underworld for a little bit during the battle with the phoenix familyi dont know anything about it besides the fact that the sky there is purple also it seems to be the place where the souls of the dead arrive at as well and the field of business management also seems to be popular there but if i spend the summer holidays there wont the schedule that i made fail ah but there are things i want to do this summer i let out a sigh as i spoke the three of us me matsuda and motohama all powerfully promised each other this year lets
get girlfriends and have ero ero experiences during the summer we would go to the sea and to the pool this summer where we would pick up girls or that was what we decided i didnt have a girlfriendi had one before but i was killed by my former girlfriend ill enjoy myself this summer or so i had thought ara ise did you also have plans to go somewhere buchou asked me that dubiously yes i was going to go to the sea and the pool there arent any seas in the underworld b ut there are huge lakes there are also pools in this house and at my parents home as well you know theres also hot springs there but is that no good if i thought about it wouldnt i get tens and hundreds of times more enjoyment at the underworld l akes and pools with buchou and the others than going with matsuda and motohama to the sea moreover theres hot springs over there inside my brain i fantasised about the stark naked forms of buchou akeno san asia xenovia and koneko chan going inside the steam a b bbbreasts steam festival applying oil and peeping
into the hot springsor will it be mixed baths i want to rub buchous and akeno sans breasts and massage them fully with my hands disgusting delusions are prohibited i was ver bally jabbed at by koneko chan with half opened eyes as expected of koneko sama she really can see into my mind after she jabbed at me koneko chan let out a deep sigh and for some reason looked off with distant eyes huh now that i think about it he r tsukkomis sharpness seemed slightly weaker than usual3 isekun you have a face that is hornier than i could imagine you seem to have an abundant imagination and seem to be enjoying yourself senpaii envy you kiba spoke refreshingly and gasper murmured in what seemed to be envy from the depths of his heart why dont you guys go on dates with girls this summer those two have better f aces than me if you had those intentions couldnt you enjoy the best summer its because i have training you damn mr diligent kiba deserves to be punished for not putting his good looks to good use im fineim a hikikomori so im fine if i sta
y indoors and put on cute clothes while surfing the net at my house you damn hikikomori cross dresser gasper is useless from head to toe hes a useless child just waiting for a tsukkomi then ise go on a date with me in the underworld there should be time for just a date as a servant i cried at buchous proposal buchou really does spoil me buchoooooou ill come ill come with all my strength araara in that case ill spend time with ise in the bedroom while doing ecchi things that buc hou cant seem to do akeno san spoke while lewdly tracing around her chest with her finger buh blood spurted from my nose at akeno sans stimulating words thats erotic thats sexy akeno onee sama just what kinds of things will you do to me in the bedroom i forbid it i refuse buchou and akeno san locked eyes on each other as sparks flew aaaaah theyve resumed the fight from earlier this morning why do these two quarrel over their affection for their kouhai im also going to the underw orld before we became aware of it a good looking black haired man was sitting
on a seat in the corner it was azazel sensei all the club members were taken aback by senseis sudden appearance as the governor of the fallen angel organisation that opposed the devils he had been present at the peace conference the other day between devils angels and fallen angels for some reason only this person stayed at kuoh academy and started as a teacher there whats more hes now the advisor of our occul t research club it was an unimaginable situation just from the face of it seriously where did this person come in from i didnt sense his presence at all or rather i was ignorant when it came to that field even so not even buchou or kiba had notice d him well since he was the fallen angel governor he would be a last boss like existence depending on the situation its amazing that we have such a person as an ally wwhere did you come in from buchou asked that to sensei while blinking in surpri se hmm isnt it normally from the front door sensei answered calmly i didnt even feel your presence kiba voiced his feelings honestly as i thought even kiba
who had attained balance breaker couldnt sense him thats just due to your lack of training i just came in normally more importantly youre returning to the underworld right then ill go too im your teacher after all yes he had taken up the role of our teacher since he has an abundance of knowledge on sacred gears it se ems hell be teaching us our battle styles from now on he had only taught us a little so far but it seemed like the sacred gear owners in this group including me had managed to grasp something thanks to him more than just using power or leading this person was certainly good at teaching most of all hes amazingly skilled at explaining i think hes definitely suited to be a teacher or lecturer sensei took out a notepad from his pocket and read out loud as he opened it the schedule for the underwor ld isfirst a visit to riass parents and the introduction of the servant devils to the current head of the family after that theres the annual meeting of new young devils and then theres your training over there im mainly going along with you for
your training while youre all at the gremory house ill be meeting with sirzechs geez so troublesome sensei sighed he seriously finds it bothersome to do i think this governor of an organisation is so bad with that because this person receives a lot of support from his subordinates once in a while fallen angels whose names i didnt know would come to meet with sensei they would say things like please decide on a secretary look after your personal appearance while in the human world or you absolutely need to have personal bodyguards when they visited they all seemed tremendously worried about azazel sensei being in this town i heard there were some top officials among the fallen angels who visited as well he would always send all th ose members back with the words its fine so go back thats an order i think that were lucky to have that kind of fallen angel teaching us how to get stronger alright ill get even a little closer to my rival hakuryuukou vali using this opportuni ty since it seems like ill just be decisively defeated by him as i am nowi absolutely dont want to die before i
do ecchi things with buchou and akeno san then azazel sensei youll be accompanying us right shall we make the travel reservations for you sensei nodded at buchous question yes please do its my first time entering the underworld through the devils route im looking forward to it since i usually use the route of the fallen angels side the underworld huh how will we go the re as expected will it be by magic circle the underworld is divided between the world of the devils and the world of the fallen angels it seems the fence between the two has disappeared with the establishment of peace and cultural interaction has star ted though the ignorant me couldnt imagine that place at all for the time being i sent a mail to matsuda and motohama im passing on going to the beach this summer because im going to the hot springs with buchou and the others they quickly resp onded back die go to hell yeah i am going to hell to the underworld youre surprisingly on the mark my close friends part 2 the day we set off the first place we headed to was the nearest station everyone
was wearing kuoh academys summer unif orm buchou said that if we were entering the underworld this was our best uniform this was the station where people usually took the trainwhy were we going to the underworld from here i was full of questions but buchou and akeno san determinedly hea ded towards the elevator installed within the station i remembered that it was a small elevator that could only hold five people at most buchou and akeno san entered it first and then spoke then please come in first ise asia and xenovia well be g oing down from here ggoing down i was puzzled by buchous words after all this station could only go up come on stop blinking in surprise like that and come in buchou beckoned us while smiling wryly while those of us in the new devils group e xchanged glances with each other we complied with buchous words yuuto and the rest of you who are used to it please come together with azazel afterwards yes buchou kiba answered to buchou and then the elevator doors closed since we had some bi g luggage with us the inside was quite small as a result
as i thought the floor display only had floors 1 and 2 butbuchou took out what seemed to be a card from her skirt pocket and turned it towards an electronic panel pi some kind of electroni c soundit had reacted to the card and then gakun i was seized by a sensation of going down eh there was a bottom asia and i couldnt hide our surprise xenovia just tilted her head as a small reaction buchou and akeno san saw the shocked state of asia and i and giggled a little at us beneath this station there is a secret level buchou even though i grew up in this town this is the first time im hearing of such a thing thats only natural its a route that is exclusively for devils o rdinary humans cant arrive here even if they struggle their whole lives areas for the exclusive use of devils are hidden within the town in this way you know there seems to be many places i dont know about in my town just how far has the devils bus iness world penetrated into this town we kept descending for another minute at last the elevator
stopped after the doors opened buchou urged us forward with a go ahead and what confronted my sight as i went out first was a vast artificial space it was some kind of huge cave rather it seemed to have the structure of a station platform though there were a few differences from the design and structure of those in the human worldwait there were train tracks as i thought is this a station after we waited a little we were also joined by kiba and the others from the elevator now that all of us are here well walk to platform three with buchou and akeno san in the lead we began to walk hah but what a vast space i felt that this place was s everal times the size of the station we usually used the ceiling above was also distant it seemed like your voice would echo if you yelled out hey there was no one else here besides us the wall lamps that illuminated this place gave off a magic like mysterious glow before i realised it akeno san came to my side and suddenly grasped my hand does she intend to walk while holding
hands i was shocked but for some reason i grasped her hand back like i always did with asia though that was all i di d akeno sans face turned red and seemed happy eh is this okay aaaaah but when she has such a girlish reaction even i dont know what i might do even though she is usually very erotic she sometimes acts like a young girl that difference provoke s my male instincts sob uu buchou and asias gazes were sharpasia even had teary eyes sorry asia after taking passages left and right we came out into an open space again oh ooooooh there was what seemed to be a train in front of us i say seemed to because its form was more peculiar than the trains i knew there were many devil representing patterns carved into it at acute anglesah its the gremory pattern and there was also sirzechs samas pattern could this be its a train ow ned by the gremory family buchou answered without hesitation amazing so the gremory family also owns trains bushu while i was surprised the train doors opened automatically with buchou in the lead we entered the train i
had once again reconfirmed my masters huge scale but that was just the prologue riiiiiiiiiiiing the departure whistle sounded and the train began to move we had gone to sit down in the centre of the train buchou was in the first train car ahead of us and it appeared that the rest of our group had to sit in the central train car behind it i thought that there were surprisingly minor customisations asia and i sat together on the seats facing away from the trains motion and akeno san and xenovia took the seats facing us koneko chan gasper and kiba took the seats next to us and there was azazel sensei sitting at the end of the car but he had already entered sleep mode the train started running for several minutes the train advanced down the dark tunnel id been told that this train was powered by a unique fuel that existed in the underworld there were a lot of things i didnt know about the world werent there how long till we get there i asked akeno san that well arrive in about an hour since it seems that this train passes through the dimensional
barrier using official means before it eventually arrives at the underworld i thought that we could just jump with a magic circle and enter the underworld like that usually thats fine but if ise kun and the other new household devils dont enter at least once by the official route youll be punished for illegally entering thats why ise kun and the others have to properly finish the official entry procedure eh seriously but ive jumped using the mag ic circle and entered buchous engagement party before yes i had entered buchous engagement party in the underworld with a transfer magic circle given to me by grayfia san was i going to be punished there wouldnt be any police who were going to cu ff me as soon as i arrived at the underworld right akeno san gave a small smile despite my worries it seems that was a special case because you were transported with sirzechs samas back door magic circle you know of course doing it twice is imposs ible iis that soso my instant ticket to jail for going there has been pardoned i was a little relieved its because im ignorant of the rules of devils
even though im a devil myself not only was i unskilled my devil knowledge was even more limit ed than asia and xenovia i had survived up to now like this since it was a special case the matter of the back door magic circle is fine however you may be punished for sexual contact with your master akeno san touched her cheek with her hand and s aid this while giggling what hey hey hey its quite serious if thats true i had touched buchous body a fair amount you know i had rubbed her breasts several times and had stroked her thighs several times as well at the school pool before su mmer vacation id also applied oil all over her bare body you know ah this is bad i was being stimulated from remembering that sensation buchous body had been so soft and smooth and yet it had been elastic too so it was amazing when i touched he r skin fuwa while i was repeating that delusion someone had gotten on my lap wait akeno san she was bringing her face close and was looking at me with an erotic gaze akeno san took my hand
and theres no problem with skinship between servants li ke this she guided my hand to her thiiiiiighs nuha akeno sans leg had the best softness and affected my brain a nosebleed spurted out and then my hand was led to under her skirt t thats forbidden territoryi gulped because because if i keep go ing like this my hand will reach into her skirtit will reach akeno sans panties was she fine with that was akeno san okay with me going all the way to her panties the instant my hand went beneath akeno sans skirt asias hand appeared from the si de and grabbed my hand with a tug asia appealed with teary eyes as her mouth pouted in the shape of the he character4 akeno sans influence is too strong ise san will become a pervert araara asia chan isnt it healthy for young men to be a bit perverted arere based on the conversation just now had it been decided that i was a pervert but if i can touch akeno sans body i dont mi nd being a pervert ara koneko chan would usually make a sharp retort at this timing butwhen i looked over
at her i saw koneko chans form looking out the window she was completely ignoring us even though we were making so much noise she doesnt seem to be the usual koneko channext to her gasper also seemed to have trouble speaking out and then look whos talking asia generally skinship between master and servant is quite natural this voice iswhen i turned my gaz e my master was there a red aura enveloping her entire body she was angry and extremely pretty why was she here didnt she have to be in the first train car ahead bbuchou this is bad akeno san was on my lap while having a lewd look on her face my hand was on the verge of venturing inside her skirt i tried to free my hand but akeno san brought my hand to her mouth nuchu my middle finger made a watery sound and went inside akeno sans mouth uhaa the sensation of the inside of a girls mout h made my brain melt it was warm and slippery and furthermore my finger was wrapped around by her tongue moreover she sucked it it seemed like various things were being sucked up when
akeno san pulled my finger out from her mouth a trail of saliva could be erotically seen connecting to my finger stealing from the master gets me fired up akeno san smiled at buchou with a defiant gaze s scary erotic but scary aakeno thats en princess rias communication with your servants is fine but i snt an example of procedure also good buchous angry voice was interrupted and a third person had unexpectedly appeared it was an elderly man he had the appearance of a train conductor was he the conductor his white beard was dandy iim sorry hohoho for the little princess to be concerned with the topic of men and women ive lived a long life buchous face turned a deep red at the mans happy laugh taking off his hat again he bowed his head to us nice to meet you all of the princess new servant devils i am reynaldo the conductor of the gremory private train pleased to make your acquaintance we also stood up and bowed at his polite greeting nnice to meet you as well i am buchou rias gremory samas pawn hyoudou issei plea se treat me well im asia argento
her bishop please treat me well im xenovia knight please treat me well from now on all us new devils greeted him akeno san had also returned to her seat before i was aware of it she seemed a bit disappoi nted at having to part akeno sans ero attack was dreadful even i couldnt move could my chastity be stolen before i know it shes amazing our queen though her occasional girlish behaviour was even more intense with the greetings finished the co nductor reynaldo san took out a unique machine for some reason and captured us on what seemed to be a monitor uumm me asia and xenovia were troubled by this reaction buchou and akeno san seemed to know what it was this is a machine from the devi l world that checks and compares you the fact that this train is formally entering the underworld is important and therefore all modes of transport require inspection it would be a serious matter in the case that there is some fabrication in the current time it would be quite serious if someone occupied the train i see so he was confirming whether we were the real thing with
that machine buchou told us while smiling your records give your piece designations and when transmitted it is registered a s data in the underworld thats why they check it with this machine theres no problem since everyone here is who they say they are though she said that it let out a bi bi alarm over me which didnt mean impostor right i was slightly afraid but then it let out a light pikon sound and our checking was passed princess with this both the checking and the formalities for the entry of the new faces here are finished now you can all rest and relax until we arrive at the scheduled station there are also beds to sleep in and places where you can have a meal so please use them until we reach our destination reynaldo san smiled pleasantly ooh so our entry is finished with that that machine really is convenient thank you reynaldo is a zazel next buchou turned to look at sensei but he was sleeping soundly what nerve that guy has sleeping in the train of a race that were his enemies till just the other day buchou had a face of amazement
but she was smiling a little hohoho t he governor of the fallen angels really is peaceful reynaldo sama also laughed pleasantly really whether you call him courageous or just audacious azazel sensei was a fallen angel governor that got agitated by nothing the check was finished while sen sei kept sleeping and the safe entry process of all club members was completed part 3 about forty minutes after our departure we heard an announcement while we were killing time by playing cards we will momentarily be breaking through the dimensional wall we will momentarily be breaking through the dimensional wall try looking outside buchou said this to me asia and xenovia originally buchou seemed to have had to sit in the front train car as a high class devil but she seemed to have been lon ely by herself and had passed the time in our car instead following buchous words i pushed my face against the window along with asia and then the scenery changed from the darkness of before and a landscape appeared ooh a purple sky and also mountains and trees too hahahaha amazing amaziiiiiiiing i unintentionally babbled excitedly in a loud voice but next to
me asia was also feeling excited with her cries of amazing amazing because were having fun naturally because there was t he landscape of a world we didnt know there its fine if you open the window now buchou had given permission so i opened the window wind came in i had also breathed in the air of the underworld last time but it was somehow different from that of t he human world rather than a slimy kind of feeling i felt something peculiar however the temperature outside was just right i felt neither hot nor cold when i took my face away from the window and looked back it seemed that the train had come out of what appeared to be a black hole thats the dimensional wall the dimensional tunnel at any rate that seems to be a hole that connects to the human world we came out from there and now weve entered the underworld i could see the landscape of the underworld from my seat there were mountains and rivers as well trees also grew in abundance and there were even forests ah a town there are houses too they had a peculiar shape but
devils lived in them right amazing thinking about it i hadnt gone abroad before this might be my first time coming in contact with a foreign culture and country its hard to believe that my first cultural exchange is in another world my life really is strange this area is already within gremory territory buch ou spoke proudly then is everything including these train tracks weve been running on until now on the land of buchous family buchou nodded at my shocked question seriously what a shocking thing so the mountains rivers the town we passed befor e are part of her familys territory then were the people living in that town the vassals of this fiefdom i once more looked at buchou with a look of respect and envy amazing my master was really rich the scale was so different how large is the gre morys territory that was my question to be honest i was very interested in how big it was about the size of the district of tokyo kiba suddenly showed his face over my seat and answered my question if i remember correctly its about the size of h onshu in japan5 eh i couldnt
believe my ears for a moment at that unexpected answer but i soon understood hhonshuuuuuuu i shouted out in a loud voice both buchou and kiba nodded the underworld has the same amount of surface area as the human world but the population here isnt the same as the human world even with devils fallen angels and other races it isnt that high and since there are no oceans the land is also spacious buchou explained that seriously wait just how many times have i used the words seriously and amazing today when hearing such information its only natural to be shocked iin other words if it was in my world the gremorys territory would engulf almost all of japani it must be because buchou is a princess she really is that super rich the scale is also amazing even if you say its the size of honshu isnt it mostly unused space it s mostly just forest and mountains bbuchou even if you say that it already exceeds my imagination and i dont know how to react anymore next to me asia was also in a state of as for xenovia she had stopped considering her surroundings and had
started talking about the swords of the underworld with kiba buchou clapped her hands together as she remembered something thats right ise asia xenovia since part of my territory will be given to you all later please tell me what places you wa nt wwe can have our own territory youre all the servant devils of the next family head living in my territory as part of the gremory group is permitted akeno yuuto koneko and even gasper possess land within my territory with a pon sound buchou made a map appear in the air with magic and then expanded it and showed it to us its geography that i dont know but it seems to be a map of gremory territory buchou spoke with a pleasant smile the red areas are places that have already been taken so theyre no good but anywhere else is okay now then please point at the land you like ill give it to you father mother im having an amazing time in this strange new land part 4 for some ten odd minutes after that the train continued th rough this world that was unknown to me in the end an area that
was abundant with nature such as mountains and lakes was my personal territory well since management of my land was still some time away in the future i finished with just choosing it for now it was then that another announcement came out we will soon be arriving at the gremory main residence we will soon be arriving at the gremory main residence everyone thank you for riding this train ooh its the last stop i stuck my body out from the window and turned my gazed ahead of us thenfor some reason there was a huge crowd of people there whats with that when i strained my eyes i saw that they were soldiers dressed in soldier clothing could these people be the gremory familys troops ise were almost there close the window yyes buchou as suggested by buchou we began to prepare to disembark the trains speed gradually slowed down and eventually stopped gakun after it had quietly stopped we exited from the open d oor with buchou in the lead however only azazel sensei didnt look like he was getting off are youre not getting off sensei yeah i plan to keep going through gremory territory like
this and go to the maous territory i have a meeting with sirz echs and the others there a so called invitation since it faces the main residence of the gremorys ill come after i go see them and finish my greetings azazel sensei waved his hand and explained this i see since sensei is the leader of an organi sation his schedule was busy by coming here then see you later sensei say hi to my brother for me azazel sensei waved his hand in response to my and buchous words the instant that i once again came down to the stations home with the other clu b members minus sensei welcome home rias ojousama such bellowing voices ooh i was surprised soon after that panpanpanpan fireworks were set off soldiers aimed their guns at the sky and fired and people that looked as if they were from an orc hestra band began to play simultaneously a soldier who rode on top of a mysterious creature flew in the sky above and waved a flag asia and i didnt know what to do in the face of this entirely unexpected event and just huddled together as if we were
ou t of place kiba and the others seemed to be accustomed to this but for the new asia and i it was an incredible phenomenon xenovia just kept blinking her eyes hiiiiiiso many people gasper was terrified by the large number of people here and hid beh ind my back looking carefully there were a lot of butlers and maids among them too when buchou approached them they simultaneously bowed their heads and then welcome back rias ojousama they welcomed her thank you everyone im home ive retur ned buchou also responded with a smile covering her whole face seeing that the butlers and maids also smiled back and then a lady with a face i recognised appeared it was the silver haired maid grayfia san welcome back ojou sama you arrived ear ly above all its good that you were safe while traveling now then all family members please board the carriage well be going to the main residence with this we were led by grayfia to a gorgeous looking carriage the horse also didnt seem to be a normal horse as they had a glint in their eyes in its big frame that was sharper than the
ones i knew was this an underworld horse our baggage was still in the train but when i turned my eyes back to the train maids were carrying our baggage out fr om the train ooh so thorough i will go with the servants since ise and asia seem anxious as this is their first time understood ive prepared a few vehicles so please board whichever pleases you grayfia san consented to buchous request me b uchou asia akeno san xenovia and grayfia san boarded the first carriage in front of us the other members who stayed back took the next carriage once we had boarded it the carriage begun to move forward while the horses hooves made the sound of paka rapakara amazing im riding in a carriage for the first time looking at the scenery there were paved roads and beautifully pruned trees the path stretched straight aheadwhat there was something on the path ahead a huge structure suddenly burst int o my view bububububuchouw what is that huge castle i was so shocked that my eyes leapt out of their sockets and i pointed my finger at what seemed to be a huge castle from the window
thats the main residences of one of my homes with a pleas ant smile on her face buchou unexpectedly said one of my homes was i perhaps part of an amazing family of upper class devils looking outside beautiful flowers bloomed water flowed out of a magnificently modelled fountain and birds of various colou rs flew about the carriage was advancing through what seemed to be the garden of buchous home we seem to have arrived after buchou murmured that the carriage door opened a butler like man made a slight bow buchou disembarked first and then the re st of us followed from behind as well the second carriage had also arrived and kiba and the others were getting off too the maids and butlers stood in line on both sides of us and made a path a red carpet stretched out towards the huge castle and the huge castle gate made a gigigi noise as it opened ojou sama and all the members of her group please advance forward grayfia made a slight bow and urged us forward come on lets go it was when buchou started walking on the carpet a small silh ouette broke out from
the line of maids and ran towards buchou rias neesama welcome back a cute looking young boy with red hair embraced buchou millicas im back youve gotten big havent you buchou also lovingly hugged the boy back uumm b uchou who is this child when i asked buchou introduced the boy once more this child is millicas gremory the son of my brother sirzechs lucifer sama hes my nephew sirzechs samas son in other words the maous son uoh isnt he a true prince t hen come on millicas greet them this boy is a new member of my group yes i am millicas gremory nice to meet you ii accept your polite greeting i imno i am hyoudou issei6 uwaaaaaah i was tense and about to blow a fuse with a child smaller than me buchou also spoke while giving an amused smile because only the person himself who succeeded the title of maou can retain the name this child is a gremory even though hes my brothers son hes also next in line for family head after me heh so hes next in line after buchou certainly hes the son of the familys eldest son sirzechs sama may
have left the family but his son i s an heir of the important gremory family rather who was sirzechs samas wife since he has a child he should also have a partner come on lets go into the residence buchou held hands with millicas sama and headed towards the gate asia and i just followed them desperate not to be left behind gasper stuck to my back and didnt let go either we passed through the huge gate and went inside the inner castle gates also opened one by one we then arrived at what seemed to be the entry hall there wer e stairs which led to the second floor in front of us there was a huge chandelier on the ceiling huge this hall was huge so huge that there was room to house an athletics meet ojou sama id like to show everyone to their rooms at once grayfia san raised her hand and some maids gathered with us the maids were all beautiful women was this part of the service youre right i have to go greet mother and father after coming home as well buchou gave a hmm as she seemed to think of
things to do a fter this the master is out at present hes expected to return by this evening he said that he would meet together with you while dining with everyone together at supper i see i understand grayfia then i suppose well let everyone rest in their respective rooms for now has the baggage been carried in already yes there should be no problem with using your room right now ah so we can finally rest somehow my body and mind felt tired after just arriving at this castlewhether it was because i had come to a world i didnt know and shown such unreal things of such a huge scale one after another or not i felt dizzy asia was also unsteady on her feet beside me ara rias so youve returned at that moment a womans voice was heard from abo ve an amazingly beautiful young woman wearing a dress came down the stairs i thought that she wasnt that much older than us her breasts were huge huh she was very similar to buchou the colour of her hair was flaxen but besides that she was almost identical to buchou her eyes were a bit
narrower however could she be riass older sister but the people of riass family basically only had red hairuwah buchous sister was incredibly beautiful i felt like i was in love as soon as she saw that per son buchou smiled mother ive returned home eh m mmmother that beautiful young woman is buchous mmmotheeeeeeeeeeeer but no matter how you look at her this young woman is not that much older than buchou i was shocked to the point th at my eyes bulged and i shouted out unintentionally no no no matter how you look her shes an older sister she doesnt feel like a mother she was more like buchous older sister ara to say such a happy thing that im a young woman buchousmoth er touched her cheek with her hand and smiled uah her smiling face is also pretty as years go by devils can freely change their appearances with magic my mother always has the appearance of the same age as the current me i see i see wait she may be her mother butno matter how you look at her she looks like an onee sama whose age doesnt change that much from buchous
this is bad though my favourite woman is normally buchou i like onee samas even more my heart throbbed buchous breasts wer e inherited from her mother i cried at this wonderful thing hurray for genetics buchou pinched my cheek you know nothing will come out of it even if you make hot eyes at my mother right auu it seems my onee sama read my mindbecause with such a beautiful lady i couldnt help but look ara rias this boy is hyoudou issei right you know about m me me7 buchous mother nodded at m y question yes i snuck a look at your face at my daughters engagement party since im her mother ahthis is bad so she was at that party i was too absorbed in rescuing buchou so i didnt notice i had marched into her daughters important engagem ent party destroyed everything and took buchou away was i going to be scolded or punished i was terrified but buchous mother just gave a small smile nice to meet you im riass mother venelana gremory please treat me well from now on hyoudou isseikun part 5 several hours after that meeting in the entrance hall we
were in the dining room an extravagant meal so large that i could never eat it all was piled on top of expensive looking plates and i didnt know where to start it all seemed so incredibly delicious we servant devils and our master buchou took a seat at the table and then we were followed by buchous father mother and then millicas sama dinnertime i suppose it could be called that apparently there seemed to be night i n the originally sunless and moonless underworld as well the sky was also dark when i looked up at the sky there was a false moon floating up there they said that it wasnt the real one but it had been reproduced using magic the nights darkness in t he underworld was made the same as back home apparently it was originally purple in this world then when i entered this place before it was daytime in this world huh the flow of time here seemed to match the human world it seemed that the underworld had its own flow of time here but it seemed that for the sake of reincarnated devils and those that lived in the human world
the maous had adjusted it to match using a special method so that it wouldnt be an urashima taro situation8 for them the reverse of that as well the fallen angel region of this world also seems to be the same i was relieved that i wasnt in a situation where hundr eds of years have passed when i return or though i was in the underworld for hundreds of years only a few days have passed in the human world please enjoy yourselves without holding back that is how dinner began with a word from buchous father a huge oblong table an extravagant chandelier on the ceiling even the chairs we sat on were covered in expensive looking ornamentsright now i just looked at the chandelier were there chandeliers on the ceilings of guest rooms that had been prepared for u s as well no ordinary lamps seemed nostalgic now the canopy bed was also huge it was too big for just me to sleep in the insides of the rooms were many tatami mats wideeach of the rooms also seemed to have all the necessities needed to live in a bat h toilet refrigerator television and kitchen i
think there were also a bedroom living room and other rooms in themasia and xenovia were also impressed when they came to my place at almost the same time immediately after we had been shown to our roo ms hauuu t this room is way too big for just one person i cant settle down sorry but can i stay in ises room asia can come too for these two who had lived simple lives at the church the size of the rooms seemed to have been a serious shock and because they couldnt calm down about it they had taken their entire luggage to my room and asked to move in after that it was organised so that asia and xenovia would stay in my room through grayfia sans arrangements butwell it still felt like t here was extra space in the room even then so it was fine since i had no confidence that i could use up all that room by myself having more people with me calmed me down i turned my thoughts back to my seat at dinner butno but how i am supposed to e at all this cuisine before me i could ask
all the butlers and maids that were constantly standing behind us but the other club members hadnt asked about anything in particular i held my fork and knife without putting them to the extravagant cooking tha t i beheld for the first time i was hungry but if i ate crudely here buchou would completely lose face ah kiba and akeno san were eating gracefully as expected of the queen and knight asia and xenovia were also having a hard time though they st ill looked good these two had like me introduced themselves in this place not that long ago because we were newcomers little millicas sama was eating skilfully as i thought hed been trained in this as someone from an ordinary household i couldnt follow the life style of the aristocracy at all when i casually turned my gaze to gasper in front of me he was eating with watery eyes that were squeezed shut today may have been a tough day for the hikikomori after coming to a place with lots of peop le here in the underworld koneko chan hadnt starting eating at all even though usually she would have been the first to heartily
dig into the mealkoneko chan had been acting strange somehow since the other day our eyes met and i waved my hand but she averted her eyes while remaining expressionless she always showed little emotion on her face but there was even less reaction than usual muu whats wrong koneko chan azazel sensei hadnt made it for the meal it seems that the meeting couldnt h elp lasting a long time clear throat members of rias group please think of this place as your home having just come to the underworld youre in an environment you dont understand if theres something you want please say so to the housemaids wit hout reserve theyll prepare it right away buchous father cheerfully told us this no theres nothing in particular that i want anymore ah is it okay if i borrow the maid onee sans for a night i want ecchi service from the maids of course itd be the best if they could attend to me all night as if ive been looking at too many galge9 and manga havent i by the way hyoudou issei kun buchous father turned to face me uwah im nervous what will he ask yyes
however the topic buchous father brought up was unexpected have your parents been well yyes the two of them are fine w when i told them that i was going to bucho usrias samas hometown they just expected a souvenir from me f for them to say such a thing after their house was so wonderfully rebuilt they really are selfish parentsahaha i said all that as a joke but hmm a souvenir huh i see buchous fa ther rang a hand bell beside him a butler like person then immediately approached what is your order master yes prepare a castle for hyoudou issei kuns parents a caaaaaaaastle a castle as a souvenir what the heck is that is this some kind of underworld joke yes shall it be western style or japanese style the butler also responded normally is it normal to give a castle as a present what a worrisome choice pplease wait a moment g going that far for a souvenir is a little too m uch i quickly tried to restrain buchous father o our cultures and living levels are too different dear since the land in japan is too small its impossible for a commoner
to have a castle that was the voice of buchous mother thank you very much for your help yes im just a commoner what certainly japan is small hmm if a castle is no good i wonder what else would be a good present father worrying about it that much will just trouble them ises parents dont possess strong worldly desires anyway so said buchou yeah because buchou knew my father and mother well her words were persuasive buchous father also said i see and nodded deeply thank goodness the castle was averted my family wouldnt know what to do with a castle an d it would have surely become a hot topic of conversation among people please dont make my family stand out like that hyoudou issei kun yyes for some reason buchous father kept calling out to me was he very interested in me because i possesse d the power of the sekiryuutei besides that i dont really have any characteristics that make me stand out you may call me father inlaw from today on what unexpected words now that i think of it hadnt sirzechs sama also asked me to call him on iisan was this the
same thing ccall you father10 t thats too great an honour for me i waved both of my hands from the side and show ed my restrained will as expected such an honour was impossible for me dear youre being too fast theres such a thing as order first buchous mother scolded her husband yyeah however its even crimson and red doesnt it make you happy dea r i said that its still too early to celebrate thats true it seems i just tend to be too hasty buchous father let out a deep breath it seemed that he was completely dominated by his wife so the words of buchous mother had a lot of power in thi s household if i watch buchous family closely tonights dinner may be a huge profit for me the person in question buchou was in a state of embarrassment and didnt continue eating hyoudou issei san is it fine if i can call you issei san buchous mother asked this somehow it seems i was the centre of attention at tonights dinner yyes of course naturally i had no particular problem with it so i consented will you be staying here for a
while yes while buchourias sama is here ill be here toobut what about it i see thats perfect since i have to have you acquire gentlemanly behaviour as well youll study manners a little while here huh i have to acquire gentlemanly behaviour what do you mean by that bang the sound of t he table being hit when i looked over buchou had stood up at her seat father mother ive been listening quietly until now but what kind of thing are you trying to advance while leaving me out of it buchous mother narrowed her eyes at those words there was none of the smiling face from when she had pleasantly greeted us before be silent rias you already canceled your engagement with riser remember the fact that we just permitted it should be thought of as special treatment how much effort do you think your father and sirzechs had to put in in order to take care of things with the other high class devils do you know that he told one noble that my selfish daughter canceled her engagement using the legendary dragon you may be the younger s ister of the maou but there is
still a limit my selfish daughter canceled her engagement using the legendary dragon based on the words of buchous mother that party that i barged into was being thought of like thatdid i do something selfish but i d idnt want buchou to be taken away by him and buchou also said that she didnt want to marry riser either but the action i took then was it right no id like to think that it was right onii sama has nothing to buchous face became clouded by anger and she tried to speak out but buchous mother didnt let her you mean sirzechs is unrelated to what you do officially that is true however everyone sees you as the maous younger sister right now when the three great powers have formed an allian ce your position is known even by the lower classes of the other powers you cant behave selfishly as you have in the past and above all else everyone will pay attention to you from now on rias you have been placed into that kind of position you kn ow there will be no second instance of that kind of selfishness do not carry any spoiled
thoughts understood buchou seem to be mortified by those words and couldnt retort back still looking unconvinced she forcefully sat down in her seat after let ting out a single breath buchous mother turned to us with a smile ive shown something ugly to rias group members havent i getting back to the topic you will go through special training during your stay here issei san since you have to experien ce the upper society and nobility even if only a little seriously i have to learn what it means to be a noble then what about kiba and gasper why only me could it possibly have something to do with the discussion my parents had with buchous father the other day like please teach our stupid son about the refined world whether it was because of my parents or not i cant gauge the true intentions of buchous family i pointed at myself and asked uumm why me then buchous mother stopped smi ling and spoke to me frankly with a serious expression you are the last bit of selfishness of my daughter the next family head as parents we bear the responsibility right until the end when i
turned to look at buchou her gaze met with mine and then she turned her face away which had become red its no good i dont understand it all just what kind of situation was i in life2 the gathering of the young devils part 1 in other words for high class devils high society is its the day after i arrived at buchous home in the underworld since morning i had been forced to listen to things about high class devils the upper echelons of society and nobility from a tutor devil yes it was the aforementioned studying this was my exclu sive tutor appointed for me by buchous parents they said he was one of them did that mean that there were others i give up this was just too strange to think that i of all people would be studying about the aristocratic world well since i didnt know a lot about the underworld in the first place it worked out well he also gladly answered my questions since this seemed to be something important i wrote furiously with my pen in my notebook so as to not fall behind hmm was it possible that i also
had homework over the summer holidays now millicas sama was also here in the seat next to me and was studying along with me despite being small he was diligent he seemed quite intelligent the other club members were sightseeing around the gremory s land along with buchou how nice how nice they seemed to be touring around buchous exclusive castle and the castle that sirzechs sama used when he returned to his birthplace they were sightseeing around the gremory castles i wanted to go too youn g master do you know the devil alphabet nno i really dont know it very well then remember them one by one from now on in this way the tutor devil carefully and patiently taught me who didnt even know the basics however what was with the young master since last night i had been addressed that way by the gremorys maids butlers and even this tutor its because i have to teach you everything about the gremory family young master please prepare yourself uumm whats with the you ng master thing now then lets speak about the history of the gremory family next ah he dodged the question again why do i
even have to know the history of buchous family as well as the structure of the nobility is it because im her servant did kiba and the others have to do this kind of studying too ah but then why arent asia and xenovia who are also new devils getting this education too geez i dont understand it at all gacha the door opened and buchous mother came in as i thoug ht she really is beautiful grandmother i see for millicas sama shes the equivalent of his grandmother though no matter how i look at her she looks like buchous older sister issei san millicas how is your studying progressing she came betwe en me and the tutor while giving a gentle smile i tried not to show her my clumsy devil writing but she smiled as she saw the notes i had written down its just as sirzechs and grayfia reported you work hard at everything no matter what it is i can t say that your writing is very good but i can grasp your attitude of trying hard to memorise it buchous mother admitted a maid into the room and served tea rias will be returning
soon since there is a customary function for the gathering of young devils in the maous territory today now that she mentioned it that had been included in the to do schedule while in the underworld the young devils of about buchous age seemed to be assembling in one place they were all devils who had yet to debut i n official rating games id heard that the high class devil heirs from old and noble families were gathered by the leaders to come to know one another as they greet each other buchou and the student council president sona sitri also had to go we servan ts would be accompanying her as well ive been busy ever since coming to the underworld now then what will happen next part 2 immediately after buchou and the others returned from their sightseeing tour of the gremory castles we went by train to the t erritory where maou sama was after passing through several magic circles that appeared in mid air for long distance jumps the train continued onward three hours of being jolted around in the train later we arrived at the urban area both the station an d the homes
were modern there were even vending machines here the design was a little different from the world i lived in but the houses id seen so far looked very cutting edge this is the city of lucifaad within the maous territory its the old ca pital of the underworld where the previous lucifer sama lived so kiba explained so this was the town where the old lucifer sama lived incidentally we were dressed in our summer uniforms it seemed to already be our familys uniform were going to ch ange over to the subway from here since therell be an uproar if we go from the surface kiba said this so theres also a subway here this place really isnt that different from the human world thinking about it humans and devils are closely related it could be said that starting from the contract and the reincarnation of humans into evil pieces as servants there was a relationship of coexistence between them i wonder if this is the way their race lives by taking in other cultures and sublimati ng it into their own kyaaah princess rias samaaaaaaa suddenly i heard a high pitched cheer when i looked a group
of devils on the station platform were looking at buchou and giving her longing gazes ooh was buchou a popular person here buchou i s the maous younger sister whats more shes also beautiful so shes a yearned after target among low and middle class devils you know akeno san explained this seriously so buchou is a super celebrity in the underworld ah she is the maous you nger sister whats more shes the next head of the noble upper class gremory family moreover she was in a word an extremely beautiful young woman you could say that its inevitable that she became popular hiiiiiiiiiiso many devils from behind m y back gasper reacted to the voices of the many devils and panicked the tough day continued for the hikikomori how troublesome lets switch over to the underground train quickly before it becomes an uproar has the private train been prepared bucho u questioned one guy from the pairs of black suited men they seemed to be our bodyguards and many of them had followed us from the gremory castle these people were said to be quite strong naturally a certain amount of strength was necessary for protec ting the
princess and us servants yes please follow me thus we followed behind the bodyguard and moved to the underground subway train rias samaaaaaaaa she was very popular among men too buchou waved her hand at a group of men while giving a str ained smile as i thought my master is amazing after transferring from the subway we were jolted around for another five minutes when we arrived it was at a platform in the basement of the biggest building within the city the meeting place for the ga thering of young devils old families and high class big shots was in this building the bodyguards accompanied us until we reached the elevator and then stood waiting on standby we boarded the elevator from the basement with buchou in the lead it was a spacious elevator everyone ill say it one more time no matter what happens stay in a calm state of mind no matter what is said dont start a fight the people above are our future rivals we mustnt show an unsightly form buchous words had mo re fighting spirit than usual and were very intense that was the tone of voice of someone who is prepared
for battle and doesnt intend to lose to anyone me and asia swallowed and calmed down our feelings alright even though im tense and nervous the re are other pawns here besides me so i cant show an unsightly form after traveling up to the top floor pretty quickly the elevator then stopped at last and the door opened when we took a step outside we found ourselves in a wide hall when we got out from the elevator a person who seemed to be an employee was there and bowed slightly to buchou and us welcome gremory sama please come this way we followed after the employee after we went down a certain passage the figures of several people were in a corner sairaorg buchou seemed to know one of those figures that person also noticed buchou and approached us it was a boy based on his appearance he seemed to be about the same age as us he was a rough yet good looking guy with short blac k hair he had an energetic appearance and had a very good physique with plenty of muscles he looked like a pro wrestler rather was he a devil from a
martial artist family his eyes were strangely purple somehow i felt like his face was similar to bu chous no to sirzechs sama its been a while rias he shook hands with buchou while smiling ooh was he one of the young devils as i thought was he a highclass devil in any case even a low class devil like me could sense the intense surge of mag ic power coming from him the devils that seemed to be part of this persons group turned their gazes towards usthey were all strong looking devils yeah i missed you its good to see that youre doing well there are also people here who havent met you yet this person is sairaorg hes my cousin on my mothers side buchou introduced this devil to us wait cousin ah thats why he somehow seems similar to sirzechs sama im sairaorg bael the next head of the bael family bael bael as in the f amous great king just after the maou even the ignorant me knew that wait doesnt that mean that buchous mother was originally from the bael family the family of the great king the clan of the great king thats
incredible oi the gremory fami ly has both the maou and the great king ignoring the shocked me buchou resumed the conversation with the next head of the bael family so what are you doing in a passage like this ah we came out here because its so idiotic in there idiotic ha ve the other members also arrived then agares and astaroth have already arrived zephyrdor came last immediately after he arrived zephyrdor and agares started arguing this good looking guy sairaorg san had an expression of complete dislike rather what did they start arguing about i felt like asking but dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo the building shook greatly and i heard a huge smashing sound eeh what i heard it from somewhere nearby worried by it buchou without hesitation went to the big door from which the noise had come from geez this is why i advised not meeting before the meeting sighing sairaorg san followed after buchou along with the people who seemed to be his servants what what was it we had no choice but to foll ow behind our master buchou though we were plagued by questions and anxiousness beyond the opened big door was a banquet hall
that was all smashed up the tables chairs and decorations were all destroyed all the devils were split into two camps who gla red at each other at the centre of the room weapons had been taken out and there was an explosive air to the whole situation one side was made of evil looking goblin like devils the other side seemed to be made of relatively ordinary devils however b oth groups gave off an aura that was full of cold killing intent to the point of being frightening scary very scary what a great quantity and quality of aura they have it felt far greater than ours within my field of vision a table still safely rema ined in a corner of the hall and elegant looking servant devils could be seen in the centre of these gentle looking male devilswas a person drinking tea zephyrdor can you not help starting a fight at a place like this do you want to die do you reall y want to die even if i kill you i wont be blamed by the people on top the two groups glared at each other a female devil had said it coolly
saying something fearful like ill kill you ooh but what an incredibly beautiful woman she is was she a bout the same age as me she wore glasses and her cold and sharp gaze was scary as i thought she really is scary the wave of magic power being emitted from her aura was incredibly chilling she wore a blue robe and exposed very little skin that was sli ghtly regrettable hah ill say it again bitch i said that id teach you in one shot in a private room with great trouble the agares onee san really doesnt like being without her guards now does she heh is that why youre still a virgin who hasn t let a man come near her till now geez all the women of families of the maous stink of virgins and are unbearable thats why i said that id do a formal opening ceremony for you uwahwhat a vulgar mouthed onii chan he had a black magic like tattoo on his face and his green hair was standing on its end as expected there were also black magic like tattoos on his upper body which was bare and uncovered the ornaments on
his pants jingled and clanked a delinquent no matter how you look at him hes a delinquent heh so there are delinquents in the other world as well his faceseemed good looking but his features were just too dangerous looking so what happened between these two was the glasses onee chan sexually harassed by the delinquent oni ichan sairaorg san came up to me who didnt understand from behind and explained this place is a waiting hall where we remain on standby until the time comes to explain it better the young people gather here and give each other small greetings howev er this is what happens when the young people greet each other by gathering many hot blooded people together problems like this also come out the old devils of the old families and high class devils cant help assuming that this is a good thing i don t want to have anything to do with such a useless thing but it cant be helped after adjusting his neck with a snap sairaorg san stepped forward to the two teams who were glaring at each other wait wait its dangerous over there you shouldnt appro ach either camp when
theyre in such a dangerous mood i tried to restrain him but buchou stopped me ise watch him watch sairaorg carefully eh y yes but why because hes your cousin he is the number 1 among the young devils seriously n umber 1 as in the strongest sairaorg san came between the two sides who looked like they were about to start brawling the eyes of the glasses onee chan and the delinquent turned to him seegvaira princess of the agares family and zephyrdor rebel c hild of the glasya labolas family if you go any further than this i will be your opponent listen i know this is sudden but this is your last warning depending on your next words and actions i will use my fists without mercy sairaorg sans words ha d such intensity in them what an incredible threat i also felt the tingling pressure of it on my body a vein started throbbing on the forehead of the delinquent devil at those words and turned red with anger for the incompetent bael family to doga an intense blow resounded before the delinquent could finish speaking he was slammed into the wall of the hall by
a blow from sairaorg san gara the delinquent fell off from the wall he seemed to have already lost consciousness and fell face down on the floor in one hit he took out the delinquent who had been releasing so much strong magic power in just one punch i told you that was your last warning in reaction to the actions of the strong sairaorg san you bastard damn the bael family the delinquents servants nearly rush forward from the momentum of losing their master but look after your master thats the first thing you should do even if you turn your swords towards me you will gain nothing the important function will be st arting soon so make sure your master recovers first the delinquents family stopped moving at those words and then ran over to where their master had fallen down next sairaorg san turned to look at the glasses onee chan i could understand why he r expression stiffened then theres still time put your make up on again it wouldnt do to attend the function while wearing something so bad ii understand the glasses onee chan turned back and then left the hall along with her
family after c onfirming that sairaorg spoke to his own family call the staff the hall is too messed up and i wont be able to have tea with rias like this i had been charmed by sairaorgs behaviour and conduct this person is strong and also cooooooool this is the man who is number 1 among the young devils this may have been the first time in my life that i had such a cool guy so close to the same age as me ah hyoudou then i heard a familiar voice from nearby when i turned around people who wore the fam iliar kuoh academy uniform were there so its saji ah kaichou too hello rias hyoudou kun it seemed that saji and sona kaichou had also arrived in the hall part 3 i am seegvaira agares the next head of the agares family rank archduke we of the gremory group were given a greeting by the glasses onee chan from before the ojou sama of the agares family after that incident the reception hall had been restored by the magic of the staff members who ran over and had mostly been returned to normal the young people
had gathered amongst themselves again and were exchanging greetings we were all sitting around a table with the delinquent from before and his servants left out buchou of the gremory family kaichou of the sitri family sairaorg san of the bael family and that delinquent from before seemed to be of the glasya labolas family however this onee chan was the next head of an archduke family the archduke is maou samas agent who passes judgment onto the lives of us devils according t o what ive heard from buchou if the maou sama was the president of a company the great king would be the vice president and the archduke would be an executive director it seems strange for there to be four presidents but thats how devil society is nice to meet you im rias gremory the next head of the gremory family im sona sitri the next head of the sitri family buchou and kaichou continued the greetings the masters had sat down and their servants were on standby behind their masters it was the same everywhere im sairaorg bael im the next head of the bael family rank great king sairaorg san introduced himself majestically as
i thought he really has a majestic air the number 1 among young people really is on a different level a boy with a gentle atmosphere who had gracefully been drinking tea all through the uproar earlier also spoke im diodora astaroth the next head of the astaroth family please take care of me everyone his voice was quite gentle he seemed innocent en ough but he was a devil this person may also be amazing underneath astarothumm if i recall correctly thats the family that the current beelzebub comes from since the delinquent from before was a glasya labolas he should be from the same family as the current asmodeus sama is it okay for the next head of the family to be someone like that i heard from others that with the influence of the overly free spirited maou samas their siblings were all serious and diligent the glasya labolas family see med to have had some family trouble the other day the person who was supposed to be the next head of the family just had an unforeseen accidental death zephyrdor from just before is said to have become the new candidate for the next head so
explained s airaorg san seriously the glasya labolas family is going through something terrible but then i think such a person being the next candidate is also terriblewell it may be better not to poke my nose into the affairs of other families and so six youn g devils were present here in total the servants of these devils also seemed to be strongi seem to look the weakest herei feel awkward there were the gremory that has lucifer the sitri that has leviathan the astaroth that has beelzebub the glasya labolas that has asmodeus and also the great king and archduke as well these were the six families what incredible faces what dream members i see this is the reason why these young devils are so promising certainly these members who will apparently t ake responsibility for the future could be called promising perhaps because they were in the world of the high class they all had a different kind of behaviour and aura so what did the old families and the high class devil leaders want to see by gatheri ng these members here hey issei dont show a stupid face saji said this to me while sighing
but isnt this a meeting of high class devils i cant help being tense they all seem strong what are you saying youre the sekiryuutei right should nt you be a bit more dignified even if you say thatwait why are you getting angry about it saji the servant devils have to behave with dignity in this place since the opponents are watching not only the masters but their subordinates as well s o if you act like that youre being rude to senpai as well be a bit more aware youre the sekiryuutei of the gremory group after all i was a bit astonished at getting such fierce comments from saji its because youre senpais prided servant even i would like to be the pride of kaichou saji gave a bitter smile butwhat is it what had happened to him as i felt like asking a door opened over there and an employee came in sorry for making you all wait for so long everyone is waiting at las t the function was starting the room that we young devils were all led to had a strange atmosphere about it there were seats placed in very high places here
and there were distinguished looking people sitting there whats more there were distinguish edlooking devils on the level above that as well there was a face i recognised on the next level above that maou sirzechs sama beside him was serafall sama she wasnt dressed as a maou shoujo today beside those two werefaces i didnt know but could they be beelzebub sama and asmodeus sama since even i could feel their powerful magic power from here my idea didnt seem to be incorrect however both of their appearances were very young we were in a situation where we were being looked down upon by the higher ups from a position high above us honestly it wasnt a very pleasant feeling because it was like the higher ups were looking at us with condescending eyes i hated this feeling we were standing by in line behind buchou though were not rea lly doing anything in particular even so we were tense because it was so extremely silentsince i couldnt stand it i looked at girls from other families there seemed to be beast girls and former human girls as well itd be best if i could improve my relationship with
them later as i was secretly going full throttle like that the six young people including buchou moved forward by one step the delinquent had also recovered and stepped forward as well the swelling of his cheek didnt seem to have gone away yet and a vivid mark still remained well it was that strong of a punch unless asias healing sacred gear was used on it it wouldnt disappear for a while rather i would never let asia near that guy who knows what he might do good you ha ve gathered in order to check the faces of you all who will carry the burden of the next generation you have been gathered here this is also a meeting that is performed over a regular cycle so that we can ascertain the young devils an elderly male d evil spoke with a solemn voice while clasping his hands together they seem to have fought right away though this time a full moustached male devil spoke out sarcastically he was referring to the matter from before they really had fought right away i was also surprised was this youthful indiscretion you six are all devils of the next generation
that have pedigree and true ability that no objection can be raised against thats why i want you to compete together before your debuts and increase you r power in this way sirzechs sama said this from his seat on the topmost level so in other words theyll be doing rating games with their servant devils here now that you mention it azazel sensei talked about it about them setting rating games durin g our training camp in the underworld could this be what he meant will we also eventually be sent out in the battle against the khaos brigade sairaorg san suddenly asked that straight out what an amazing thing to ask i dont know however i don t want to send out young devils if possible sirzechs sama answered as such sairaorg san raised his eyebrows in seeming incomprehension at that answer why even if were young we carry part of the responsibility of devils if we just receive kindness from our predecessors even at this age and nothing further is done sairaorg i acknowledge your bravery however youre reckless above all id like to avoid sending you all who are still in the midst of growing to
the battlefield besides it would be too great a loss if we lost the devils of the next generation i want you to understand you are all more of a treasure to us than you think thats why i want you to experience important things step by step and grow sairaorg san said i understand to sirzechs samas words and seemed to consent to his words but his expression seemed dissatisfied after that the difficult talk continued about difficult words from the higher ups and about the upcoming games from the maou sama it was all incomprehe nsible to me and my head felt like it would burst so it wouldnt be ending soon wait ill have no time to rest even when it ends as the training will start for the training camp but id like to face the training after ive had a short sleep in bed now then i apologise for keeping you with this long talk well we all see our dreams and hopes in you young ones i want you to understand at least that you are the treasures of the underworld everyone hung on sirzechs samas words i understood that t here were no
lies in the maou samas words as i listened as expected of buchous onii san he was a fundamentally kind person he was a candid and interesting person by nature to finish things will you now let us hear your respective future goals the first to respond to sirzechs samas request was sairaorg san my dream is to become maou he declared that kind of thing suddenly amazing hoh the higher ups also let out breaths of wonder at sairaorgs goal which he had declared upfront without hesitation its unprecedented for a devil from the great king family to leave it a male devil higher up said this when the people of the underworld feel that theres no choice but for me to become maou i will become one he declared even further he really is amazing this person with no time for me to be surprised buchou spoke next my goal for the near future is to live as the next gremory head and to win in each rating game battle i see so thats buchous dream and goal i felt like i was hearing it for the first time how reliable so like buchou alright we servants will
do our best for the sake of buchous dream after that the other young people also stated their dreams their goals until the last one remaining at the end was sona kaichou then sona spoke i wish to build a school for the rating games in the underworld a school heh so kaichou wants to build a school but while i felt admiration for her the higher ups scrunched up their eyebrows if its learning about rating games isnt there already one for that as if checking a higher up asked this to kaichou kaichou answered blandly that is just a school where only high class devils and devils of privileged rank are accepted the school that i want to build is one wh ere low class devils and reincarnated devils can also attend without any distinction ooh so a school without discrimination thats good it would be a good place for the future underworld saji was also proudly listening to kaichous dream however hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha the laughter of the higher ups ruled over the assembly hall i didnt understand the meaning of it the meaning of why the higher ups were laughing when i turned to look at buchou her
eyes had narrowed and her face had become serious eh eh what was going thats impossible this is just brilliant i see so youre a little girl who dreams its good to be young however for the next head of the sitri family to state such a dream i have to say thank goodne ss that it was here at this place of introduction before your debut i dont get it why was kaichou being looked down on even if the current underworld has changed much from the past discrimination between the high class devils low class devils and reincarnated devils still exists there are also still a lot of people who believe that to be natural as well kiba spoke blandly from beside me whats with that but werent we welcomed normally by buchous family isekun the gremorys are a family that has profound affection they dont really discriminate against humans or low class devilsbut please remember the house of phoenix at kibas words i remembered riser phoenix in my mind certainly that guy had looked down on me both because i was low class and a servant he may have showed a discriminatory attitude towards me in the
midst of all this kaichou spoke frankly im serious serafall also nodded strongly in agreement she almost seemed to be saying well said with her positio n as maou she couldnt support her younger sister but even so she seemed worried about her a higher up spoke with cool headed words sona sitri dono low class devils and reincarnated devils merely work for their high class devil masters and are only s elected for their talent wouldnt building such a training institution make the old families who value tradition and pride lose face no matter how much people say that the world of devils has entered a period of change change can be both good and bad something like teaching mere low class devils really is nothing of your concern the one who couldnt remain silent anymore to these words was saji why have you been looking down on kaichous on sona samas dream like that while ive been listening sil ently its strange why should you decide that it wont come true were serious here be careful how you talk young reincarnated devil sona dono your servant hasnt been properly trained one of the higher up devils said this
what are you saying youre much stranger why do you say such a thing even though you told them to say their dreams if buchou was treated in the same way i would also be shouting complaints like saji i apologise ill speak to him later kaichou said this while not changing her expression at all saji didnt seem to be able to understand her reaction kaichou why these people they mocked your our dream why do you remain silent saji be silent this isnt a place where you can display such an attitude i simply told them my future goal thats all kaichou narrowed her eyes and scolded saji saji also seemed to want to say something but he held his tongue in that case if my sona chan wins magnificently in the games you wont have any complaints right since many things are granted by saving up good results in the games everyone was surprised by leviathan samas sudden suggestion the leviathan sama in question was in a surprisingly pissed off mood geez you oji samas are all joining forces t o torment my sona chan even i have my limit of endurance if you bully her that
much ill torment you as well serafall sama spoke to the devil higher ups with watery eyes the higher ups in question blinked their eyes at the livid maou leviathan sama and had trouble reacting kaichou covered her face in seeming embarrassment ooh this really is a situation in which nothing can be said however i also felt a refreshing feeling from serafall samas words i think that no one has the right to look down on ones dream in addition to that the underworld has to change right in that case kaichous dream is a good ambition shouldnt the higher ups acknowledge that kind of dream when you live too long you really do become inflexible there are a lot of parts of the old customs of the old families and noble families that im not familiar with well i do have to remember the customs of the gremory family very well then lets play the games between these young people everyone paid attention to sirz echs samas words seriously were going to play in the games rias sona would you not like to fight each other so its come to that maou sama me and the rest of
the servants were also shocked by this unexpected thing buchou and kaic hou also stared at each other and blinked in surprise without minding them sirzechs sama continued originally it was planned for rias game to take place in a few days azazel has gathered rating game fans from each of the powers also under the pret ext of watching the games of the young people before their debuts thats why its fine like this lets hold the game with rias and sona based on sirzechs sama words the completed training camp prepared for us by azazel sensei was meant to prepare us f or the widely anticipated match among spectators our opponent is kaichou the student council president seriously a sudden showdown between the two devil groups that attend kuoh academy buchou let out a breath and then showed a defiant smile to kai chou ooh she intends to do it kaichou also started to show a scornful smile she also intends to do it full throttle it may not be an official one but it feels like fate to me that you would be my first rating game opponent rias now that were co mpeting with each other
i wont lose sona sparks were flying right away hey hey hey hey it was buchou vs kaichou the occult research club vs the student council a match between rias chan and sona chan yes it may fire things up serafall sama also looked happy the date of the competition is august 20th in human world time you may each divide up your time as you like until then the details will be sent again later by sirzechs samas decision the rat ing game between buchou and kaichou was going to start in this way part 4 i see so itll be a showdown with the sitri group we had returned to the gremory familys main residence the one who had welcomed us there was azazel sensei we had gathered in the wide living room and given sensei an account of the meeting from a short while ago today is july 28th in human world time so we have about 20 days until the showdown day for some reason sensei began to calculate iis it for the training when i asked sensei nodded naturally i plan for you to start from tomorrow onwards ive already considered each of your training
regimens but is it okay for only us to receive advice from the fallen angel governor isnt that foul play i felt that it wouldnt have been strange if there were complaints from the other young people as well however sensei just sighed not really i intend to give data to the various members of the devil side you know also the angel side is said to also be doing a backing up system the rest depends on the pride of the young devils themselves if they think from the bottom of their hearts that they want to get stronger and raise their original duration theyll take the help wholeheartedly ah if you say it like t hat i see its to the extent that even my vice governor is also giving advice to each of the families hahaha shemhazas advice may even be more helpful than mine no way please dont say something that makes me uneasy like that geez this fallen a ngel governor is too cheerful though its thanks to that that its easy to be around him well its fine gather in the garden tomorrow morning ill give each of you your training methods then be
ready yes all the club members responded to sense is words once more alright in any case the game has been decided we have to prepare for it and train and above all else i have to get closer to vali even if only a little as i thought that grayfia san appeared there everyone the hot spring ba th is ready that was the best report the japanese style hot spring existed in an isolated corner of the gremorys garden i immediately immersed myself in it completely along with kiba and azazel sensei ah im healing this is a good hot spring when going on a trip while submerging himself into the hot spring azazel sensei hummed a tune ooh hed also let out his twelve black wings hahahaha as expected when speaking of the underworld of hell its the hot springs moreover when it comes to the distinguished gremory familys private hot spring one of the best in the underworld a great spring is also a great spring surprisingly the governor sama seemed accustomed to hot springs thats right he was wearing a yukata when i met him for the first time could it be that he really
likes japanese culture kiba and me had matching towels on our heads and had submerged ourselves in the hot water since earlier kiba was being incredibly disgusting because he suddenly isekun shall i wash your back what kind of thing are you saying while blushing its like my chastity is being stolen by you well i suppose its a precious thing having some nude socialisation with a male with a friend like him since we didnt get to open up to each o ther at the previous training camp there was a restrained part between us now that i think about it where is gya suke11 even if hes a cros sdressing boy is he really unable to do some nude socialisation ah as expected hes loitering at the entrance rather it was inevitable i rose out of the hot water and headed over to gasper hey hey come on you have to enter since its a hot spr ing i caught gasper at the entrance kyah gasper screamed out in a cute manner kyahyou reallywait dont roll up your towel all the way up to your chestyou arent a girldamn it he looked like a girl he had a
thin body and a girlish face why are you a man when youre like this because i was staring and scrutinising gasper he blushed and spoke uumm please dont look at me like that yyou dont put up your towel all the way to your chest if youre a guy because you always dress li ke a girl its confusing for me as well nno way you were looking at me like that ise senpai i feel like my body is in dangeeeeeeeer shut up i had felt that i could go to the underworld if things were just as is yet i snatched this guy in a princess carry and immediately brought him over to the hot springs splash i threw him in nooooooooo its hoooooot im meltiiiiiiing ise senpai is perverteeeeeeed his screaming echoed throughout the male baths idiot buchou and the others hav e already entered the female baths next to us ise you cant sexually harass gasper you know buchous teasing voice after that i heard the girls small giggling waaaaaaaaah so embarrassing i couldnt take it and plunged into the hot spring even after my head sunk down i rose up immediately uu even though
i just put the hikikomori into the hot spring by the way ise coming next to the watery eyed me sensei had a lewd face yes have you rubbed rias breasts sensei asked that while squeezing the fingers of both of his hands in the air yyes with my right hand i also gestured with my right hand in the air buchous breasts had the best sensation i think its something i wont ever forget in my life i fee l like i could live with just that i see then how about nodding sensei thrust his index finger forward horizontally and spoke have you poked a womans nipple with your finger sensei made sure to press the air with his finger n no not yet seeing my reaction sensei sighed whats with you you havent poked nipples with your finger you poke a nipple not with a press but with a squish burying the finger into the breast is the best part you know what b bbburying the finger in the breast p pressing the nipple like a buttonnot with a press but with a squish in the case of huge breasts im certainly interested in burying my finger
deep within them but nnipples arent front door buzzers thats right buchous breasts arent buzzers rather the instant when buchous breasts emerge my love towards buchou is wholehearted however sensei shook his head at my words and grinned no it is close to a buzzer when you push it it rings hyaaan i imagined a b uchou buzzer letting out an hyaaan inside my mind what is thist there was such a world out there breasts and nipples have such a functioni thought breasts were only for rubbing sucking and holding between them i see so it can be poked and made to make noise when i thought about it i had never thought of poking nipples like that why didnt i ever realise this wisdom while i was absorbed in my rubbing and my sucking impulse i definitely forgot about poking im so foolish sensei patted my head thats why you still have some way to go a womans breasts are infinite handled correctly they are packed full of infinite possibilities more than the ouroboros ophis you know because i was fascinated with them i plunged into the breasts of wo men and fell i dont regret it as
i thought this person is amazing you understand too governor while tears flowed down my cheeks i spoke to sensei with a trembling voice sensei i want to poke breasts sensei gave me words of encouragement whil e gently patting my head yeah dont give up ise if its you you can do it if you give up that will be the end of breasts right yes yes thats right by not giving up everything can also advance forward by not giving up buchous breasts can also be poked and ill make buchou cry out buchou will cry out to my poke while i was like this the voices of the girls reached my ears ara rias did your bust get bigger again you like being groped by me dont you rreally ummyour way of t ouching is a little indecent rather didnt your bra cup change more than mine akeno my old one was still fine even though it was a bit tighthowever recently ive been thinking that it wouldnt be bad to show it off in a bigger way a woman becomes bolder when she has a partner shed like to show it to rias tthats true however

mixed bathing ise buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh i was seized by a floating sensation and my field of vision moved dizzinglyyyyyyyyyy owaaaaaaaaaah i was blown off into the aaaaaaaaaaaair my field of vision moved from the mens bath to the bath next door and my eyes met buchous while in the air and so then doppo oooooooon oww i hit the surface of the hot spring water hard and floundered in the water splash when i jumped out from the hot water paradise on earth was there before me buchou akeno san asia xenovia koneko chan everyone was naked buh a nos ebleed gushed out naturally when suddenly being transported from a place of just stupid men to a world of only women its only natural for the world to change the mixed bathing that i had always dreamed about my tears wouldnt stoooooop normally in this kind of situation things like buckets would be flying with screams of kyaah pervert and i would be torn apart but buchou akeno asia and xenovia didnt even try to hide their naked bodies c cover yourselves everyone youre girls after a ll ara ise were you thrown over by azazel was your body properly washed
ufufu oh ise kun youre so daring rather buchou and akeno san were coming closer while smiling wryly their big white breasts were swaying up and down right in front of me hurray for breasts i was at my wits end and transfixed by the breasts that were approaching me akeno san caught me an instant before buchou did isekun i caught you squish she embraced me from the front and akeno sans body became glued to my body let alone her breasts everything all of akenos soft body was on meeeeeeeeee aakeno san i iiiif you cling to me like that my brain was affected by both the heat of the hot springs and the erotic heat and my head was on the verge of boiling aaah damn it akenos body really is incredible why does her body feel so good both its springiness and elasticity are amazing was this increas ed smooth feeling the effect of the hot spring squish although i had been satisfied with akeno sans whole body i was once again hit by some first rate softness buchous face popped out over my shoulder b buchou this time it was buchou clinging to m e
from behiiiiiiiiiiind the sensation of buchous breasts hit me from behind aah the tips of those things were stimulating my back i think buchous nipples were more effective at soothing than a poor massage machine akeno get away from my ise buchou wrapped her arms around my neck and tried to snatch me away from akeno san however akeno san was firmly clinging to me from my front no way ive decided to enjoy the hot springs with ise kun im already heating up our bodies by clinging like this ise kuns body feels good just by touching it like this akeno san clung to me even more firmly uwaaaaaah akeno sans breasts are being pressed so much that its like theyll fuse with my body amaziiiiiiiing this deadly softness i also wanted to emb race akeno sans body against my better judgment but if i did that buchou will get angry at her servants betrayal and kill me stop it ises body is mine who do you think trained and raised this child its the fruits of my labor that made the sens ation of embracing him like this the best from this childs hair to his entire body
everything is mine aah somehow im feeling sensitive is this because of what akeno san did just beforeor is it because im touching ise buchous embrace also bec ame stronger uwaaaaah onee samas breasts were being perfectly transmitted even from my back the volume was like an extra large all youcaneat buffet moreover i could even hear her rough breathing buchous sexy voice was destroying my brain i mean i was raised by buchou so the finishing condition on this body of mine was also for the sake of being used as buchous hugging pillow im happy please give me more sexual training and nurturing aakeno sans breasts were touching my chest and b buchous breasts were touching my back i was caught between buchous breasts and akeno sans breasts from the front and baaaaaaaack amaziiiiiiiiiiing i was caught between breeeeeeeeeeeeasts this is the legendary breast sandwich a paradise exists in the unexplored regions of the underworld a voice like that from a survival program rushed through my mind with such stimulus from the breasts sandwich i in a pleasant dream space couldnt help but discharge a stream of nosebleed sensei had talked about it if its now when im
caught between them i can poke if i poke like with a frontdoor buzzer buchou may let out an hyaaan amazing the female body is amazing my finger was being buried in the nipple what on earth was happening was my finger being eaten up by buchous breasts auu even though i want to enjoy the hot springs with ise san too as i thought itll be an almost impossible task to snatch ise away from those two i have no choice but to watch from afar for today asia and xeno via were talking about something from a little further away butthe impact of the breast sandwich was too strong hah suddenly i came to my senses based on this situation koneko chan would be muttering disgusting pervert senpai and would blow me away somewhere with an especially large punch i timidly turned my gaze to look at koneko chan but koneko chan had half submerged her face in the hot springs while wearing a gloomy looking expression and was blowing bubbles in the waterhuh is koneko chan still not feeling good but at that moment my consciousness began to recede yeah i understand with the blood streaming down
from my nose i was losing myself in the heat from both the hot springs and the breast sandwich nuhahhoh i got th e sensation that my soul was escaping from my mouth even getting too happy makes my soul fall out isekun ise akeno san and buchou were making a panicked commotion but i was happy just happy matsuda motohama there is definitely paradise in he ll is this what it means for a buddha to be in hell next time ill tell you of the wonderfulness of the breast sandwich and so in this way i lost consciousness part 5 the next day we all gathered in a corner of the gremory familys huge garden everyone was dressed in jerseys azazel sensei was also wearing one after everyone had sat down at the table and in the seats that had been placed in the garden the meeting before the start of our training began right away last nights hot spring bath was the best ill never forget it the rush of blood to my head had been serious but i couldnt stop grinning since morning coming to the underworld really was a good idea i truly thought so
that feeling wouldnt change or go away sensei had what seemed to be documents and data let me say this first what im going to tell you now is a training regimen that focuses on things in the immediate future there are people who produce good results immediately but there are also those who have no choice but t o look at things in the long run however you are all growing young people even if you mistake your direction you will grow well now then first is rias you buchou was the first one that sensei called out to from the beginning you have been a hig hspec devil with everything including talent physical ability and magic power even if you live normally as you currently are those traits will rise and youll become a candidate for being a highest grade devil when you become an adult however your w ish is to become stronger than you would in that future right buchou nodded strongly at senseis question yes i dont want to lose ever again it was just as buchou said we didnt want to lose in the games again especially in a match that isnt formal then
follow the training recorded on this sheet exactly even all the way up to the battle day after looking at the piece of paper that sensei handed to her buchou tilted her head in puzzlement but this training doesnt seem all that special though thats right its a basic training method thats just fine for you youve already collected everything thats why your power can only be raised by basic practice the problem is the quality of the king over time the king seeks brains more than strength you know that even if theyre not good at magic devils can climb to the top with a good head and cleverness right learn all you can about the rating games until the deadline drive everything from game documented images to documente d data into your head what a king needs are the thought quick wit and judgment to defeat any kind of situation its your job to make sure that your groups servant devils can display their power to the fullest however also remember that until the actual game you wont be able to know what will happen its the same as a battlefield ooh we made fun of the basics
but sensei actually put a lot of thought into it as i thought because of his persuasiveness i feel that buchou and the rest of us have no choice but to practice first next akeno yes although she was addressed by sensei akeno san was sullen akeno san doesnt seem to like azazel sensei at all she had also said that she hated him a little as i thought was it related to he r father as i thought that sensei spoke of that topic right from the front you must accept the blood that flows within you perhaps because of being told that so bluntly akeno san also frowned but sensei continued without paying it any attentio n ive seen the recorded images of the battle with the phoenix family what was that with your original specs you should have been able to easily defeat the enemy queen why didnt you use your fallen angel powers you limited yourself to only thunde r if you dont add light onto thunder and make lightning you cant display your true power i see akeno san has the blood of a fallen angel too therefore she can also use the power of
light that is quite effective against devil opponents moreover if she adds that onto her specialty of thunder her power would become incomparable i can do just fine even if i dont depend on that kind of power however akeno sans situation was extremely complex dont deny yourself what will you do if you c ant accept yourself in the end the only thing you can rely on is your own body right denying yourself makes you weak accept everything about yourself even the tough and painful things your weakness is your current self overcome it by the day of th e battle if not you will become a mere obstruction in future battles the priestess of thunder must become the priestess of lightning akeno san didnt respond to senseis words however akeno san also understood that she had no choice but to do it i believe i believe that akeno san shall break through this wall next is kiba yes first you must maintain balance breaker for a full day if you get used to it youll be able to maintain it for a full day in your actual battle form your objective is to continue that and to
become able to maintain that state for the length of a day after that youll be able to become sufficiently strong by doing basic training like rias ill teach you man toman how to handle sword type sacred gears lat er so you ask a sacred gear expert about sacred gears sensei was talking about himself as an enthusiast but what was so interesting about sacred gears for sword trainingwill you train under your teacher again yes i plan to be taught from scratch again heh so this guy had a sword teacher as i thought is he strong because hes so diligent kiba will really let himself be taught from scratch so is this guy going to become stronger again next xenovia to be able to use durandal better than you do nowyou need to be able to use another holy sword another holy sword xenovia looked doubtful towards senseis words yeah a slightly special sword sensei grinned but he soon stopped smiling and turned to look at gasper next is gasper yyeeeeeeees this hikikomori kun was a bit nervoushe came to this place after a long time of social withdrawal after all there were a lot of people
coming and going dont be so frightened your biggest obstacle is that fear you need to train your m ind and body that fears everything from scratch from the start the specs with your bloodline and your sacred gear are substantial skill improvement of your bishop special characteristics and your magic will also support you greatly since ive construct ed an exclusive hikikomori escape plan program you must first put on a proper attitude as much as possible even if going out in public entirely is impossible for you make sure that your movements arent dull so said sensei exactly this guy cant d o anything if he doesnt become strong in mind and body first the ring that stabilises sacred gears doesnt seem to be good for the body if used too often so its been removed except for special times for the time being he also didnt seem to be runnin g out of control i was still worried though yeeeeeeeeeeeees ill try to obtain a spirit that goes for broke please dont say something that makes me feel uneasy like that gasper when you say that it seems like youll really go for broke ah loo k
youre immediately trying to go back into your cardboard box the same bishop class asia yyes asia was also showing fighting spirit as well she had confessed before that she felt that she was usually not very useful to everyone that wasnt t rue asias recovery ability was outstanding if asia wasnt here there would have been a lot of dangerous situations i think that she should have confidence in herself you will also improve your body and magic with basic training also your main task will be to strengthen your sacred gear isnt asias recovery sacred gear already the best she can heal everything besides sickness and stamina just by touching that was my opinion could her recovery ability be improved any further her recovery spe ed was already considerable she could heal even a fatal injury i understand that the speed of her recovery ability is great however the problem is the touching part she cant heal if she doesnt expressly go into close range if an ally is injured ah somehow i might have understood what azazel sensei said could asias sacred gear expand its range buchous words were exactly what i wanted to ask sensei affirmed
it thats correct rias this is like an underhanded trick but to show the tru e worth of twilight healing its effective range must be expanded so its also possible for asias sacred gear to be used in long range as well sensei nodded at my question isnt that an incredible thing according to the theory based on the data gathered by our organisation it should also be possible for the sacred gear aura to be issued from the whole body and to use the recovery on all allies within ones surroundings seriously if thats really true asias role on the battlefield will bec ome something unthinkable the labor of healing people one by one can be eliminated and the time reduced as well many chances for a counterattack would be born however just how big is the database of the fallen angels does it really have data on all po wers concerning sacred gears but the problem is that it would seem to heal both enemies and allies without discernment it would be fine if it could distinguish between enemies and allies and heal only allies butim worried about asias own nature asiaswhat are you worried about sensei answered
my question with a serious look shes a kind person when seeing an injured enemy on the battlefield asia would think in her heart of wanting to heal him too that would obstruct the sacred gears ab ility to distinguish between enemies and allies most likely asia wouldnt be able to obtain this distinguishing power this enlarged healing range that i spoke of just now can be a double edged sword for this team even so you should keep the range expa nsion in mind so if used poorly asias range expansion will also heal the enemy to think that the cause of that would be asias kindnessthe sacred gear system is too ironic thats why ive found another possibility the power to fire the healing au ra sso you mean i would send my healing power to someone that is some distance away from me asia made the gesture of throwing something i was healed just by that cute gesture yes it seems that you can directly throw it when ise is battling 10 me ters away and is injured you would fire your healing power at ise if what you have used until now is a standard limited
field the one im explaining now is a projectile version you could heal even if you arent directly touching the healing power as a projectile hey hey hey thats unthinkable tthats amazing asia can play a great active role like that i took asias hands and held them up spiritedly though asia was surprised at this unexpected information she was also in a happy state its power would be a little less than with direct touch but being able to heal allies from far away is still a strategic characteristic with many uses with one or two people jumping into the front lines and arranging for the healing asia and someone to guar d her in the back youd be able to make the ideal formation so sensei even went as far as to imagine the formation he really does like thinking to such a large degree huh buchou agreed with senseis opinion its an easy method but thats why stro ng tactical formations are simple usually the method used to heal allies is phoenix tears or some mixed healing medicine asias sacred gear could easily top those with its all purpose characteristic and reliability thats right the power of
asias s acred gear which can also heal devils could be called this teams distinctive characteristic and weapon after that is merely a test of asias strength please finish the basic training properly okay yyes ill do my best do your best asia if it comes to it ill act as asias shield after all ill absolutely protect her i cant let asia who is like a cute younger sister to me have her beautiful looking skin damaged next is koneko yes koneko chan was in considerable fighting spirit i wonder what that was about even though she had seemed unwell here until recently she was strangely excited today what was koneko chan thinking about you have nothing to be criticised about as you possess the elementary traits of offence and defence as a rook your physical ability is also not a problem however there are those better at offence in rias group than a rook like you i know that koneko chan wore a frustrated looking face in response to senseis clearly spoken words could it be koneko chan was that what you were worrying about no but isnt koneko chan already stronger than the plain me and better
than kiba or akeno san in terms of pure strength the ones at the top of offence in rias group are currently kiba and xenovi a its because they possess brutal weapons with his balance breaker holy demonic swords and her holy sword durandal and with ise who plans to enter balance breaker here offence certainly kiba and xenovias power in this were excellent though i don t know whether ill be able to succeed in attaining balance breaker koneko you will also improve your basics like the others in addition release the thing that you have personally sealed its the same as with akeno if you dont accept yourself big growth wont be possible for you koneko chan said nothing in response to senseis words her fighting spirit from before had suddenly disappeared at the mention of releasing what was koneko chans power what problem did she have dont worry if its koneko chan you can become strong in a flash i spoke casually and tried to pat koneko chans head but my hand was brushed away please dont say that so lightly a stern expression this was my first time seeing such a stern feeling from k oneko
chan did i step on a land mine what should i do the encouragement i tried to give had the opposite effect while the atmosphere became somewhat gloomy sensei worriedly looked at his watch now then the last is ise for youplease wait a moment should be here soon sensei looked up at the sky huh what was i supposed to be waiting for rather what was coming i and the others also looked up at the sky what was it there was nothing there as i was feeling doubtful a huge shadow appeared in the sky within my vision it was heading towards us at extreme speed uwah huge a monster demon ghost it couldnt be an enemy attack could it doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon the earth shook as it landed right in front of us even sitt ing down in a chair the ground shook greatly and i fell to the ground a cloud of dust danced in the air and after it settled a huge monster appeared before us it was fifteen meters tall a monster its a monster a mouth that split hugely brutal looking fangs that had all grown out from its mouth thick arms and thick legs
two wings spread out on its sides i knew what this was i had seen it several times and there was also one lodged inside me a dragon thats right ise this is a dragon sensei nodded so it really is a dragon its huuuuuuuuuge a monster when it blew out it would let out fire its definite that all the surrounding vicinity would be burned azazel you have some nerve openly entering devil territory the enormous dra gon raised the edge of its mouth and spoke ooh it talks hah ive properly gotten the personal permission of the maou sama and have entered this territory fairly you know do you have a complaint tannin sensei seemed to know this dragon hmph wel l its fine i specially came here because of sirzechs request dont forget your surroundings fallen angel governor heheh anyway ise this guy is your teacher sensei said that to me as he pointed his finger at the enormous dragon by no means my teacher eh eeeh eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh this huge dragon is i was so shocked that my eyes popped out naturally they did seriously this monster is my teacher shouldnt my teacher be you azazel sensei
what do you mea n its been a while ddraig can you hear me the monster dragon spoke to me or rather he was addressing the one inside me then my left arm shone red on its own and my boosted gear appeared ah how nostalgic tannin reacting to the jewel ddrai g spoke out so that people nearby besides me could hear him is he an acquaintance of yours when i asked i got a yes in response this guy is a former dragon king i told you about the five great dragon kings before right tannin here was a drago n king back when they were the six great dragon kings the dragon called tannin recorded in the bible is him hah a dragon king certainly there are also dragon kings aiming at me scary scary a huge dragon like this is aiming at me no no i absol utely do not want to meet them just vali is enough for me as a dragon opponent wont i die before i become a harem king tannin became a devil so the six great dragon kings became the five great dragon kings even among the current reincarnated de vils
he is ultimate class a highest grade devil so said azazel sensei then this dragon is a devil reincarnated from a dragon heh so a devil reincarnated from a dragon and whats more a dragon king also entered the industry to be called a highe stgrade devil he must be even greater than buchou seeing him before me i actually felt it even a reincarnated devil can aim for the top blaze meteor dragon tannin its even said that his breath of fire is equal to the impact of a meteorite hes one of the few legendary dragons that are still active right now sorry tannin but please help with the training of this kid who carries the red dragon emperor i want you to teach him how to use a dragons power from scratch azazel earnestly asked tan nin this wait so im going to learn how to use my power from this dragon that possesses meteor level power is that okay wont i die even if i dont do it it should be fine if ddraig teaches him directly right even so there is a limit to it he really needs true dragon training the original actual combat
form i see so youre saying that you want me to torment this boy tannin continued after senseis words like that hey hey im going to be tormented if im tormented by such a monster ill immediately die this is my first time training someone who harbours ddraig the dragon said that happily while narrowing his eyes with a smile i im going to be killed if im trained by such a monster theres no way ill be able to endure it fundamentally im a human at my base its impossible impossible please control yourself tannin my host is weaker than you imagine ooh ddraig as expected of my partner its fine as long as he doesnt die right leave it to me im going to di e im going to be killed he doesnt seem to understand this dragon ossan12 beside me sensei was nodding in agreement for some reason pleas e dont agree its impossible the period is about 20 days in human world time id like for him to reach balance breaker by then ise work as hard as you can without dying after leaving me those words sensei waved his hand and started to leave eeee
eeeeeeeeeeh youre finished with just that now then each of us will now do our respective training regimens i hope you all do well buchou left me behind and continued the conversation yes everyone also responded and started to disperse from th is place huh huh im training with this dragon just like that no one else thinks that theres a problem here no matter how you look at it im going to be attacked by this dragon you know ill die you know ise do your best buchou gave me a thumbs up and sent me a cheer thats right buchou is the kind of person who doesnt allow compromise when it comes to training usually shes lenient and kind to me but whenever this sort of training starts she gives me demonic and gruelling traini ng miss rias can you lend me the mountain there ill be bringing him over there the dragon ossan pointed to the far off mountain from before sure please teach him well leave it to me ill train him right to the edge of death huh this was t he conclusion of negotiations seriously so that far off mountain will be my grave
the dragon grabbed me with his hand and started to fly uwaaaaah hes flying ive been captured by a dragon ill be eaten buchoooooooooooooooooooooou even as i c ried and begged for help buchou just waved her hand with a smiling face from below me dear grandfather in heaven for some reason i have been captured by a dragon and am flying in the sky the summer of my second year the page of my important springti me of youth i was enjoying it on a mountain with a dragon this place really is hell the heaven where my grandfather is feels quite far away part 6 the summer vacation that i longed for me matsuda and motohama had promised at the beginning of the yea r that we would find girls and have an ero ero summer vacation this year butfor some reason i was instead being shot at by a monster on a mountain in hell dogooooooooooooon nearby trees went flying rocks crumbled and a crater was created in the grou nd uwaaaaaaaaaah i desperately avoided the breath of fire from the monster the dragon ossan tears still came out of my eyes even though i thought that
they had dried out you know because i was facing such a scary feeling every single day my tears co uldnt dry out no enough already this kind of life where is there a high school student that gets shot at by a dragon every day come on sekiryuutei kid if you dont dodge quicker youll become charcoal no i dont want to become charcoal before i have sex with buchou i have to do it with the virgin buchou my plan was to throw away my virginity by having sex with buchou i also wanted to have sex with akeno san i wanted the virgin akeno san too i also wanted to make children with xenovia and i also wanted to get along with asia more why am i on this mountain while on the verge of death several days had passed since i came to this mountain and i was completely worn out my fatigue was at its peak in both mind and body because i was being chased around every day and night by a monster you know even every once in a while when i launched a counterattack i could never turn the tables even if
i punched the scales of such a tough dragon not only did it do no damage it conversely hurt my f ist instead even using my transfer power was insignificant so i could only spent my time running away and hiding every single day that guy was mercilessly trying to kill me moreover that fire breath attackit had blown off a section of the mountain wi th a single breath if i get hit directly by that kind of attack ill die from a single hit since my power has risen my left arm has essentially become a dragon arm since i gave it as payment to the sacred gear in the battle with riser but thanks to p utting a ring i got from sensei on my wrist my arm wouldnt transform sensei really makes lots of things but the time we are in hell is limited when we return to the human world my finger will be sucked by buchou and akeno san again however even jus t running has given me considerable training at present i hadnt even received a single hit from that breathbut my jersey was in tatters it was full of holes once the
grueling training during the first part of everyday ended basic training began it was mainly muscle training when that was done i was always in immense pain as my entire body screamed but it felt better than being chased around by the dragon ossan and i could surprisingly perform it normally i had no choice but to secure my own mea ls rather as i was ignorant of the animals and plants of the underworld i caught fish in the river only after confirming whether it was edible or not from the dragon ossan and i gathered nuts from trees that grew on the mountain i got fire by creating it somehow with my unskillful magic fufufu ive only improved my fire making magic you know huh why was i a living such a life when i caught a fish i unconsciously said tottado13 this is bad arent i steadily becoming a wild child ive been spending everyday here doing this and that i wanted to meet with buchou i wanted to talk to asia i wanted to have tea from akeno san uu the re werent any girls here its a true hell for me i longed for buchous
lap pillow i wanted to savour the feeling of buchous thighs again delusions were the only pleasures that came to me here when ossans harsh training ended i went to the world of delusions buchou and asia were there and they welcomed me warmly recently i even became able to enter delusions while being chased around by the dragon ossan even i thought that i was ill doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh another fire ball was shot uwaaaaaaaah the rock i was hiding behind was destroyed and i was found by ossan here you are here you are its no use even if you become good at just running away come on fight back its impossible youre too strong could you be eve n stronger than vali well i have often been said to be maou class in terms of pure power see youre a monster whats with the maou class talk why am i trying to survive on a mountain with a maou class dragon damn it if its like this i shoul d have gone to the sea with matsuda and motohama i want women even though i had only beautiful girls and beautiful women around me there wasnt a single flag
being raised14 aah it was the best when buchou and akeno san became those girls i had confessed once with the resolution of a dying man but they seemed to say sorry at that instant even i was surprised at myself that my horny nature wouldnt stop having delusions while i was being chased by ossan but i wouldnt be able to survive in these conditions if i didnt have delusions oh youre doing it how is it going i heard a voice that was familiar looking behind me the fallen an gel governor was there so good so goooooooooood while crying i was eating rice balls made by buchou that azazel sensei had brought so good it was buchous flavour it had buchous love in it since i also had a boxed lunch made by asia it was the best theres also a boxed lunch made by akeno eat that too since she made it while causing a show of sparks with rias but hahahaha youve gotten a bit of a good face in the several days that i havent seen you sensei said that while patting my sh oulder dont joke around i almost died i really almost
died this dragon ossan is insanely strong even if you told him to teach me the battle of a dragon when he uses too much of his real power its just absuuuuuuuuuurd i cried out while rice flew from my mouth because its harsh a modern day kid like me cant endure it coming to an empty mountain for several days with a maou class dragon worst of all buchous breasts werent here tannin ossan doesnt know how to hold back im going to be k illed i dont want to die while still a virgin you idiot youve decided not to die right if i was so inclined you would become charcoal by my breath of fire if you dont want to have these painful feelings then reach balance breaker quickly ossan said that to me with half opened eyes while resting on a rock face even if you say that if someone with a human base like me takes a punch from someone monster sized like you ill be turned into itty bitty pieces with one blow hmph how foolish when you call yourself miss rias strongest pawn in that kind of condition do you know how many
devils would want to be miss rias servant now that you mention it buchou is a celebrity in the underworld even when she just briefly appeared in that c ity station before high pitched cheers had risen out for her now that i thought about it there were many devils who wished to become buchous servants does that make me lucky yeah i really am the luckiest because i can live with such a beautiful and kind onee sama with big breasts ah buchou the person i yearned for id like to marry her one daywell its a distant and empty dream i sighed azazel sensei spoke while looking at the training diary that i kept even so youve also been including basic training right then its fine if you dont do this much your body wont be able to keep up when you attain balance breaker there is too much that you are lacking in you wouldnt be able to win against vali with m agic even if he was doing a headstand therefore you have no choice but to raise yourself up through physical strength i understood that it was exactly as sensei said vali is a descendant
of the old maou in terms of magic i absolutely can not win bu t even so how could i win with physical strength there was a big of gap between me and vali in terms of basic specs umm back then vali was trying to do something but what was it i asked azazel sensei this before vali left he tried to do somethi ng though albion also tried to restrain him from doing it ah that was the juggernaut drive is it something above even the balance breaker no there exists nothing above balance breaker the ultimate and final form of sacred gears is the balance breaker however there are several things inside sacred gear that have a magical being sealed in them a peculiar restraint is applied on those ones your boosted gear and valis divine dividing are examples of that i see mine and his sacred gears are the type whose power comes from having a magical being in other words a dragon sealed inside it those ones are strongly restrained taking out power while in that state and making sure that the host can use it in the case of the sacred gears of the
sekiryuutei and the hakuryuukou forcing that restraint to temporarily release and unleashing the sealed power is the juggernaut drive it temporarily gives one power rivalling that of god but the risk is also huge it greatly shaves off ones lifespan and it also makes one lose their sense of reason you mean you lose control yeah to a violent degree one would destroy all of their surroundings and even start to destroy oneself before finally stopping its impossible to master that power in act ual combat butvali can handle it for several minutes by consuming an enormous amount of magic power he should be able to do so anyway since albion was impatient back then i guess that it still has its dangers naturally its not my place to say this as one who uses an artificial sacred gear in a burst state but the way to use a power that throws away ones future like that is essentially different from the way to use the sacred gears power its an accursed method of fighting that just uses the pow er of people that are transformed into the dead you should absolutely never copy it there was sorrow in senseis
eyes was he worried about vali he had talked about teaching him how to use his power when he was still his subordinate so the current ha kuryuukou can handle the juggernaut drive thats a problem the sekiryuutei kid would be killed if he didnt become desperate the way either the white or red awakened that power before certainly let them surpass the other in some sense its first com e first served tannin ossan said such a shocking thing seriously then its my turn to die no i cant die yet i still have a dream to fulfill my harem my high class devil promotion if its like this ill even aim at being an ultimate class d evil like ossan its huge that ive found out that its possible even for a reincarnated devil but can i endure ossans harsh training ossan is too strong i cant win hes a monster that breath of fire is foul play since im not some huge and spec ial hero who can shoot beams from my hands such an opponent is impossible for me ise lets change the topic sensei called out to me who hadnt looked at him since before
with a suddenly formal tone yes how do you think of akeno thats sudden what was this about i think that shes a good senpai i immediately spoke my honest feelings her s mode is a bit scary but shes usually very gentle and the girlish part of her that she sometimes shows is really cute thats not what i meant i mea n as a woman shes attractive shes one of the people that i want to be with sensei nodded at my question with a uh huh while seeming somehow relieved i see you see i also have to watch over her in the place of a friend of mine you mean aken osans father whos one of your subordinates right rather than a subordinate baraqiel is a comrade from ancient times like shemhaza a friend a friend we did a lot of stupid things together so before i realised it everyone around me besides mys elf had gotten wives and kids sensei sighed deeply ah this person is he the type to worry about being single you were beaten to the punch huh its fine since i have so many women for me ah he got a
faraway look in his eyes for an instant th ere is the subject of marriage taboo for him as i thought well leaving that aside im very concerned about akeno though to baraqiel and akeno it may be none of my business sensei youre an unexpectedly heated or perhaps i should say meddlesome person you also involved yourself in our training im just an ordinary fallen angel with free time though it was because of that that i also raised the hakuryuukou thats not true i think that hes just a nosy person with me with akeno and w ith vali he has poked his nose into each of our business what a strange fallen angel with him as the governor i cant understand the whole aspects of his organisation in any case im thinking of perhaps entrusting akeno to you entrusting herto m e what do you mean entrusting do you mean protecting her with my body during games and battles in that case protecting her is no problem for me i think its also the role of the pawn to protect the queen akeno san with ones body youre an idi ot but youre not a bad guy
rather it would be better to call you a loveable idiot above all you dont seem to have discrimination towards her i dont seem to get what youre talking about hahahaha thats why im relieved if you were really deceiving her things would have already descended into carnage if you do it poorly it will have an effect on things from now on and youll also see blood the type like you that takes form from winning the trust of those around you can feel at ease without resenting anyone in some sense thats a privilege or rather a talent my brain was full of question marks i didnt understand it very well but i understand ill protect akeno san of course ill also help my master buchou and p rotect asia too alright well ill entrust the matter of akeno to you more importantly the problem is koneko whats wrong with koneko chan sensei let out a breath at my question theres nothing that can be done about it shes impatient or rather she feels doubt in her power i suddenly remembered how koneko chan didnt seem to be feeling well recently was something the matter with her she
overdid the training that i gave her this morning she collapsed ccollapseeeeeeeeed i was sh ocked at this bad news about my kouhai seriously was koneko chan all right asia can treat injuries but she cant do anything about physical strength overworking in particular certainly hurts ones physical strength and has adverse effects because t he time left until the game is limited thats dangerous uumm if overworking is no good what about me arent i close to death by being chased around by a dragon monster every day i asked this while pointing at myself no matter how you think abo ut it its inhumane ah its fine for you something of this extent isnt enough for that you said so readily is that so how is it fine for me it was just too much to handle and my tears wouldnt stop now then we should go ise i was told to take you back just this once youll return to the gremory annex only once tannin hell be going back for a little while ill return him tomorrow morning yeah then ill return to my territory for now so said sensei and tannin ossan eh i can
tem porarily come down from the mountain heh sensei from whom did the order for me to return come from buchou from her mother buchous motherwhat business does she have with me part 7 yes turn there thats no good the sharpness isnt good com e on issei san do it from the beginning without acting stupefied i was in the annex that was detached from the gremory main residence i was making an effort in dancing practice with buchous mother in a room there why was i doing this kind of thing as soon as i returned to the annex i was led here by buchous mother then we started dancing practice just like that because i had never done something like this before i was completely no good at it buchous mother was wearing a dress as usual i w as having a dance lesson while being glued to buchous mother i sometimes came into contact with her breasts they were wonderfully soft how to say it it had a matured feeling in elasticity and texture i dont understand it that well but thats how it felt and her appearance was the same as buchous was this the
charm of a married woman however this mother shes seriously pretty because she looked about the same age as me i was conscious of her moreover she had the same face as buchou who i ye arned for you know she was a flaxen haired version of buchou f furthermore her style was also exceptional just like buchou her breasts were big buchous breasts were hereditary thank you very much mother your breasts genes were safely handed down to buchou shall we take a short break and so having been given permission i sat down right where i was with long drawn out breaths ah i had been chased around by a dragon since this morning my stamina waswell this is still far better than havin g fire shot at me by that monster ossan but still i asked a question to buchous mother uumm what is it why am i the only one doing this and not kiba or gasper yes why only me including the customary gremory education as well if it was to train me as a gentleman even kiba and gasper should bethough i understood that i was the least like a gentleman buchous mother answered
me kiba yuuto san has already mastered these sorts of techniques as expected of a knight gasper san is a mem ber of a distinguished vampire family he may behave unreliably but he at least knows etiquette the problem is issei san it cant be helped that youre a commoner from the human world but even so its troubling if you dont acquire etiquette beyond a c ertain level because youll also have to make an appearance with rias in high society eventually you have to remember customary practices even a little during your stay in the underworld i was dumbfounded by the words of buchous mother me in high soc iety but didnt i hear that servants couldnt show their faces to such an extent bbuchourias sama and me will be in high society together as i was surprised buchous mother shifted her gaze to the side and covered her mouth with her hand oops i carelessly let something slip out that kind of thing is still talk of what may happen leaving that aside calling her buchou like that will not do this isnt school so you have to properly call your master by her name not to
mention rias isoops i nearly let something slip again eh calling her buchou is no good even if you suddenly say such a thing since ive always kept calling her buchouhmm how about riassama then yes like that or you can call her master though you have to c all her differently in private as well so buchou is no good think if you had to give an answer on that within yourself do you hate that girl buchous mother said that while giving a wry smile no no theres no way i could hate buchou well it would be difficult for you to call her that all of a sudden and rias would also be bewildered if you did that suddenly for this home visit only you may call her buchou however you have to be certain of what to call her eventually now that she b rings it up what was the person in question buchou doing right now she might be in dire distress with poor physical health like koneko chan hmm im also a bit worried id like to go see how she is at least once as her important kouhai butif i go that may
seem like an overuse of my feelings with that uumm can i ask you one question what is it what about koneko chan is koneko chan okay yes it was just ordinary overworking so she should recover slowly if she rests her body for one or two days im very worried about koneko chan since shes been acting strangely since before we came here that girl is doing her best to face her own existence and power right now its a difficult problem however she wont be able to advance forw ard if she doesnt find the answer herself her existence and power i was full of questions what was in koneko chan now that i think of it you havent been part of rias group for long yes its natural that you dont know ill tell you a littl e buchous mother sat down while facing me and began to tell a certain story it was a story of two cat sisters the cat sisters were always together when they played when they ate when they slept with their parents dead they had no home to return to and no one to rely on the two cats struggled to
live day to day while depending on each other one day the two of them were picked up by a certain devil the older sister became a part of his group and so the younger sister was also able to live wit h them having finally obtained a decent life the two of them believed that they could pass time very happily however something unusual happened it appeared that the elder cat sister achieved rapid growth after gaining power buchous mother said that her hidden talent suddenly began to overflow by becoming a reincarnated devil that cat was of a species that naturally excels in youjutsu15 furthermore she bloomed in magic talent as well and even invoked senjutsu that was said only the last of the sennin16 could use it seemed th at the elder cat sister having surpassed her master in a short time was swallowed by power and was transformed into a wicked existence that only sought blood and battle with her increase in power not stopping the elder cat sister killed the devil that was her master in the end and degenerated into an exiled devil moreover she changed into one of the most dangerous among the
exiled devils one that completely annihilated all the pursuit squads it was said that the devils temporarily canceled al l pursuit of the elder cat sister the younger cat sister remained behind the devils questioned her as a liability there this cat may also eventually run out of control its better to deal with her now so they said it was sirzechs who saved that cat that was planned to be disposed of sirzechs persuaded the high class devils that the younger cat sister was innocent as a result the situation was settled by having sirzechs watch over her however having been betrayed by her elder sister that s he believed in and tortured by the other devils the little cat sisters spirit appeared to be on the brink of collapsewhat a sad story sirzechs left the younger cat sister that had lost her smile and the will to live in the care of rias after the youn ger cat sister met rias she recovered her emotions little by little and then rias gave that cat a name koneko i was at a loss for words after hearing this much so the story just now was koneko chans wait then
koneko chans true form is she was originally a youkai17 you know of the nekomata18 right cat youkai she is a survivor of the strongest species among the cat youkai a nekoshou19 they are a high level youkai species who can not only master youjutsu but senjutsu as well part 8 ah buchou ise having moved to the main residence after the completion of my dancing practice i was welcomed by buchou owaaah i was hugged all of a sudden buchou was tightly hugging me ah its been a while since ive had this feelingthough only a few days have passed i missed buchous smell ises smell ah umm ive been sweating a lot its fine your smell is still the same i was lonely you know when you say that with such moist eyes my heart cant help but skip a beat i havent been able to sleep with you since arriving here and i wasnt able to feel you like this every day eithersince i can no longer imagine a life without youwhat a pitiful master i am aaaaah buchou has your level of dependence on me risen im more blessed than i deserve as your servant i
also cant imagine a life without buchou either thats why the training on that mountain was so so tough i tried to say that but however a little endurance is needed first we have to both be strong ise do your best in your mountain seclusion with tannin blow away his breath of fire uuu y yeeeeees ill do my best not to become cindeeeeers as i thought buchou doesn t compromise when it comes to training i replied with tears in my eyes i understaaaaaaaaaaaaand if buchou says so ill do my best with the resolve to diiiiiiiiiiiie but leaving that aside i shook my head again and asked buchou a question uumm b uchou hows koneko chan buchous face became complicated at that follow me the room that i entered according to buchou was koneko chans room buchou had finished talking with her already and akeno san was already inside so only i was told to enter so i went to meet koneko chan by myself her room was wide it was a wide room when i turned my feet towards the bedroom akeno san was standing by the bed and koneko chan was lying down on that
bed i was surprised to see what had sprung up on k oneko chans head cat ears so she really was a cat youkai known as a nekomata but what to do a koneko chan who has cat ears so lovely so incredibly adorable since she usually hides them did she also lose the strength needed to hide them when she r an out of physical strength no no it isnt the time for that now ive come to see koneko chans condition isekun this is because of my reaction to koneko chans cat ears akeno san tried to explain the reason no ive already heard the general story i responded with this to akeno san just like that i move to the side of the bed and examined koneko chans condition i didnt catch sight of any especially bad injuries well if it was just injuries it would be no problem with asia here so sh e really did come here because she exhausted all her physical strength hey is your body okay i asked that with a smile then koneko chan muttered with half opened eyes what did you come here for a sullen tone of voice far
more than the extent u p until now she was angry that i came huh would it be no good if i said it was because i was worried still acting sullen koneko chan didnt respond i continued koneko chan i heard about it about all the various things in any case overwo rking yourself is no good if you dont take care of your bodythough i have no right to talk while im receiving hellish training i want to koneko chan muttered something very quietly and since i failed to hear it clearly i asked again eh what is it then koneko chan looked straight at me and spoke in a clear tone while holding tears in her eyes i want to become strong like yuuto senpai xenovia senpai akeno sanand also ise senpai i want to make my spirit and body strong gy akun is also becoming strong i dont have a healing power like asia senpai eitherat this rate ill become useless even though im a rook im theweakesti hate being useless koneko chan so you were worrying about thatcertainly kiba has also become stronger xenovia is strong too akeno san is the strongest piece queen and
gasper can stop time asia may be no good at fighting but her healing ability was great and then there was me even though i myself was weak i hold a legendary dragon in my body koneko chan continued to talk even as she shed large tears but i dont want to use the power sleeping inside memy nekomata powerif i use it ijust like my neesamai dont want thati absolutely dont want such a thing for the first t ime for the first time i saw koneko chans crying face like this since she was a kid that hadnt directly shown much of her feelings up until now seeing that was a shock to me koneko chans onee san had her power run out of control and killed her de vil master and then she had just left like that buchous mother had said that this girl had seen all of that because she knew that a dangerous power that could just kill her master was sleeping inside her too she was afraidbut even so when thinking o f the situations in the coming future she wanted power this girl had carried these conflicting feelings even when coming to
the underworld so she overworked herself because she tried to become stronger without using the power sleeping inside her koneko chan possessed a warm heart with strong feelings for her friends so she was vexed that she herself was useless i think it was hard for her not being able to repay buchou who saved her i was also mortified at my lack of ability and uselessness to bucho u and wished for power as well akeno san shook her head and spoke to me isekun please leave the rest to us but youre a kind person but its also important to sometimes keep your distance just a little besides you yourself have to become st ronger and i alsosince im the same as koneko chan we have to overcome this together if one cant accept all of oneself and cant understand it one cant move forward koneko chan and i understand this in our heads butour courage is just slightly no t enough yet please wait just a little longer koneko chan and i will definitely get through this definitely akeno san also displayed hatred towards the fallen angel blood sleeping inside her but if she didnt accept that
power of light she may not be able to play an active role in the tough games from beyond this point i see the two of them are similar in that regard denying the power that sleeps inside them because those two have done that yes akeno san koneko chan illtry to do the thing s only i can do i bowed my head to the two of them and then went out of the room just like that we each have our respective battles we each have our respective forms of training we each have our respective walls that we must surpass alright im fi red up akeno san koneko chan everyone and buchou ill also surpass the training that only i can do after i slept soundly that day i returned to the mountain the following morning life3 cat and dragon part 1 oryaaaaaaah explosion the increa sed power from my sacred gear flowed into my body and my physical power rose instantly try dodging this tannin ossan opened his mouth wide goooooooon dooooooooon i nimbly avoided the fire balls that he fired continuously and put my hand out forwar d i imagined a huge magic bullet and
firing it dragon shot don i shot a huge magic cluster from my left hand it was about half the size of ossan it should be even more powerful than the one that blew up a mountain before thanks to that my magic po wer was almost empty with what i shot out plus the increase my weak point was that i could only store a small amount of magic power the limit to how much i could raise the power was also only this much hmph so youve sent out something a little decent ossan intended to take the magic bullet right in front of him without dodging doooooooooooooooh ossan caught it in front of him with his thick arms and then vigorously fired a breath from his mouth doh goooooooooooooooh my magic bullet was sent far off into the sky over there by ossans single breath reset my increased power was reset and i was immediately seized with fatigue ossan looked at both of his hands small sizzling fumes were rising from them did my magic bullet burn ossans hands nice shot compared to when i first met you your dragon power has definitely risen your physical strength
is also nothing to criticise youve also gotten to the point where you can continuously play with me for a whole day as well unusually ossan prai sed me i was breathing heavily and was gulping down from the water canteen i always keep prepared on my back this water canteen as well as being for hydration was also able to slightly offset and weaken ossans fire breaths by increasing the power of t he water through the power of my sacred gear well i had also thought of various coping methods for it my appearance was also ragged my jersey was no longer functional with only my important parts protected and my upper body was completely worn out an d nude yeah my chest had also become thick and my unnecessary fat had also disappeared i had found plants and animals on the mountain and had cooked and eaten them i had acquired quite a lot of survival abilities i couldnt believe that i had lived like a mountain monkey during my summer vacation thanks to surviving in the wild like this i had acquired fire magic and by combining it with my sacred gears ability i could do
the fire technique directly taught to me by ossan a huge fire power ill show it to you sometime and so many days had passed since i made that vow in koneko chans room the battle with the sitri family is on august 25th today was august 20th five days remaining timewise we were in the period where we were finishing thin gs up the time to gather together was also near it was planned for there to be a day for us to gather together again and also get some rest for the sake of recovering on that day from the fatigue gathered during our training afterwards it seemed that there would also be a party sponsored by maou sama before the game and our family as well as the other young devils also seemed to be invited in other words there was no time left for any more training you did well up till now as well but its unfor tunate it might have been possible if you had just one more day your training ends tomorrow butits probably impossible tannin ossan sighed yeah i understand i wasnt able to reach it during this period of time i
had progressed when it came to ph ysical strength or anything else but i was going to finish my training without having reached balance breaker i couldnt complete the target of my training part 2 then ill be going now im also attending the maou sponsored party lets meet again there hyoudou issei and ddraig were currently in front of the gremory main residence i had returned by riding on the back of tannin ossan no the back of a monster dragon was actually comfortable and overwhelming it was only a short trip through th e air but it was the best yes thank you ossan see you at the party sorry for troubling you tannin well meet again yeah i also had fun since i got to work together with that ddraig ive lived a long life thats right do you want to enter the party by riding on my back really is that okay yeah its no problem ill take my group and come here on the day of the party ill contact the gremorys later for more information really ossan truly is a sensible dragon then ill come he re again tomorrow farewell after saying just that
ossan flapped his wings and disappeared off into the sky i saw him off while waving my hand what an easy going dragon king i think hes a good person when we first met he was scary buthes coo l for a dragon me and you are also dragons you know thats true buti think that a genuine dragon is really large and magnificent me and you were just a possessed devil that was originally human and a part of a sacred gear well thats true right as i thought thats the dragon hey ise kun when i turned around towards the familiar male voice kiba was there he was dressed in his jersey but it was all tattered so i wasnt the only one his good looking face also looked quite tightened now youve gotten a good body kiba said that while looking at my naked upper body i covered myself sstop it whats with those eyesdont look at my body with those eyes somehow i felt danger to my body because he was scary sometimes this g uy hhow cruel i just wanted to say that you built up your muscles nicely youhavent changed well because i have
the body type that has difficulty in putting on flesh im jealous oh ise and kiba this time it was a girls voice it was xe novia wait she had bandages all over with her whole body covered in bandages xenovias appearance was also ragged but y you whats with that appearance when i timidly asked that xenovia looked over her appearance again and spoke yeah i beca me like this because i trained got injured and bandaged myself and then trained got injured and bandaged myself again youre like a real mummy woman how rude i have no intention of being preserved forever you know thats not what i meant geez shes incomprehensible as usual but i felt that the aura around her body was quieter and thicker than before speaking of which kibas aura was also denser huh my ability to see the flow of magic power had also improved from before was this also a result of training with ossan did my sense become sharper from becoming one with the nature of the underworld isesan kiba san and xenovia san too coming out from the castle gate was asia in her nun clothes ah it really is
asia asia its been a while iisesan p please get dressed asia panicked at seeing my nudity she seemed to mean that because she was embarrassed at my conduct rather than embarrassed at my nudity i should put something on whats with this girl she was used to seei ng me naked ara it seems everyone from the group that went out has returned the next to appear was buchou its been so looooooooooong my buchou my onee sama shes still just as beautiful as always buchoooooooou i wanted to see you iseyouve become very robust havent you your chest is thicker she embraced me tightly while saying that ah the feeling of buchourather because my lust itself was suppressed during that mountain seclusion the level of my arousal was intense from smelling t he scent of the woman i missed so muchas i thought women are nice now then everyone please come in once youve taken a shower and changed clothes well meet to report the outcomes of our individual training it seemed i was once more living the ci vilised life i missed so much however to report that i hadnt attained balance breaker it was truly shameful
part 3 this was actually the first time in over two weeks that we of the rias gremory group had all gathered together like this after we had go tten our training plans from azazel sensei i had been taken away by a dragon but it seemed everyone else had split up after that as well thats why this was our first gathering since then to be honest this may have been the first time that we had all lived separately from the rest of the group for so long rather i think its the first time since i had joined it as a member since i didnt know about anything before i was here after the ones who had trained outside me kiba and xenovia had taken showers and changed our clothes we all gathered in my room why my room i had inexhaustible doubts about it but it seemed that the reason was that it was easiest for them to gather here it seemed there was a problem with going into buchous room was t here something there that she couldnt show us so we had gathered and talked about the contents of our training kiba gave a
detailed account of his training with his master xenovia also recounted the contents of her training i spoke about my life of survival with tannin too everyone else had it easy kiba and xenovia had also trained outside but they seemed to have trained while living at a mountain cottage and a villa belonging to the gremorys respectively and a life style of hunting animals and pl ants in the mountain and avoiding the fire breath of a dragon for me seemed to be unimaginable to them huh huuuuuuuh thats strange whats with this could it be that i was the only one that had a hard time i slept outside you know with no blankets nor pillows i had to sleep there while lying on huge leaves that grew in the underworld umm sensei wasnt i the only one living a cruel lifestyle i was also just as surprised that you could survive on the mountain i thought that you would run ho me midway that you would begin to live normally on that mountain was also completely outside my expectations eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh whats with that i i hunted judged baked and ate rabbit looking animals and w ild boar
looking animals native to the underworld you know i kept water in a water canteen after boiling and sterilising it once on an iron pan i found on the mountain thats why i was surprised youre too sturdy in some ways you have surpassed de vils how cruel i lived while being chased around everywhere day after day by a dragon on that mountaaaaaain do you know how many times i was close to death ueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh i cried at it all because because becaaaaaaaaaause i wanted i so w anted to see buchou i wrapped myself in leaves and slept while remembering buchous warmth every niiiiiiiiight it was so hard the dragon ossan wouldnt go easy on me and also attacked while i was sleeping he blew off rooooooocks i was assailed by fore st fiiiiiiiiire i ran awaaaaaaaaay if i didnt run away i would have diiiiiiiiiiiiied poor iseyou endured a lot didnt you yes ise you became so sturdythat mountain doesnt have a name but ill name it mt ise from now on buchou pulled my head to her chest and hugged me the feeling of buchous breasts healed my tough past having endured so much shock i
also hugged buchou back and cried enormously so cruel azazel sensei is cruel he let me be kidnapped by a dragon i still remember buch ou waving her hand below me it was a kidnapping even thinking about it now it was a kidnapping no even so your physical strength seems to have improved considerably with this the time when you can wear the armour in balance breaker has just about arrived but you werent able to attain balance breaker right azazel sensei didnt seem particularly disappointed that i hadnt attained it well the possibility of you not attaining it was also within the range of my predictions yeah you didnt receive any shock ise i mean its impossible to attain balance breaker when there are no dramatic changes i thought that something would be changed in you through the survival lifestyle and by coming into contact with a dragon king class dragon but the time wasnt enough if it was at least for one more month impossible if i had lived another month of that kind of lifestyle i would die of buchou deficiency disease if i couldnt feel buchous warmth like this periodically id die i buried my
face in buchous breasts and shook my head in refusal no no i cant take going to that mountain again buchou also gently caressed my head ueeeh buchoooooou well its fine the report meeting ends here tomorrow is the party youre all dismissed for to day the report meeting ended with senseis voice thus my survival lifestyle came to an end that night it was bedtime but somehow asia and xenovia were staying in my room it had been arranged so that me asia and xenovia shared the same bed unable to calm down with both asia and xenovia on the wide bed as well i slipped into my bed asia was already sound asleep perhaps because the bed we shared was wide xenovia was laying a little ways away from me moreover for some reason she seemed to be u nable to sleep as she just stared at the ceiling now that i think of it maybe she couldnt sleep until late because this was the first night that we shared the same room whats with you you still cant sleep yeah when i think of it im not used to sleeping with a man yet even if there
isnt a sexual meaning to itim tense hey hey hey seriously youre tense after saying those kinds of things well its not like i dont understand tthats true even i was excited and couldnt sleep the first time i slept together with buchou and asia having boys and girls of the same age sleep in the same room does that you know ii see so this is natural huh but asia is amazing she seems to be sleeping so peacefully its because asiais al ways sleeping with me and buchou at home she was embarrassed at the beginning but now shes used to it having asia lying down next to me gives me great peace of mind ise san please dont leave memunya asia murmured in her sleep fufufu i under stand the reason why ise and buchou think that asia is cute xenovia said that while giving a wry smile right asias cuteness is the best and then before i knew it my consciousness also slipped awayand i gave myself into the night part 4 it was the evening of the next day and i was wearing the summer uniform of kuoh academy while waiting in the parlour because
today was the night of the party after all i had slept for a full half day today thanks to that i felt like i had greatly recovered from all my built up fatigue it had been a long time since i had last worn this uniform thats because until recently i had only worn my jersey it really did fit quite nicely just in case i also wore an armband that had the gremory pattern inscribed on it with this it seems like i was okay for the party the girls had been taken away by all the maids saying that it would take some time for them to get ready hmm kiba and gasper had also gone off somewhere for some kind of business hyoudou when i tu rned to look towards the familiar voice saji was there why was saji here saji why are you here ah kaichou will be going to the meeting place along with rias senpai and i followed her here so kaichou went to meet with senpai and after that i inev itably ended up wandering aimlessly around the mansion until i arrived here this main residence really is wide inside as well
after all so he arrived here after losing his way saji took a seat a little bit away from me and spoke while wearing a serio us expression the game will be taking place very soon now yeah i trained me too i was chased around by a dragon on a mountain every day iis that so youve had a hard lifestyle as usual well i also did an extremely hard menu i see he a lso put forth great effort in his training naturally it will affect our masters victory or defeat i also had a strong fighting spirit saji spoke while scratching his cheek hyoudou do you remember the time when the young devils gathered a month ago yeah what about it we were serious thenm myd dream is to become a teacher all of a sudden saji said that with a red face teacher what will you teach even though he was flushed red saji answered my question sincerely kaichou is trying t o establish a rating game specialty school in the underworld it isnt an ordinary school its an open school for anyone and that accepts devils regardless of whether they are high class or low
class aristocrat or commoner i heard from kaichou that thin gs like discrimination and traditions have been softened in the devil industry little by little but there is still a part at the root of it all that refuses to accept these changes thats why the current rating game school only accepts high class devils from aristocratic families the games have to be equal for everyone this is what the present maou samas have decided though its equal the path of the games is far for low class devil commoners thats strange right though even a non aristocratic dev il may be promoted to a high level devil depending on the method the possibility shouldnt be zero along with being surprised i also admired the serious opinions of saji this guy looks seriously towards the future in his own way huh kaichou has tol d me that she wants to do something about that that she wants to teach so that even lowclass devils can participate in the games thats why shell make a school that anyone can enter in the underworld kaichou is even studying in the human world as well for the sake of that to give a
chance to the ones who never got into the spotlight even if its just by 1 even if its almost zero as long as its not zero one might be able to become a high class devil hyoudou even we believe in that possibility and try to become high class devils right yes thats exactly it thats right i had set my sights on becoming a high class devil even if the possibility is zero i have the fighting spirit to make it 100 saji made a declaration while raising his fist tthats why i will work as a teacher there ill study a lot fight in a lot of games and store up various things ill become a teacher who teaches about pawns with that kaichou also said that she wants to help me even someone like me may be able to become a school teacheri ive only done stupid things in the past ive also caused trouble for my parents and was disliked by the people around me but if its kaichou i can see a dream i will stay by kaichous side and help her for life kai chous dream is my dream saji spoke while feeling
embarrassed hehehe i kept the fact that i became a devil secret from my mother but even so she cried when i told her about my future dream you become a teacher she may have said that because it d oesnt suit me but it wasnt bad the relieved face of my mother so that was sajis dream its a different path from me since were the same pawns i had thought we might be the same but people really are respectively different after all he has h is own dream i wanted to become independent of my master in the future and had set my own goal he intends to serve his master his whole life even if we became devils at the same time the paths we aim for are truly different i felt that there was somet hing a little miraculous about such a simple thing i think thats a wonderful goal saji become a good teacher yeah its also for the sake of that goal that we have to beat you guys this time ah i see then its no good since were the ones wh o are going to win no its us since we
acted so stupidly before we have to prove ourselves with our results though we laughed at the same time his eyes were serious he wont back down however a teacher huh i suddenly remembered azazel sensei but well this guy would never be like that as expected by the way saji what is it i poked the air with my finger it seems a womans nipple is like a buzzer when poked w whats with that oh saji was listening with apparent interest as expected he really is a lewd person just like me i heard about it from azazel sensei that the possibilities of breasts are infinite it might not be good to go on to the next world with not only lacking the experience of rubbing them but also of doing other things like poking them but to poke hey hyoudou what about me when will i be able to rub my masters breasts he discussed that seriously wwho knows even i have never rubbed them after one piles up luck upon luck one can rub them saji drew near me with eyes of anger whats with that luck none of it has been coming to me you
know no i said too much usually im only at the extent where we sleep together and go into the bath together i only said that much but it was no good saji gave an expression which showed the shock he received in the depths of his heart he unsteadily moved away from me and feebly sat down in a chair with a gakun he was in a terrible state his eyes were opened wide and his whole body was trembli ng sleeping bath whats with that i ihave never done those things with kaichou ssaji hey i called out to him but there was no reaction he just kept murmuring those quiet words ise sorry for making you wait ara so saji kun came when i looked behind me there was a dressed up buchou there and all the other club members too amaziiiiiiiiiiing everyone had put on makeup and was wearing dresses their hair was also done up they all looked like princesses akeno san was wearing a we stern dress today too uwaaaaaaah this was baaaaaaaad she was just too lovely she was a beauty that surpassed excellence asia was also embarrassed but her dress really suited
her xenovia also appeared to be unfamiliar with wearing such things but s he was sufficiently taught in being an ojou sama koneko chan wore a dress that was a size smaller but she had a cuteness that would inevitably have her kidnapped by a lolicon the problem was gasper why are you also wearing a dress gasper was also d ressed up in a dress it was so suitable that i could say nothing i thought he had disappeared because he had some business to take care of but it was for this instead bbut i wanted to wear a dress too this guy is sohis crossdressing habit is so c onsiderable even to this point saji saji whats wrong the likewise dressed up sona kaichou was dubious looking at sajis state so youre shocked to that extent saji when the dressing up was finished there was the massive s ound of something flying in the garden along with a soft tremor in the ground soon a butler came and spoke to us tannin sama and his family have arrived ossan had come to greet us just as promised when we went out to the garden the best part
was th ere along with tannin ossan there were 10 dragons about the same size as ossan so huuuuuuuuuuuge amazing all the members of ossans group are dragons i came just as promised hyoudou issei yeah thanks ossan while you all ride on my back il l place a special barrier around you with that your hair and clothes wont get messed up by the wind since those things are important to women this dragon is so considerate as expected of an ultimate class devil thank you tannin well be relying on you until we get to the meeting place the people of sitri are also here is that okay ooh miss rias youre especially beautiful tonight please leave that matter to me thus we got on the dragons back and flew off into the sky of the underworld i got to ride on top of tannin ossans head a special seat i held onto the edge and surveyed the sky uwahhah as i thought the scenery seen from the back of a dragon is a superb view since coming to the underworld i havent gotten tired of these fa ntasy experiences but i could do without the part of
being chased around by a dragon for me to see this scenery from on top of a dragon its an experience that cant be described ddraig gave a rare bitter smile ddraig originally had the body of a d ragon too after all hahahaha that is an interesting experience ddraig however there are only three mighty dragons that are still active left including myself no since i was reborn as a devil the only real ones remaining are ophis and tiamat the rest have either been sealed or have retired yulong and midgardsormr never come out onto the surface anymore and ddraig albion fafnir and vritra have been sealed into sacred gears in all ages strong dragons have been suppressed strong dragons are a fearful existence after all ossan said that in just a slightly lonely tone now that you mention it why did dragon ossan become a devil ossan seriously responded to my question one reason is that in this era where there arent any big battles anymore i thought that i would get to fight various guys if i participated in the rating games and theres another reason another reason do you know of a fruit called the
dragon apple its an apple that dragons eat no its my first time heari ng of it rather its a very blunt and obvious name there is a certain race of dragons that can only live by eating that dragon apple however the ones that grew in the human world have become extinct because of sudden environmental changes now that fruit only grows in the underworld but dragons are hated in the underworld theyre detested by both devils and fallen angels theres no way they would give it away for nothing right thats why i became a devil and so the territory that grows the f ruit was all made my territory when you exceed a high class devil you can receive a part of the underworld from the maou i had my eyes on that place then do those dragons that have food trouble live in ossans territory yeah thanks to that they avoided becoming extinct and i also performed research on how to artificially grow the dragon apple in my territory successfully its a special fruit so the research takes time still if it lets there be a future for that race its better to continue amazing so
he went that far for the sake of helping that race i thought he truly deserved the title of dragon king ossan really is a nice dragon ossan laughed loudly at my words a nice dragon gahahahahahahahaha thats the first time ive been told such a thing moreover im greatly obliged to receive praise from the sekiryuutei however boy the desire for the continuation of ones race is the same among all living beings its the same for humans devils and dragons i only thought of savi ng my fellow dragons as well that is what a dragon who has power does for dragons without any power amazing i just blindly wanted to become a high class devil a and i try dashing forward just because i want to form a harem is this kind of mental a ttitude no good that kind of thing is fine while youre young if youre male its inevitable that you come to want women and wealth it isnt good to overdo it but its fine if that becomes the driving force that moves you however hyoudou issei it s so wasteful to just make a harem your final goal if you become strong
its natural for females to approach you the problem is after getting both women and wealthit may still be too difficult for someone young like you to understand yeah it may be a bit difficult for me however because of the various devils ive met since coming here ive come to think just a little everyone lives while having a goal wanting to win in the tournament wanting to become maou wanting to save dragons wanting to become a teacher theyre all devils yet what they aim for is completely different for me its to become a harem king that still hasnt changed but it may be no good to not move towards that realistically and away from my ordinary delusions various things are needed to become the harem king i aim to be in that way after i thought about these things with my slow brain while chatting about this and that for a short hour bright lights began to spread out below me it seemed like we had finally arriv ed at the meeting place part 5 the high class high rise hotel that was being used as the meeting place for the party was located in a
wide clearing within a huge area of forest that was on the edge of gremory territory the scale wasnt incomplete at all i could see the entirety of the grounds from tannin ossans head but the scope of it was so great that the town i lived in could completely fit inside of it the dragon we were riding on alighted down to a place that was like the grounds used for a sport s match when ossan came to the skies above these match grounds lights were simultaneously concentrated on him from below making him look like something out of a monster movie then well be going to the waiting space exclusively for large devils thank you tannin ossan thanks buchou and i gave our thanks to tannin ossan ossan and the other dragons then flapped their wings again and moved towards another area of the party grounds then we were led by the hotel employees who had come to pick u s up at the sports groundsand we got into an expensive looking limousine hahaha it was truly an astonishing way of continuing on after coming this far the dress wearing buchou and asia sat down next to
me everybody from the sitri family sat in the ba ck of the limousine buchou gave an explanation while fixing my collar there are also facilities located around the hotel and the army is also standing by here it is much stricter here than in the lower urban areas you know buchou then took a comb o ut from an expensive looking bag and combed my hair it seems my hair had become disheveled because i rode on tannin ossans head instead of on his back though i didnt feel any truly strong wind thanks to the barrier he mentioned buchou what about aza zelsensei it seems that he will head here after joining up with onii sama and the others on another route since theyre really close friends after all hahahaso they hit it off well with each other as mutual powerful leaders i was smiling but jus t then buchou got a serious look ise you couldnt hear because you were on tannins head but just before i declared war on sona saying that we will beat you for the sake of our dream so such a thing happened on ossans back i was too absorbed i n
looking at the scenery from the air then a school a rating game school for the sake of building that sona studied the school system of the human world while living as a student there the schools of the human world which anyone can enter are impo rtant for sona after all saji said the same thing that kaichou was attending kuoh academy for the sake of her dream buchou saji also said it that he would become a teacher his eyes were shining as he said it but its a serious goal to him even so we will win we have our own dreams and goals as well buchous determination was firm she wouldnt go easy on her opponent even if it was a friend in that case i will also strike against the opponent in front of me right saji im going to c ome straight at you while i was thinking this the limousine arrived at the hotel when we came out we were welcomed by many employees we entered inside like that and once akeno san confirmed us at the front desk we went into the elevator it seems t he party is on the huge
top floor ise if youre called out to by any people from distinguished families make sure to greet them properly okay yyes but buchou tonights partywas prepared by maou sama for the young devils right that is the of ficial stance in truth people wont get very excited even once we enter the room this is an annual custom if anything its more like a gathering for the members of all the distinguished families to meet we the next family heads are just extras whi le its really a party for our fathers to enjoy themselves in reality theyve made reservations at the nearby facilities until the fourth or fifth after parties proof of that is that they arrived at the meeting place separately from us they probably ga thered together before the young people arrived and may have already finished their alcohol buchou grumbled with a displeased face next to us akeno san and kiba were also giving bitter smiles haah buchou seems fed up with this kind of partyor rather with the actions of her father and the others in other words although it was sponsored b y the maou since it seemed to be a casual kind
of party thats still different from a high society party her father and the others looked forward to it very much as it was one of the few times they could cut loose the elevator arrived and when we step ped out the entrance to the meeting place also opened we were led into a gorgeous hall on this incredibly large floor there was a crowd of devils and various delicious looking foods to eat the ceiling had as expected a huge chandelier i couldnt stop looking at that chandelier here and now ooh everyone noticed buchous entrance and breaths of admiration were let out princess rias youve become more and more beautiful sirzechs sama must also be proud everyone was looking at buchou buchou had said that they wouldnt be excited but they were plenty excited right now i was also somewhat happy and above all i was proud im the man that has rubbed this persons breasts fufufu my face broke into a grin just now what is this strange feeli ng of superiority it could be called a pleasant feeling of only me knowing the secret of the woman that everyone longs for uuu theres so many
people the dressed up gasper was tightly sticking to my back you againarent you wearing a dress for the sake of being seen in it how can you enter here with that hikikomori spirit of yours as usual his cross dressing hobby is still difficult to understand ah but hes improved a little hasnt he even though he was exposed to the curious gazes of so m any people here he didnt try to run away so hes also trained for this too thats great gasper ill give you some candy afterwards ise were making our rounds of greetings heh i had an idiotic face but even so it seemed the fact that the le gendary dragon had become a devil was famous and there were many high class devils who wanted to greet me for that reason i ended up being led around by buchou as we circulated the floor i was surprised by how the gentlemanly behaviour that buchous mot her had taught me was more effective than i had expected i see now that ive become a part of buchous group it was an indispensable skill buchous mother thank you very much thanks to you i wasnt
embarrassing myself ah im so tired having fi nished my greetings i was freed but me asia and gasper sat down on chairs prepared in a corner of the floor buchou and akeno san were a distance away conversing with some female devils kiba was surrounded by all the female devils damn it die good looking guy though even if i say that since this really was my first time at such a party me and asia and the others were all mentally fatigued and completely exhausted in a corner occasionally there were male devils that greeted the cute asia as i t hought asias cuteness is well understood even in the world of devils because shes so extremely cute ise asia gasper ive gotten some food eat up xenovia who had gotten up from her seat a little while ago was skilfully holding a massive quanti ty of dishes on top of the dishes were various extravagant foods sorry about this xenovia no its nothing this amount is inexpensive look its better for asia to have a drink too thank you very much xenovia sansince its my first time doing this kind of thing i was nervous and my
throat got dry asia accepted the glass of juice from xenovia and started drinking it i started on the dish id been givenit came complete with chopsticks well since there were reincarnated devils besides us i n here they must have been prepared for every way to pick up ones food and then there was a silhouette in front of me it was a girl wearing a dress she was staring at me really hard who was she huh i feel like ive seen her somewhere before ah youre iits been a while sekiryuutei the sister of that yakitori bastard yes it was the sister of rias former fianc riser phoenix how nostalgic its been several months since then right its ravel phoenix geez this is why low class de vils are so slow and disagreeable she was really angry as i thought she was angry because of the drama from the cancellation of the engagement huh sorry so is your brother doing well when i spoke about her brother ravel sighed thanks to you hes been in low spirits it seems that his defeat and having rias sama stolen away by you was a great shock well since he
had always relied on his talent and got cocky because of it it should have been a good lesson for him arara how harsh so she severely cuts at her brother too what a sharp tongue hahahahayoure pretty merciless you were also part of your brothers group right about that ive currently finished trading and ive now become my mothers servant my mother traded away an u nused piece she had in exchange for me since my mother said that she would trade me again when i found someone whose family i want to become part of im essentially a free bishop now since my mother doesnt participate in the games trading i quiz zically thought about this word that i wasnt familiar with huh dont you know trading according to the rules of the rating games its possible to exchange pieces between devils kings on the condition that theyre the same kind of piece heeh so there was also something like that bby the way sekiryuutei please stop it with the sekiryuutei my name is hyoudou issei youre the same age as me right then speaking to me normally is fine everyone calls me ise you know so i
said but si nce shes a devil she can freely choose her appearance cant she though she may look the same age as me could she be older no judging from the times weve met each other i get the sense that shes the same age iis it really okay for me to call yo u by your name eh whats with that reaction shes a bit happy impossible she looks down on me so much after all ccough t then ill oblige and call you ise sama without reservation sama no no its fine without such a thing no this is important hahaha i understand this girl even less than xenovia its difficult keeping company with her and then an onee san that i recognised also appeared ravel sama danna samas20 friend is calling for you if i remembered correctly this person is from risers family an onee san called isabella who hurt my face badly with a flicker her naked body that i saw when her clothes fel l apart is still preserved inside my brain i understand ise sama the next time we meet would you like to have some tea with me a aaand if its
okay with you would you like to have a homemade cake p pprepared by me ravel suddenly raised the hem of her dress curtsied and then left somehow i dont understand that girl very well hey hyoudou issei this time it was isabella san who spoke to me youre isabella san of the phoenix family right yes you gave me a good blow back then i still remember it it seems youve become even stronger when you become even stronger ill be able to boast about my story as well umm are you that girlsravels escort well something like that because that girl has things that she cant grasp as a child like our master riser samasince that battle during the engagement party ravel has only talked about you she seems to have found the fight between you and riser sama very impressive isnt she just complaining since i interfered in her brother s engagement and made some thoughtless remarks to her too no its the opposite well its fine youll understand eventually in any case please tell her that having tea with her would be okay with me really thank you for that ravel will b e happy now
then please excuse me now please have a good time at the party with that isabella san waved her hand and left just like that i really dont get it well theres no use being troubled about it anymore tea is fine right ise senpai y ou surprisingly have a lot of devil friends gasper said that with a look of admiration butdoes it really look like a lot hmm i dont know but i have met various devils since coming here however my encounters with devils besides buchou and my frie nds have a lot of value to me the things i now know like about the problem of discrimination and about dragons were a lot i think that im glad to know these things now not only power but such things may also be important for me to catch up to vali b ut the stupid me also has a limit to my brain capacity hah i wish i had been born smart as i sighed about that a small shadow came into my sight it was koneko chan for some reason she was quickly heading out of the party room her expression seem ed absorbed in something
was there something wrong i was suddenly seized with anxiety i had a bad feeling about this asia xenovia please wait here isesan whats wrong the maou samas greeting will be starting soon no theres a little acqua intance of mine here that i want to go see ill return by the time of the greeting alright well stay here yeah i had lied to the two of them i wanted to keep them safe in any case i stood up from my seat and went into the direction that konek ochan headed in koneko chan went down on the elevator is she going down to the bottom once i confirmed that the elevator next door opened i boarded it then someone else got on the elevator when i turned around it was buchou whats wrong your e xpression changed i saw koneko chan suddenly leave as if following something i see so you were worried i understand ill go too yes but how did you know that i was going to board the elevator to the puzzled me buchou said the best possible thing while smiling its because im always watching you part 6 the elevator arrived on the
first floor after me and buchou stepped out we described koneko chan to nearby devils and asked if she had passed by having discovered that koneko chan had been seen by various people going outside buchou hurriedly called forth a bat familiar and sent it out into the sky buchou and i waited in front of the fountain that stood outside the hotel until the bat returned as i thought koneko chans behaviour i s abnormal yes however what was koneko chan following all the way out here buchou brooded deeply over my question but she said with just a grim expression that she suspected that koneko had come across something serious rather it seemed like buch ou had just realised something after a little while buchous bat returned it seems it found her the forest so shes gone to the forest surrounding the hotel the forest koneko chan just why on earth did you go there buchou and i started running after the bat after we left the familiar places behind buchou and i ran through the forest in the dark night somehow although we were in a hurry to find her i still didnt have any trouble running
like this thanks to the results of my survival life style i could now move relatively easily sensei im somehow scared that i may have grown in a different sense after we had advanced through the forest for several minutes buchou pulled my arm and made us hide in the shadow of a tree when i peeked my face out just a little i saw koneko chan over there koneko chan was restlessly turning her head back and forth in the middle of the forest as if looking for something then she noticed something and turned her gaze in that direction we also followed ko neko chans gaze and looked its been a while hasnt it an unfamiliar voice appearing without making a noise was a woman wearing a black kimono somehow she seemed similar to koneko chanwait she had cat ears on her head i it couldnt be i had a n inkling about something but buchou shushed me and indicated for me to calmly watch you koneko chans whole body shook in violent surprise hello shirone its me your onee chan shirone thats the first time im hearing that name but was i t perhaps koneko chans true
name i knew from buchous mother that koneko was a name given to her by buchou kuroka neesama koneko chans voice squeezed out those words koneko chans onee san i had a feeling thats how it was since they were sim ilar so it was just like i thought so this beautiful nekomata onee san is the exiled demon that killed her masterin the future will koneko chan look like her sister when i imagined it i got slightly excited there was a black cat snuggled up to tha t onee sans feet onee chan is very impressed that you came this far following after this black cat that sneaked into the party nya21 i see koneko chan came across that black cat at the party and came here following it nee sama what is this about there was anger in koneko chans voice but kuroka just smiled dont make such a scary face i just had some minor business to take care of i heard that the devils were holding a big party here you know thats why i was a little interested nyan onee san waved her hand like a cat and winked cutely so cute ooooooooowplease dont
pinch my face like that buchou hahahaha could it be t hat youre a member of the gremory group a voice that i had heard from somewhere before spoke out then a good looking man wearing what looked like ancient chinese armour came out it was sun wukong bikou valis comrade what was he doing here wait h es a member of the khaos brigade is this a terrorist attack aimed at the party hall suddenly bikous gaze turned to look in the direction of me and buchou so he noticed us even if you erase your presence its useless with people like me and ku roka who know senjutsu we can approximately detect you with just a slight variation in the flow of your spirit tch weve been found out even though i would have preferred not to fight buchou and i readied ourselves and stepped out from the shadow of the tree koneko chan was surprised to see us ise senpai buchou yo damn monkey san is vali doing well hahahaha pretty much as for youheh so youve become a little stronger huh hmm did he understand my strength just from looking at my bo dy a little
while i thought that in puzzlement bikou spoke while smiling didnt i tell you i also have an interest in senjutsu and i know the flow of your spirit to a degree the volume of aura that covers you has risen since we last met i see wh en other people said it it seemed that my training really had given me results by the way buchou what is senjutsu is it different from magic and the sorcery used by magicians sighing buchou gave an explanation to my question yes senjutsu is diff erent from magic and sorcery the biggest difference is that senjutsu stresses the importance of something called chakra the aura that is the great original power that flows into ones spirit in other words ones life force and turns it into a constant current its a power that is both similar yet different from the magic of demons and the light power of angels its direct destructive power cant match that of magic or the power of light but senjutsu can make use of the unknown part hidden within plant s animals and people for example if one learned senjutsu its said that they excel at reading
the flow of someones spirit of their aura and that they can also grasp the movements of a faraway target to a certain degree we can also control the flo w of spirit and can reinforce both the interior and exterior of our bodies or disturb the spirits of all the surrounding trees make them bloom or make them wither nyan senjutsu is a skill that manipulates the flow of life after all we can disturb ou r opponents spirit and inflict damage to their life force by cutting it because the methods for repairing the disorder to ones life force is limited for the magic of demons and the sorcery of magicians in comparison this attack method almost always results in death nyan koneko chans onee san explained this while winking im troubled by how she acts so brightly while creating such a dangerous atmosphere at the same time i dont really understand the explanation that well but in other words shes a blooming jii san equipped with a scouter right and moreover this blooming jii san can influence the life of his opponent with a single fingertip right well leaving that aside the problem is the reason why
these guys are here why are you here is t his a terrorist attack i asked this frankly but the two of them just smiled no we didnt come down here for such a thing its just that a standby order has come out in the underworld me and kuroka are off duty right now when the order was given k uroka suggested visiting the devils party since she likely wouldnt return easily i came along with her too okay he chattered on pointlessly this monkey san but as long as he wasnt lying i understood the gist of it in other words when koneko chans onee san inspected the party hall with her black cat familiar or something koneko chan coincidentally came across it and chased it here bikou who is this boy koneko chans onee san pointed at me and asked bikou this the sekiryuutei when she heard that onee sans eyes widened really nyan heh so this is the current breasts loving sekiryuutei who repelled vali before so that was how i was described to her well since its true a breasts loving sekiryuutei huh thats also fine bikou spoke while yawning kuroka lets go back since
we cant participate in that party anyway its a waste to stay here yes lets return but ill take shirone with me nyan since i didnt bring her with me that time arara if you bring her back with you of your own accord vali might get angry you know when they know that the same power as mine flows within her both ophis and vali will be convinced right well that may be so koneko chans onee san smiled widely with narrowed eyes seeing that koneko chans small body shivered she was scared in that case i stepped in between the two of them and spoke ri ght in front of them this girl is an important friend among us of the gremory group i wont allow you to take her away seeing my actions both bikou and onee san laughed no no thats very brave of you but do you really intend to make me and kurok a your opponents this time well leave immediately once we take this girl so itll be fine for you right what kind of nonsense is bikou saying this damn monkey buchou stepped forward with an angered expression this child is my
servant i wont l et you put even a single finger on her araaraaraara what are you saying nya shes my little sister i have the right to love her a high class devil like you doesnt have that privilege biri i understood that this places atmosphere had complete ly changed buchou and onee san were glaring at each other and carried the aspect of an explosive situation it was onee san who stopped glaring first she spoke while giving a wide grin since youre so troublesome ill kill you nyan at that insta nt i was seized by an indescribable sensation what is this this feeling of having transported to another space even though the scenery hadnt changed it was like the air and mood had changed or something kuroka so you learned not only senjutsu yo ujutsu and devil magic but also the skill to control space buchou said this while making a sour face i didnt go as far as learning how to control time but i have fairly picked up on how to control space if i use the essentials of barrier techniques its relatively easy after all i covered this entire forest with a barrier
and isolated it from the outside world nyan thats why even if we do flashy things here it wont leak outside and devils from outside wont come in youre going to get pleasa ntly killed here by us and say goodbye nya what then weve been imprisoned in this forest whats more even if we fight no one outside will notice it ooh so these guys cant be defeated by just me and buchou should we run away no it doesnt se em like we can run away at that time from high in the sky a voice was heard when i received information that miss rias and hyoudou issei had come to this forest and i quickly came to look to think i would be sealed in by a barrier this voice when i looked up there was tannin ossan the monster dragon tannin ossan what timing uwah im really glad it seems he entered this place just before koneko chans onee san spread out the barrier what an ominous aura these visitors arent suitable for this party bikou looked delighted to see this dragon in the sky oh oh oh if it isnt the former dragon king blaze
meteor dragon tannin so you came this is already a big problem kuroka we have no choice but to fight now you seem happy m onkey san very well if we take down two necks that are above dragon king class ophis will also be silent on the matter two necks so i was also counted i was wasnt i no ill die kintoun22 as he shouted that out a gold cloud appeared at bikous feet and he then flew off into the sky where tannin ossan was nyoi bo23 a long staff appeared in bikous hands and he released it while aiming it at ossan exteeeeeeend nyoi bo gyuuuuuuuuun the staff extended and tried to hit ossan but he avoided it with a speed that di dnt fit his huge figure fast even though hes so large he can move himself so agilely once more bikou horizontally moved the staff while it was still extended and chased after ossan who had avoided it the first time but ossan used his wings skilfu lly and rotated in mid air avoiding it the still rotating ossan opened his mouth wide gobaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah a large mass of fire covered the entire sky amaziiiiiiiiiing
that amount is incomparable to what he let out during the time with me looking up the entire sky was nothing but fire thats right sensei did say it that ossans breath of fire was the same level as a meteors impact more significant though is that evasion skill with that huge body even though hes a huge monster he can really move thats right now that i think about it during the game of tag with me he was able to quickly whoosh around despite his huge body so a dragon king has high specs in every kind of ability no tannin was still holding back the power of his breath there seriously ddraig that was holding back its because if he unleashed his true breath not just the party hall but we too would disappear hes thoughtful in his own way even with that though the number of people who can stop t annin are limited i was being pursued on that mountain by such an amazing person thats scary after the mass of fire faded away the form of bikou emitting smoke from his entire body appeared in the air ahaha not bad former dragon king he
was ac tually laughing his armour and clothes were burned but his main body was fine he survived being engulfed by such powerful flames as expected of sun wukong hmph i was wondering what kind of person this sun wukong was you seem quite happy to have received an attack from me tannin the names bikou nice to meet you dragon boss kukukuku you talk like a true monkey do you really understand who you have made your opponent right now im also descended from a legendary demon you know i cant afford to lose so quickly in any case ill be your opponent monkey meanwhile miss rias and hyoudou issei will defeat that cat theyre the master of the sekiryuutei and the sekiryuutei you know youll have to overcome them even if you say somet hing like that this onee san in front of us cant be beaten by me and buchou hahahah youve really gone out big im fine just by myself dont speak so arrogantly monkey youre just a single monkey you wont be any trouble besides what happened to the pig and demon sage24 did you break up with them you mean the descendants of hakkai
and gojou25 hahahaha they including the people of my family are all conservatives every last one of them is satisfied with the current state of things however i love things that are fun thats why i happily accepted the invitation to join the khaos brigade and now act together with the hakuryuukou vali hmph your temperament may be the closest to the first generation of sun wukong but what are you scheming with the hakuryuukou acc ording to rumour only your unit is permitted to move separately from the rest i also heard that youre the only team that didnt accept ophis snake if youd like to know beat me watch what you say damn monkey this place is the hell like under world called the world of the dead know that this is the best place for small fry like you people to repent don dogon ossan and the monkey began to fight fiercely with each other in the air well since it seems like ossan will beat that monkey i m relieved but the problem is nyan koneko chans onee san she was giving a bewitching smile but there was a dark ominous aura permeating her whole body
that even i could feel senseis aura was also black but his had more of a feeling of vice than evil this one here was complete ly evil i could feel a strong malice and killing intent directed at us nee sama ill go with you so please overlook these two people koneko chan had suddenly blurted out such a thing what are you saying i started to speak out but what ar e saying koneko youre a servant of my group i wont allow you to do as you please in a flash buchou tightly embraced koneko chan however koneko chan shook her head its no good i understand best nee samas power nee samas power rivals that of an ultimate class devil for buchou and ise senpaieven with the power of a former dragon king i dont think you can capture my sister who excels in both genjutsu and senjutsu no even so i absolutely wont hand you over to that persons side to t his nekomata that didnt try to help koneko chan who cried so much onee san smiled at buchous anger its because a youkai can not help another youkai however this time i simply
want shirone because i want another piece under my control i can unders tand shirones power better than a red haired onee san like you you know koneko chan shook her head at onee sans words noi dont need that kind of poweri dont need a dark power like thati dont need a power that brings misfortune to people like that she started to tremble and shed tears buchou hugged koneko chan even more tightly kurokayou who had been blinded by power left a wound on the heart of this girl that wont disappear for her whole life after you killed your master and left this child saw hell when i first met her there were no feelings left in her koneko was betrayed by you who was her only family to her lost a future to rely on and was despised and abused by other devils to the point where she was going to be disposed ofshe saw many harsh things thats why i will show her many fun things this girl is toujou koneko rook of rias gremorys group my important servant devil i wont let you put even a single finger on her hearing that koneko chan
began to overflow wi th tears buchooooooooooooou i cried at buchous love even though i wasnt koneko chan i greatly wept because receiving words overflowing with such love is more than servants like us deserve this is why buchou is the best the woman i fell in love wit h is the strongest i dont want to goi am toujou koneko kuroka neesama i dont want to go with you i want to live with rias buchou to live koneko chan cried that out that was a declaration that could also be called her way of breaking off her relationship with her sister alright when you say that i cant pull back either ill protect koneko chan after hearing that onee san briefly showed a bitter smile and then gave a derisive laugh that seemed to freeze my whole body then die suu a thin mist like substance sprung out from onee san it gradually spread and reached us and the fog didnt stop there and continued to cover up the whole forest the mist was really thick i could confirm it in front of me however there was an ominous ai r about it that made me dreadfully shudder
when we came into contact with the fog ah ton at that moment buchou knelt down next to me eh what happened this is next koneko chan also dropped to her knees while covering her mouth wait did buc hou and koneko chan receive some kind of attack hmm so this mist doesnt work on you because youre the sekiryuutei huh its a poison mist which only works on devils and youkai nyan because the poison is thin one suffers a little while it spread throughout the body i wont kill you quickly ill kill you all gradually nyan before i had realised it onee san had sat down on a high tree branch and was looking down on us rather poison mist moreover thats a heartless way of thinking what an evi l intention however i was the only one not affected was it because i was harbouring ddraig in me i didnt really understand the reason very well buchou began to fire magic bullets from beside me don the attack hit onee san completely her body vanis hed we got heror not buchou didnt seem to feel any resistance from her attack that was a good attack but
its useless useless i can easily make a clone of myself with the essentials of genjutsu onee sans voice echoed through the forest s sudde nly silhouettes were born one after another within the mist and all of there were women wearing kimonos they were koneko chans onee san clones so this was an illusion they all looked real and i couldnt tell them apart all these onee sans were wea ring the same auras over their bodies if you cant read the flow of spirit you cant deal with genjutsu used by skilled practitioners koneko chan said that while falling to all fours she seemed to be in pain if there was some kind of counteraction methodcould asia do something if she were here no leaving aside injuries i dont know whether it would be effective on this kind of poison boosted gear i made the red gauntlet appear on my left arm but wasnt the sound just now different from usua l when i looked the light in the jewel wasnt a lot and it had become blackish what was this partner the sacred gear wont move what do you mean ddraig why is it like this at
such a crucial time the sacred gear has entered an ambiguous stat e ambiguous why had it become like that with that training you reached a crossroad i think the sacred gear will change with one more push but i dont know whether that change will be a normal power up or balance breaker in other words my sacre d gear has stopped before a crossroads and is wavering between a normal power up and balance breaker if you put it simply yes in a situation where the choices have multiplied the boosted gears own system is confused on which option to follow so bo th the normal power up and balance breaker look good to it yeah if it does a normal power up you may be able to achieve victory in a flash but if a dramatic change isnt born inside you you wont be able to attain balance breaker but remember this right now you only have a chance to attain balance breaker the rest depends on you even if you tell me such a thing what should i do i dont know what to do even if you suddenly say that i need to go through
a dramatic change what do i have to do t o attain balance breaker damn it if i knew it was going to be like this i should have asked kiba what kind of feeling he had when he did it hey ddraig is it bad if i go for the power up and leave balance breaker for next time you wont be able to grasp this state again whenever you want it may be months or years before the chance comes again then ive been given a very important chance right now it would be wasteful to use it for a normal power up what do i need to do to attain it i dont kn ooooooooooow arara is sekiryuutei chan unable to activate his sacred gear but im going to shoot nyan one of the onee san illusions stuck out its hand began to shoot what looked like magic bullets at buchou and koneko chan who were suffering from th e poison dont joke with me i dashed forward and rushed to become a shield for them dooooooooooooooooooooooon guhah i was hit by blasts full of destructive power it hurts damn it it really huuuuuuuurts i got hit
by one shot right in the front my uniform was also blown away from a direct hit thanks to that my front was naked a place on my chest burst open a little and blood flowed out ise buchou tried to move forward but because of the pain she couldnt stand up well buchou please do nt move the poison will spread through your body dont worry an attack like this is noth doggoooooooooon before i could finish speaking i was hit by another magic bullet guhhah because it was a surprise attack that i had received before i was re ady the pain was intense from just that second attack i fell to my kneesthis is bad if its like this i wont be able to endure five more shots so weak this is valis rival did you really drive away vali onee san simply sneered at mehehehe t ruly just how much more will i continue to be ridiculed like thisim pitiful i wont show my power in a pinch im always like this i cant show my power at critical times did i save asia did i rescue buchou everyone had praised me but in truth it
wasnt like that it wasnt like that asia died once buchou cried once because i couldnt do anything at either of those times it turned out like that power that cant be put to use to prevent others from being hurtthats just wrong i was once ag ain trying to repeat the same thing again i cant rescue koneko chan right here and now i made the people i loved experience sorrowful feelings before because my power wasnt enough after each time i was given a second chance to save them thanks to th e help of others with just that it was meaningless like that what kind of legendary dragon cant save people the first time i wont let you touch buchou and koneko chaaaaaaaaan dooooooooo i was hit by another blast i was blown backwards by its power and my back crashed into a huge tree idiota blow to the backmy consciousness faded for an instant from the great paindamn it my body wont move my body had stopped functioning more from the shock of impact to my back than the painthough im still conscious damn it istood up i was so clumsy and pitiful that tears flowed
from my eyes it wasnt from the pain its mortifying to not be able to display my power when driven into a cornereven though i didnt want anyone to get hurt even th ough i wanted to save everyone my power couldnt stop people from being hurt again while crying i crawled on the ground and approached where buchou and koneko chan were when i came in front of the two of them i pushed fighting spirit into my body nuuuuuuuuu i held down the pain somehow and stood up on trembling legsalright i can still stand however the frustrating tears wouldnt stop you may be koneko chans onee san buti wont forgive you for making koneko chan cry i said this openly and frankly but onee san just laughed for such a weak guy like you to say such a thingshirone is also serious its one thing if a cooler looking and strong prince with a sword says that but when someone like you says it while having blood clinging to yo ur body girls will only draw back nyan how disgusting ise senpai koneko chan whispered to me i spoke while smiling bitterly koneko chanthough i have a
legendary dragon lodged in my body i cant do anythingif i had gotten stronger those times with asia and buchou if i had displayed my dragon power they wouldnt have had such sorrowful experiences im a talentless and useless devil iam an incompetent devil i also cant display the power of my sacred gear very welli truly am worthless even though all the previous sekiryuuteis achieved balance breaker in a short timeit will take who knows how many months for me i understood that i already understood that from the very beginning even though i possess the power of the sekiryuutei its wasted on me because im uselessi cant do anything for you koneko chan i thought i could at least become a shield for you but however koneko chan shook her head ise senpai isnt worthlessdid you know most of the previous sekiryuuteis were pe ople that drowned and lost their heads in their poweri think that they were swallowed by the enormous power they hadmy nee sama is the sameeven if one has powerif they dont have kindnesstheyll definitely go out of controlise senpai is a gentle seki ryuuteieven if your power is a bit lackingthats a wonderful
thingyoure surely the first among the previous ones to be a gentle sekiryuutei thats why koneko chan smiled even though she was in pain from the poison it was a dazzling smile please b ecome a gentle welsh dragon koneko chani after hearing koneko chans words i felt like i understood something inside me buchou i think i understand a little what i was lacking in myself to attain balance breaker yes i felt that i saw the true meaning in koneko chans words just now im probably going to need buchous power in order to attain balance breaker i will attain it by borrowing buchous power i understand if youre fine with me ill lend you my power so what do i need to d o buchou nodded even though she was in pain from the poison i made up my mind took a big gulp and spoke please let me poke your breasts at my request buchou became speechless however after thinking a little she spoke with a look of deter mination i understand if i can realise your wish with that i was bewildered by her ready consent impossible is such a thing possible its no joke
buchou i really do want to poke your nipples rreally i can poke them i can really pres s on buchous nipples with my fingers its really okay burun buchou pulled down her dress and exposed her bared front with trembling hands summoning her great jugs because the thing that restrained them was gone her abundant breasts jiggled bubah to this pure undressing i could only spurt out a nosebleed in reaction please do it quickly i its embarrassing buchou was turning both pale from the poison and red from embarrassment im sorry buchou i didnt think it would possibly turn out l ike this hhey what are you doing in the middle of a battlefield from high above the thin mist tannin ossan gave out an astonished shout ossan please support me while i poke buchous nipples poke her nipples poke her nipples you say what are you saying what are you trying to do in the middle of a battlefield if i poke them the possibility that i will attain balance breaker is high so the training with me was a waste you truly are an idiot at that time koneko chans onee san gave a puzzled expression
hey bikou is that some kind of strategy rias gremory has revealed her breasts and intends to do something with the sekiryuutei dont ask me the thought process of the sekiryuutei is in a different dimension from us you k now what a rude monkey im serious here i think that i have no choice but to poke buchous nipples in order to attain balance breaker the talk i had with sensei had a dramatic impact on me the dramatic change i first thought of after the conversation with koneko chan is to poke breasts because after sensei told me about it that was the only thing that filled my brain and i had wild delusions all this time about just poking them if i poke them i should be able to change having buchous breast s immediately in front of me i wavered oh no this is bad oossan i have a serious problem whats wrong what is it i thought that it was better to ask the former dragon king here the right breast or the left breast which should i poke first you damn idioooooooot right or left its the same thing just poke it already and
attain balance breakeeeeeeeeeer dont joke around right and left arent the same thiiiiiiiiiiiing its important its my first buzzer its a once in a lifetime thing answer seriouslyyyyyyyyyyyyy for some reason me and ossan were quarrelling damn it ossan doesnt understand which breast i poke is an important matter buchou whats your recommendation if its like this ill ask the person herself gee z you idiot in that case you should just poke them both at the same time what a ground breaking idea i shed tears at my masters answer i aimed both my index fingers at each of buchous breasts this is fine with this i wont miss my body was in very bad shape from the damage delivered by koneko chans onee san but this situation where i can poke breasts gave me unbelievable energy then after gulping i suddenly moved forward my fingers as they aimed a t the breasts zumuh munyun munyu munyu munyuuuuuu with this elasticity softness and feel of her skin buchous breasts really were the best without being violent i gently and thoroughly buried my fingers in her breasts bubuh seeing buchous breas ts wrapping around my fingers i spurted a large
amount of blood from my nosebleed at that time iyan buchou let her voice leak out slightly i didnt miss hearing that inside me something revolutionary burst open it spread something vast took over my mind within the tears that wouldnt stop i saw it the beginning of universe you attained it you really managed to attain it ddraig laughed inside me and let out an innocent cry welsh dragon balance breaker the light returned to the jewel and on the contrary began to emit a huge mass of red aura that it didnt have until now the aura wrapped around my entire body youre the worst what a lewd sekiryuutei even though her face was ghastly pale koneko chan gave a retort t o me sorry im a lewd sekiryuutei then the aura which covered my body changed into armour and clad itself on me balance breaker boosted gear scale mail its been achieved here by poking my masters breasts douuuuuuuuuuun my surroundings were blow away by the aura i released a small crater was created with me at its centrealright my body is overflowing with power this is balance breaker partner congratulations but youre terrible im going to
genuinely cry soon ddraig gave me prais e and his voice was tearful yeah thank you and sorry for being perverted so how is my state you can maintain balance breaker for thirty minutes the results of your training have come out for the first balance breaker state of the weak you that s a fairly good time limit how many times can i do my max doubling i think that each time will be used up within five minutes if you release it at the max you can do it five times at the most when you include your other movements your sixth time wi ll be the same as nothing its the same when you use the transfer ability too so if i use this power well i can fight for fifteen minutes you dont need that long look stick out your hand and try firing a magic bullet like usual following ddrai gs instructions i stuck out my hand and aimed at koneko chans onee san doh it fired in an instant it passed right by onee san and went far into the forest the next moment a red flash unfolded doddoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooon the roar of an
explosion ran from far away and the blast even reached all the way here eh what i couldnt react to this sudden event the poison mist was blown away by the blast from the attack and dispersed hahahaha its been a lon g time since ive seen that red blast hyoudou issei an entire mountain far away from here completely vanished just now also the barrier covering this area has been blown off as well tannin ossan said that from the sky above a mountain an entire mou ntain vanished i didnt even fire it with particularly doubled power its the type of attack that fires the collected power from your whole aura through your hands since the amount you can store is still little you cant fire it consecutively thoug h fuhahahahaha you attained it at last i see i see its a surge of great power thats the condition of a good aura ossan also had a big laugh from above thank you it really is thanks to training with ossan as expected rather so the barrier al so disappeared the others outside should also have learned whats going on here with my attack just now ahahahaha there
was someone else laughing it was koneko chans onee sankuroka ha how interesting then ill also show you a mixed shot of you jutsu and senjutsu kurokas hands began to be clad in two different powers each dou just like that she started to shoot two different kinds of surges from both her hands i received it right in the front dodon i felt the impact of the surge blast but there was no pain smoke rose from armour but there was no damage my armour was still solid as usual is that all kurokas expression changed at my lack of damage and she was shocked it didnt work no way i built up a considerable amount of sp iritual power doh i vigorously leaped forward and closed the distance between me and kuroka instantly dont get carried away kuroka began to shoot countless more of the surges from before but i either ploughed through them or flicked them away and approached right in front of her buuuuuuuuuuuun i lunged with my fist but stopped it right in front of kurokas nose the surrounding air trembled from the aftershocks of stopping it and the surrounding plants shook greatly in front
of kuroka who was frightened by my fist attack i spoke dont make my cute kouhai cry if you aim at koneko chan again i wont stop my attack next time you may be a woman and koneko chans onee san but youre my enemy when i pulled back my fist kuroka immedia tely sprang back and put some distance between us you damn brat kuroka cursed me but i saw the fear in her eyes since the armour i wore gave off a pressure that wasnt normal at times like this the impact and intensity of this full body armour was quite effective bikou laughed loudly when he saw that hyahahahahahahaha this is really interesting now there are two dragon bosses itd be a lie to say im not enjoying this twirling his nyoi bo staff around bikou showed his intention to continue fighting this guy also loves fighting just like vali really why are my enemies only like this there are much more enjoyable things than fighting like being popular with girls because our standards of value are different i just cant understand thei r thinking no matter how i think about it rubbing buchous breasts is much
more enjoyable than fighting well its fine beating them here shouldnt be a problem now since the poison mist from before had cleared up buchou and koneko chan seemed to be slowly recovering too with four against two theres nothing we cant do soon devils who noticed something strange was going on would come to help but as we prepared ourselves a tear appeared in the space before us w what was that appearing from out of the tear was a man a young man wearing a suit he held in his hand a sword that was releasing a holy aura to the max w whats with that swordis it a holy sword thats far enough bikou kuroka the devils have noticed wearing glasses the man said this to bikou and kuroka a comrade give me a break another member of the khaos brigade is joining in on the battle shutah bikou descended from the sky arent you valis attendant the man pushed up his glasses and spoke because kuroka wa s being slow i came to see and even bikou is here geez what are you two doing the man sighed everyone dont get near that guy the thing
hes holding in his hand is really troublesome tannin ossan shouted that to us the holy king sword collbrandecaliburn also known as caliburn for caliburn called the beyond strongest holy sword to be with the hakuryuukou is tannin ossan gave a bitter laugh the beyond strongest holy sword so that means hes stronger than either kiba or xenovia but two swords the one thats in a sheath is also a holy sword isnt it the man pointed at the sheathed sword on his back at ossans questions this is the final excalibur that was recently found the stro ngest of the seven excaliburs excalibur ruler excalibur the sword that was broken in ancient times and became seven pieces certainly i had heard that there was one missing butis that really it to be talking like that youre pretty calm a rent you the man nodded at kurokas question yes the truth is that i also have a lot of interest in the comrades of these guys sekiryuutei dono could you please give my greetings to the holy demonic sword user and the holy sword durandal user id like to face them sometime as fellow swordsmen you know what an audacious
attitude i wonder what kiba and xenovia will think when they hear of this now then lets retreat the man then cut the air with the sword called caliburn and another spatia l tear appeared and spread out one that several people could pass through goodbye sekiryuutei the man left with just those words and the other comrades of vali also disappeared into the spatial tear after that we were cared for by all the devils wh o had detected trouble and the maou sponsored party was hurriedly cancelled because of the khaos brigade attack odin what a blunder that was the first thing my vice governor shemhaza said in the conference room within the maous territor y while thinking thats an understatement inside i azazel drank some tea on the day of the maou sponsored party the devils had received an attack from the khaos brigade to put it accurately it would be better to say that that was what the resu lt became that the ss class exiled devil kuroka who is wanted throughout the underworld would use a familiar to watch the party was outside of everyones expectations after that rias gremorys family and the ultimate class
devil tannin came into cont act with her and drove her away the situation was settled with minimum damage but the breach into the party hall was making the other powers question the wariness of the devils just as anyone could see shemhaza kun from the fallen angels side and the seraphim of the angels side were angry well i myself couldnt say anything about them either i also would never say that i the governor was engrossed in cutting loose at a casino at the time either having the treaty violated right away was a grave matter it was a serious problem shemhaza reported more the opponents were members of the khaos brigades independent special unit the vali team consisting of son wukong bikou nekoshou kuroka and also the user of the holy king sword caliburn that three people from a team of people endowed with tremendous power would come is also the management ability of the devils is ah when this guy starts scolding it takes a long while now were done for the incident had been taken under control r ias and koneko had been exposed to poison but thankfully the detoxification had been completed right away
and they only had a minor illness rather since everyone was safe it was a happy miscalculation that ise had attained balance breaker everyone her e seemed to understand in their hearts the maous younger sister rias was safe the sekiryuutei had taken the first step forward the party had been canceled but when looking at the big picture it had been a big gain for us far away from me tannin wh o was attending in the form of a mini dragon and the other seniors were anticipating the battle between rias and sona sitri that would be held soon im going to cheer for miss rias since the sekiryuutei i personally trained is with her kukuku hes an interesting kid poking breasts like that the knowledge that azazel has brought seems to be bringing about a revolution in the rating games if handled poorly there may be a change within the high ranked group within half a year that would be good since the top ten havent changed in the last ten odd years with this it seems like well be able to see some interesting games hahahaha after finishing the arrangements there was no air of tension
here were the three great powers really okay like this at that time the rooms door opened the person who appeared there made everyone dumbfounded hmm so you youngsters cant greet an old man like me huh it was a one eyed old man wearing an old looking hat he had a white beard which was so lon g that it seemed to touch the floor his clothes rather than being luxurious also consisted of just a single robe he held a walking staff but he didnt have it because he hurt his lower back odin yes this guy was actually the king god of all the norse gods odin there was also an armour wearing female warrior valkyrie that had arrived along with him oh oh its been a while hasnt it old geezer of the northern countryside as i rudely called him that odin rubbed his beard its been a whil e fallen angel brat it seems youve become intimate with the people you fought with for so long but are you still thinking of something crafty hah unlike countryside gods that honour old fashioned bonds according to conventional practices or whatev er else we young people have
flexible thoughts rather than sticking to troublesome hostile ways of thinking we place more value on growth and progress thats a losers mindset appropriate for the weak after all youre a gathering of brats that have lost their founding god and maou this geezer as usual his mouth doesnt abate at all its called becoming independent and standing on our own geezer seeing a bunch of brats doing a play meeting like this i cant help but laugh tch at this ra te we wont come to a settlement sirzechs then left his seat and greeted the geezer its been a long time king god of the north odin dono sirzechs i came here on the invitation you gave me to watch the games however youve also had it hard the descendent of the original lucifer is now the hakuryuukou moreover he became a terrorist the future of devils isnt going to be easy odin made those sarcastic remarks but sirzechs simply gave a smile the geezers gaze then shifted to serafall sitti ng next to sirzechs by the way serafall whats with that appearance serafall was dressed up as a magic girl like in japanese television anime this geezer
is also a cosplay lover after all ara odin sama dont you know this is a magical girls o utfit she turned sideways and posed with a peace sign youre talking to the god of the north you know hmm so this is whats popular among the young people these days not bad at all yes yes quite nice damn perverted geezer while putting a hand to his chin he looked down at serafalls panties and legs there was a silhouette that intervened there the aforementioned female warrior valkyrie odin sama you mustnt do such indecent things the reputation of valhalla will cry geez youre so s tuffy thats why you cant get any heroes as a boyfriend the valkyrie immediately broke into tears at odins words hey hey whats with her aat any rate im just an aged female warrior with a history of no boyfriends i too want to have a boyfrien d auuu odin also sighed old man one should only make a young woman cry when on a bed im sorry this person is my current assistant although shes good looking shes too stuffy she cant get a man either i cant understand how the geezer
select s his staff how can a person like that protect you well its fine to quip about other peoples business odin then spoke to sirzechs i heard about it sirzechs serafall your family members are fighting each other right geez making your precious y ounger sisters face each other even though theyre close friends you people are so bad you really are devils if she cant break through this much then her hopes for her future as a devil wont be born its already decided that my sona chan will wi n each maou sama believed that their sister would win after all odin sat in an empty seat and spoke brazenly now then the matter of the khaos brigade is all well and good but i have come to watch the rating game when is the appointed date the talk on the matter at the party was left for another day and the topic shifted to the game that would soon be held lots of important people from each of the powers had been invited to watch the game after all i stood up from my seat for a moment in ord er to take a break and
i went to rest on a sofa in the hallway this discussion and conference with vips was making my shoulders stiff when i sat down on the sofa sirzechs appeared there whats with this did he also slip out he sat down next to me and spoke azazel can i ask you one thing before the games starts what is it if you were facing rias as an opponent who would you definitely remove among the gremory group ise of course everyone in rias team should feel it one way or another that ise is the one who maintains the tension and spirits of the family tension was important in battle it was often the case that the balance would crumble by a single change in that and one side would quickly lose as a result the reverse was also po ssible ise was an emotional pillar for rias and the others the reason for that could also be understood he always runs swiftly forward without giving up no matter what it is or where it is that behaviour of his also became the dynamic energy of the ot her servant devils in part even his master rias depended on
ise it was usual for a dragon to attract others ise wasnt an exception to that either that was a result of people being attracted to the dragon that was lodged inside him as well after all he managed to get through a pinch with that power this time sirzechs joined his hands together and spoke with a serious look sona will aim for that he was worried for his younger sister huh i spoke honestly yeah the problem is when they remove him will their willpower rise or will it fall since they had yet to see ise as the sekiryuutei taken down right before their eyes life4 buchou vs kaichou first half part 1 the night before the decisive battle with the sitri family we gathe red in senseis room and had our last meeting there had been an attack by bikou and koneko chans onee san but the matter had been settled for the time being thanks to them being driven away by buchous group and tannin ossan and things had already sett led down concerning that incident now there was talk of buchou gaining an even higher assessment and value thanks to that battle since valis
team was repelled and she made me attain balance breaker it seemed that the points for these were high wwell it seems like she couldnt report to those at the top that i had attained balance breaker by poking her breasts though it was impossible for her to report it after all so we were having a meeting right away azazel questioned me who had attained bal ance breaker ise hows the state of your balance breaker yes ive managed to get used to it but there are several conditions to it i told my friends about those conditions i was somehow now able to use the balance breaker boosted gear scale mai l but several conditions were attached to it and i was still far from being able to use it freely first when i change into balance breaker it takes time for the transformation to occur the time until the transformation is displayed on my gauntlets jewel moreover when i have entered that waiting period i cant use my sacred gear both doubling and transfer are impossible furthermore i can only transform once per day and even if i cancel the transformation before it ends my sacred gear
will be deprived of almost all its power sensei nodded as i answered his question yeah its just like the data says its almost exactly the same as past the sekiryuutei though there were also cases in which they could use the sacred gear even once they rel eased their armour so whats the time needed for the transformation in your case two minutes so the time was shortened thanks to your training and getting used to it however those two minutes are a matter of life anddeath to put it bluntly it s hardly useful in actual combat above all the time until the transformation during which boosted gear cant be used is just too painful since there are a large number of people that can defeat you within those two minutes you have to think of how you can take care of yourself until you transform those two minutes are your greatest weakness he instantly repudiated my balance breaker right to my face as expected of sensei thats why my objective was also easy to see now though what should i do du ring those two minutes until the transformation did i have no choice but to evade
and run away the normal boosted gears doubling and transfer are also important since they have a wide range of uses however balance breaker is indispensable when fight ing a powerful enemy the normal state and the balance breaker state each have their advantages and disadvantages so for how long can you use balance breaker yes at full i can use it for thirty minutes when i use my power it decreases more that s pretty good for your first time limit thats the results of your training however in an official game that is completely out its out of the question if its just thirty minutes and whats more decreases as you use it more there will also be ga mes with long stretches of distance and time we have no choice but to increase ises time limit from now on so the training i did still isnt enough when will i be able to catch up to vali however balance breaker also depended on the time and situati on i had attained the power i wished for but depending on the circumstances during battle there would also be times when skillfully using the normal doubling and transfer ability
would be better than using balance breaker i could use the transfer abili ty while in balance breaker as well but the chances of me running low on gas would be quite high if i did use it if i beat the enemy before i ran out of gas it was fine but i couldnt guarantee that yeah this really was difficult as i thought of all these things with my very lacking brain sensei made a poking gesture with his hand with a lewd look in his eyes i responded with a smile and poked the air just as he did seeing that sensei offered his hand for a handshake i accepted it yes sensei i attained balance breaker by poking buchous breasts i silently communicated this to sensei both of us mutually filled with emotion we returned to the conversation of the meeting rias sona sitri knows about the gremory group to some degree right at senseis question buchou nodded yes she understands us roughly for example she knows of ise kiba akeno asia and xenovias main weapons video recordings of our battle with the phoenix group were partly open to the public after all furthermore gaspers sacred
gear and koneko chans background have also come to light well she knows roughly about all of you then so how much do you know about her side i know the abilities of sona of her queen the vice president and of several others of her servants though some of their abilities havent been confirmed yet so youre at a disadvantage in that regard well such a thing is fine for a game or an actual battle that is often the case in both the games and in actual battles there are a lso cases of a sacred gear evolving and transforming during battle you should pay careful attention the number of your opponents is eight yes one king one queen one rook one knight two bishops and two pawns for a total of eight enemie s it seems she still doesnt have a full set of pieces yet but its the same numbers as us iyaah the conversation with sensei continued buchou also precisely listened to senseis comments rather so there were eight opponents on our side there wer e eight of us including buchou akeno san kiba koneko chan asia xenovia gasper and me it was the same
numbers next sensei wrote something on a white board he had prepared the rating game classifies players into different particular fighting types power technique wizard support out of these rias is a wizard type the type that is superior in magic in general so to speak akeno san is the same kiba is a technique type he fights with speed and technique xenovia is a power type that excels in the area of speed a player that aims for a one hitcertain kill asia and gasper are support types also if you classify them with even more detail asia is closer to a wizard type while gasper is closer to a technique type koneko is a power type a nd lastly ise youre also a power type however youre also good at being a support type as well with your gift power i was bewildered by all these things that i suddenly had to learn and remember but in other words there were various types within the families playing in the games so im a power type that can also serve as support huh sensei drew lines to form a cross and wrote the names of the four types within
each of the four quadrants of the cross thereby making a chart our names were wri tten on the chart according to location of type i was located in the power type while being situated near support kiba was located in technique xenovia was in power type and each of the other members was located somewhere else on the chart thereby mak ing a diagram illustration that was easy to understand when i looked at it like this werent we a pretty balanced group we didnt have a wizard type that was also situated near power though there was no magic warrior in our group sensei suddenly ci rcled me xenovia and koneko chan in the power types and spoke the things that power types have to be most careful of are counters a troublesome class among the technique types that is the counter type ability there are counter types even among the sa cred gears but when fighting an opponent who carries one power types like ise koneko and xenovia can have their situations turned around by a single counter blow its because counters return the opponents power to them plus the power of the one who co unters
when one is strong its natural for there to be damage just as strong ii see it certainly is scary when your attack is returned to you if the power of my balance breaker state in particular was countered it would cause damage to not only me but my friends as well if theres a counter i just have to overcome it with power xenovia said that bravely however sensei shook his head its possible to overcome it with that but its another story when your opponent is a genius in that field avoid attacking as much as possible its better to face counter users with the spell user akeno the technique user kiba or gasper with his special vampire abilities everything is a matter of compatibility power types are simply strong but the risk is big for them when fighting against technique types xenovia was silent to senseis explanation since xenovia has an abundance of battle experience shed likely understood what he meant sensei turned to look at me ise you have balance breaker now b ut do you think you can win against kiba speaking honestly he would probably toy with me using his speed and receive no
attacks those were my real thoughts certainly ive attained the tremendous balance breaker but when asked whether i can win a gainst kiba the answer is no its impossible for me who has just attained balance breaker to win against kiba who has attained it over a month ago most of all the difference in our battle experience was great from the start the power i displayed du ring the time with vali was temporary it was possible when i was enraged the power of the usual me still wasnt enough thats how it is whether it is against kiba or anyone else you have openings for counter attacks ise if you dont create a counte rmeasure against counter users you will never be able to win against kiba that is what battle compatibility means nuuh so first i have to get past the wall of kiba if i cant cross over that i wont be able to catch up to vali right sensei spoke to buchou rias if there are counter users in sona sitris group they might run into ise you know if a counter eats up his enormous power it will be an instant out you need
to come up with and refine some tactics for that but if the opponent is a female the possibility of that islow buchou what do you mean i wondered about that but i soon knew the answer dress break since hes the enemy of women i dont think theyll want to fight him at all koneko chans sharp words ah what a cer tain kill i see so im the enemy of women buchou was also nodding so it was like that thats right they wouldnt want to fight against an opponent who sends their clothes flying rather koneko chan you seem to have returned to your old self im gl ad because there was that thing the other day i was worried did you possibly break through your problems instead but thats a problem to think i wouldnt be able to face women even though i came up with a new technique during my trainingnow that i ve attained balance breaker i think that its possible my new technique thats in another field than dress break by the way ise the fact that you attained balance breaker was noticed by people nearby during the attack of bikou and the
others sona si tri should also know about it you should be thoroughly careful since the possibility of you being crushed before you transform into balance break is high sensei youre that worriedi gave a bitter smile fuh dont worry im an adult while putting my hand to my forehead i responded with a nihilistic smile whats wrong somehow you were acting as if youve matured a lot sensei im an adult because i poked them giving a thumbs up i nodded vigorously yes i have a special existence that h as poked buchous breasts ive climbed the stairs to adulthood ah i get it i get it sensei please dont talk that way i have just gotten to this point kiba i put my hands on his shoulders what is it to the puzzled looking kiba i told him words of gratitude with understanding eyes there are two kinds of men men who have poked breasts and men who havent poked breasts im the former its unrivaled incredible i have crossed over i thought that was the cleverest remark fufufu kiba youre a happy man since you can associate on equal terms with a man like me who has
poked breasts kiba gave a look of pity and shook his head several times buchou this is no good he needs to receive counselling before the game hmph since ive become a higher being it seems that there are things we can no longer understand each other on however kiba that isnt your fault im the sinner for poking buchous breasts yes im an evil sinner from now on ill introduce myself as darkness wels h dragon fufufu isesenpai is showing a strange smileim scared gya kun dont approach him otherwise youll be infected with idiocy by being close to him gasper and koneko chan were giving me burning gazes butfufufu my charm is even underst ood by male girls and loli kids sensei closed his pen and said a final conclusion id say that the chances of you guys winning in this game is over eighty percent i do believe that youll win but i dont believe youll win for sure and the value of pieces isnt absolute either like an actual game of chess their value changes according to the situation on the board sensei continued everyone listened seriously and attentively his words had great effect in the
root of both the mind and body i have lived a long time in that time i have seen a great variety of battles thats why i will say this i have seen guys win despite having less than a ten percent chance of victory do not take even a one percent chance lightly dont believe that you ll definitely win however think that you want to win no matter what this is the last advice i can give to you all in this training camp that was the last advice sensei gave us this time after that sensei discussed tactics with the members who had be en left out in the conversation until the day of the decisive battle were definitely going to win part 2 the day of the decisive battle there was a huge magic circle underneath the gremory castle for the exclusive use of transporting us to the game a rea our group gathered on top of the magic circle and prepared to transport to the game area where the battle would soon be commencing besides asia and xenovia we were all wearing our kuoh academy summer uniforms asia was in her sister clothes and x
enovia was wearing her bondage like battle clothes that she had worn the first time we met both of them seemed to be full of fighting spirit and the sitri side also seemed to be wearing their kuoh academy uniforms buchous father mother millicas sama and azazel sensei spoke from outside of the magic circle rias youve lost once before win for sure this time fight a battle that wont make you ashamed as the next head of the family everyone else as well okay do your best rias neesama well ive taught you about the things you needed to be informed about this time all thats left is to exert yourselves and go all out sirzechs sama and grayfia san werent here but they seemed to have already moved to a spectators lounge for the exclusi ve use of vips it was said that not only were the leaders of the three great powers present but also vips from the other powers were invited it seemed that sensei would be heading there after this our game was getting a lot of attention as expected a mong the promising young devils the fight between the two little sisters of the
maous was being basked in attention a feeling of tension floated in the air but the magic circle mercilessly began to shine at last the game had begun the place we arri ved at after jumping through the magic circle was a place full of tables this was a wide restaurant somewhere when i thought that and looked at the surroundings it seemed to be a dining floor with fast food restaurants surrounding the tables was this also an exact replica of a real place prepared in a space for our exclusive use the power of devils was just as amazing as usual huh i feel like ive seen this place somewhere before things like the shop arrangement matched somewhere within my memori es i stepped out from this floor a bit and looked around the interior there was a vast shopping mall there familiar stores were lined up within the interior and there was a glass ceilinged atrium light spilled down through the glass this oblong shopp ing mall and this glass atrium they were ones that i knew well i didnt expect that the department store near kuoh academy would serve as the stage buchou said this as
she came up next to me yes the game stage was the department store we often went to at that time we heard an announcement in the store everyone i the queen of the lucifer group grayfia will be carrying the role of arbiter in the rating game between the gremory group and the sitri group on this occasion just like during th e battle with riser the announcer was grayfia san but wasnt her introduction slightly different from last time that time she called herself a servant of the gremory family yet this time she clearly stated that she was part of the lucifer group was i t because the quality of the game was slightly different from last time in the name of my master sirzechs lucifer i will watch over the battle between these two families its a pleasure to be here to get right to the main topic the battlefield for today is the department store within the neighbourhood of the school kuoh academy that rias sama and sona sama attend which has been prepared within a separate space as the game field since the game field was once more somewhere that we were familiar with
you would think that it would make things easy for us but the same goes for the sitri group as well since theyve also come to this department store many times this department store which had become our battle stage was a two storied building it wasnt that big in terms of height however it was a long shopping mall across its two floors and the atrium so it was considerably large horizontally the rooftop was a parking lot besides that there was also a multi storey parking garage elsewhere both groups have been transported to their respective bases rias samas base is on the second floor of the east side while sona samas base is on the first floor of the west side in order for pawns to promote please go to your opponents bases our base and our enemies base were on opposite ends of the department store we were on the most eastern side of the second floor the opponents were on the most western side of the first floor around our base there was a pet shop an arcade centre a dining floor a bookshop and a drugstore on the first floor beneath our base there
was a branch store of a major second hand bookshop company and a sports supplies shop over on the opponents side there was a grocery shop an electrical appliance s tore a junk food shop and a general goods store during the battle each side would have to respectively head towards the other end of the department that was simple and clear but it wouldnt go like that this time there will be special rules docum ents on this have been sent to each group so please check them a single bottle of the healing item phoenix tears has been provided to each team furthermore the time to strategise before the battle is thirty minutes contact with the opponent during t his time is forbidden the game is scheduled to start after thirty minutes then let the strategy time begin after the announcement everyone quickly gathered together we couldnt waste even one minute of this time the battlefield is modeled on the d epartment store near kuoh academy so its an indoor battle buchou said this while looking at a guide map of the department stores interior that was depicted on the dining floors wall there was also a personal
diagram of the place divided into chess s quares in buchous hands we had encamped ourselves in the aforementioned dining floor and were planning out our strategy an indoor battle so the rating game has that kind of battlefield as well i thought about how each side had a base on this certainly wide battlefield and how we would have to run around within this field it was like that during the house of phoenix battle as well rather the stage was the department store near our school this was a place we often came to on our way back from school more than ninety percent of the students attending kuoh academy knew about the appearance of the stores interior me buchou and asia have also come here on our days off buchou looked over the document with the special rule that had been sent to us the rule this time states dont destroy the department store which has become the battlefield in other words we cant do any showy battles buchou narrowed her eyes and seemed to be thinking about this rule i see so to me the fukubuchou26 and ise this is a disadvantageous battlefield we cant do
attacks that affect a wide area it was just as xenovia said by saying that it was an int erior battle and furthermore that the building itself couldnt be destroyed i couldnt use my boosted gear raised dragon shot the great fire attack that used doubled fire magic which i obtained at great pains in the training with tannin ossan was also impossible here it would turn into a conflagration akeno san also couldnt use her extra large lightning attack by creating thunder clouds unless she was on the rooftop right it seemed that if she didnt suppress her power she could deal damage to th e building as well xenovia also wouldnt be able to unleash her holy slashing wave with durandal either even at the best of times it was a sword that gushed out a holy aura even in its drawn state so it couldnt be recklessly swung in order to not brea k the rule that really is troublesome a battle of large mass attacks has been mostly sealed akeno san put a hand against her cheek with a troubled face she gave her opinion after letting out a sigh gasper kuns eyes also wont be
as effective ther e are too many places to hide within the department store all the goods and products have also been exactly reproduced so there is an overflowing amount of objects to obstruct his vision there is also the possibility of surprise attack in the darkits troubling this is a disadvantageous battlefield for our special characteristics because the rias gremory groups forte is to battle showily were completely sealed damn i believed that we were strong but everything has completely changed just becaus e of this rule buchou shook her head at akeno sans words no gaspers eyes couldnt be used from the start they put in a restriction on it here the use of gasper vladis sacred gear is forbidden it says the reason is clear and simple since he st ill cant perfectly control it yet they judged that it would be problematic if the entire game was spoiled by his eyes going out of control giving him ises blood is also prohibited it seemed that theyve provided him with sacred gear sealing glasses de veloped by azazel since it was made for gaspers exclusive use it wont have any particular bad influence on his body so
it says here really he likes to prepare what another problem so gaspers sacred gear couldnt be used now that you mention it i heard that gaspers training didnt go well in regards to his sacred gear he made a lot of progress but it seems it will still take quite a bit of time for gasper to master his eyes besides i doubt it would be good even if he simply unleashed it then will gasper fight using magic and his vampire abilities buchou nodded at my question thats right from the beginning his time stopping power carried a lot of risk the other side has not only the counter types i mentioned before but also saji kun who possesses a sacred gear that absorbs the ability of others so we dont know what kind of counterattacks theyll use like suppressing it with genjutsu there are also other techniques to take away a persons vision when talking about such things it becomes impossible to use that power in either the games or actual battle using meticulous caution is only natural vali also said the same thing as buchou that if you know that the ability activates from the eyes
its easy to deal with it buchou continued ah gasper had put on the glasses right away the rating game isnt something you can win simply by having a lot of power the battle situation changes completely according to the battlefield and rules because this is a ground where even dev ils that lack strength can depend on wisdom and rise higher it has become popular in the underworld and among the other powers the rules this time may be disadvantageous to us however if we cant make up for this we wont be able to win and advance in the games from now on even a pawn can take down the king this is not only a basic rule in chess but also a proverb of the rating games in other words it implies that anyone can win with the proper method akeno san also approved of buchous wo rds and nodded thats right there may be indoor battles like this on true battlefields as well from now on if that were the case we wouldnt be able to completely display our power like today this may be a good opportunity for us todays battle is m ost suitable
for getting used to indoor team battles among this discussion where all the smart people were talking i timidly raised my hand uumm buchou while i desperately trained to attain balance breaker and raise my power i didnt practice hold ing back my power when fighting i know this time things came completely opposite from what we expected although the battlefield and rules are decided randomly this game may be close to being the worst for ise your power is too enormous according t o the rule destroying the building means an instant out however theres sure to be somewhere where youll be able to use balance breaker but please hold back your power as much as possible while fighting dont shoot your dragon shot as much as possibl e as well the department store may be blown away please survive with just hand tohand fighting somehowim sorry for asking such difficult things from you yyes rather to be honest im really worried but seriously as a power type i was reall y at a disadvantage at a time like this oh well since im aiming for the top and will be participating in the games from now on i
have to get used to this kind of battle as well i cried at having to face so many difficult things i had never imagined that the training i spent most of my summer on would have no meaning in this game now that i think about azazel sensei also talked about it attaining balance breaker will certainly become a weapon for you however thats not something absolute in the games there are devils with servants without balance breaker that manage to rise up you know i didnt really understand it then but now i do with such a battlefield and rule balance breaker wasnt always a knockdown technique while i fell into desp air buchou continued her strategy plan even if we attack the atrium of this shopping mall is a problem you can grasp the progress of the opponent from both the first and second floors its the same for the other side buchou said this while looking at the interior of the store akeno san also expressed her opinion ive considered an attack from the parking garage as well but they would also be looking out for that too yes its the same for moving from the
rooftop whether it be breaking throug h the centre from the rooftop or from the parking garage we have to advance along these routes since we cant leave the department store itself there should be cars in the parking garage as well thats what i feel after seeing that they reproduced even the merchandise and merchandise shelves they may have copied the cars that were parked there the discussion between buchou and her queen akeno san had somehow become really diligent yeah this reconfirmed once again what the queen was to the king kiba raised his hand and gave a proposal buchou ill go look at the rooftop and parking garage since there are stairs nearby ill go check them out buchou nodded please do yuuto kiba immediately headed out at a quick pace are the cars important somehow i asked that question honestly why were they that worried about the presence of cars here if they plunge into the store interior with a car itd be serious you know besides we have to openly consider the possibility that theyll use the car itself as a bomb though i dont think that someone like sona would do something like recklessly
driving inside the department store so said buchou ah i see she really is thorough about this everything on the battlefield can also become a weapon when thought of like that a car was a big weapon youre really cautious naturally i still feel like this isnt enough its also possible for someone to rest and hide inside cars now that i think about it we havent seen the inside of th e staff room before we should go check iteven if we have ises dress break there are many clothes in brand stores within the mallsince its a department store there are an endless number of things to consider buchou seemed to be considering even t he minute details she didnt want to overlook anything buchou then gave instructions to gasper next gasper please change into bats and fly to every location within the department store in the opening of the game youll inform us of the situation wit hin the department store in detail rroger ooh gasper also had some fighting spirit thats right to him this is his first game the strategy planning continued on after that as well and we decided on even the minute tactics
then once half the ti me had passed since the strategy session started we had solidified our plan buchou looked around at us and spoke the game will be starting fifteen minutes from now well gather here again in ten minutes everyone please remain on standby with your re spective methods of relaxing until then at buchous words we all broke up and walked away however buchou called out and stopped just me ise since you attained balance breaker the power of the eight pawn pieces i placed in you have all been forci bly released yes it was just as buchou said by attaining balance breaker the power of the sealed pieces inside me had been released with this you may be able to completely use ddraigs power but your body still cant handle it ddraig should also save power in order not to break your body be careful if you make a mistake with the sekiryuuteis power the hosts body will be destroyed yes ill be sufficiently careful buchou it had finally been released one day id like to be able to compl etely control ddraigs power from the start my value as a pawn was almost completely
made of ddraigs value the power flowing inside me is ddraigs power being able to control ddraigs power is my true value i have to keep that in mind after that buchou entered a shop on the dining floor and began to pour herself some tea so she was enjoying some tea until the time came gasper was eating donuts at a donuts shop asia and xenovia were talking about this and that in front of a hamburger shop kiba was rummaging through the drugstore beside the dining floor i see since it seems like medicines and the like were copied as well he was trying to find things to take everyone was trying to spend their time until the starting time with their own respect ive relaxing methods so then i as well i left that place and entered the bookstore near the dining floor gufufufu somehow it was just like i thought this bookstore was perfectly reproduced just like the rest of the mall i went to the ecchi book co rner and looked for ero books by myself inside the empty store its here its here amaziiiiiiiiiing i could read all these ero books as much as
i liked so there were also nice battlefields like this ah which should i look at was this the feeling o f a treasure hunter who had found an amazing amount of gold and silver treasure i could pick and choose as i like was it possible for me to bring these all home i want to take them home with me since i began living with buchou and the others my two ba d friends and the boys in class have said that i didnt need ero books thats not true thats not true at all that is that this is this because even if i lived with buchou like this i might be hated if i tried to make a move on the other hand not knowing what to do my on sexual desire as a healthy male high school student made me live in anguish every day because of this i had to vent myself everyday for the things i couldnt do with buchou and the others ah if i could make a harem i could do ecchi things every day and i wouldnt need these kinds of books until that day i have to look at
ero books since buchou and asia were in my room it was also difficult to read them in any case i took out and read one of the books in front of me uhyoh breasts really are amazing but as i thought when compared to buchous and akeno sans beautiful and big breasts these ones still have a ways to go fufufu but it was also spicy to look at the breasts within this ero book while remembering the sensa tion of touching theirs isekun what are you doing ara ara youre reading very dirty looking books its the remaining time before the decisive battle you know munyuuuuuu i felt something with first rate softness on my back it was breasts moreo ver i remembered this sense of texture and this voice as i thought its akeno san she was clinging to me from behind and was checking out what i was reading from the side aakeno san t this is i was just checking the extent to all the copied objec ts had been reproduced that was a lame excuse even for me but akeno san didnt seem angry and just kept her sweet smile ufufu im not particularly
angry at you for this i dont despise you for it either rather im relieved at how isekun this is akeno san is more tolerant about things like this than buchou then akeno san looked at the book i was reading with a serious expression i see so ise kun likes this kind of thing for some reason her eyes really seemed serious as expected is the ecchi onee san also very interested in ecchi books aakeno san while i was troubled about her reaction akeno san pointed at the actress photographed in the ero book shall i wear something like this next time the thing that akeno san was pointing at was the cosplay costume for ecchi games that the actress wore but this was practically nude the area covered by cloth is so small you wouldnt be able to put on underwear either sseriously i reflexively asked that is this for real seriousl y ufufu since its ise kun its special she replied with a smiling face amazing akeno san will put on such an outfit i had to seriously order this next time i see so ero cosplay really existed this is bad my delusions wouldnt stop
this was ni ce and that was also nice too while i was having non stop delusions like this akeno san embraced me from behind even tighter aakeno san what are you doing im getting courage from ise kun akeno san had a painful voice i was surprised at the s udden change but courage huh now that i think of it buchou had also said that she was getting courage by grasping my hand during the meeting between the three great powers i need the courage to fight because i might have to use the other power that flows inside me this time im scared i hate it thats why im getting courage from ise kun akeno san so shes resolved to use the fallen angel power that she hates it was a power that she didnt wish for yet flowed inside her but the circumstan ces that we were in here didnt permit that denial if she doesnt accept it she cant advance forward it was something i didnt understand but i thought that it was a very tough thing if youre fine with me please fully get courage from me i gras ped akeno sans hand as
she embraced me and spoke while smiling if akeno san could gather courage from someone like me it was the best when i bring out my power of light will you watch ise kun if ise kun is watching i will be able to use it yyes if akeno san can display her power just by me watching its a small price to pay im happy if im together with ise surely you belong to rias but even so i will always by your side akeno san seemed to say something in a low voice that i coul dnt hear akeno san moved away from my back but her eyes were moist suddenly akeno san brought her face close to mine this time aakeno sans lips were ise senpai its almost time to gather when mine and akeno sans lips were just about to t ouch koneko chan unexpectedly appeared uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah w wwe were seeeeeeeeeeeen this is bad this is bad just a little more and i would have seriously kissed akeno san because because its akeno sans lips they were incredibl y attractive but if buchou learned of this i would be killeeeeeeeeeeeeed if i her servant and pet
become intimate with someone else she would destroy me kkoneko chan this is umm i tried to come up with an excuse while being flustered but kone kochan just sighed with half closed eyes araara koneko chan you saw us ufufu ise kun thank you im already okay now akeno san returned to her usual pleasantly smiling face and tried to leave this place however next time for sure with yo u she left behind some kind of whisper her expression as she left seemed regretful at having to part no it was my mistake akeno san was surely just trying to approach me in s mode as i nodded with certainty on that koneko chan grasped my hand kkoneko chan i was surprised by koneko chans sudden action but she spoke while blushing red please give me courage too i see this girl was also going to try using the power she had suppressed until now her hand was trembling she was very scared she feared that her nekomata power might swallow her up sure if youre fine with me i grasped her hand back with a smiling face if akeno san and koneko chan could obtain the courage
to get over their problems by holding someone like me it was a s mall price to pay ise senpai arent you afraid of me as a nekomata koneko chan asked me this with an anxious expression no not at all i answered calmly eh why would i be afraid of koneko chan rather how could i be bothered by her lovely cat ear form i knew her circumstances but i couldnt see a reason why i should be afraid of koneko chan hearing that koneko chan looked completely astonished but her face looked down before the training began i said something horrible to ise senpai ah so its about the time i spoke care freely and koneko chan got angry you dont have to worry about that i was also at fault then although i didnt know your circumstances i was an inconsiderate senpai that isnt true koneko chan grasped m y hand harder ill use my nekomata power i was surprised by koneko chans words i hate what nee sama became but as things are now i may not be able to be useful to everyone thats why ill use it she had a resolved look so she
overcame her problem when she met with her sister and declared that she would break off her relationship with her koneko chan youll surely overcome your nekomata power in the future and someday become a hellcat underworld cathell cat yes its written as cat of the underworld and read as hell cat27 like this though it was a method of encour agement even i wasnt sure about i declared further ill declare this to koneko chan too even if you run out of control with your nekomata power ill stop you i want to use this sekiryuutei power not only for myself but for my friends too and even if that scary onee san comes again ill definitely save you since ill blow away that nee chan with a punch you dont need to be scared that was my best encouragement because im unfortunately an idiot i couldnt give any smarter words than this th ats why if it comes to it ill risk my life and save this girl you really are a gentle sekiryuutei she seemed to murmur something but i didnt hear it i think i heard gentle but by the way your cheeks were a deep
red koneko chan why was i making an ero face again part 3 it was the appointed time we had gathered at the dining floor and were waiting for the starting time then an announcement streamed through the store it is now time to begin furthermore the time limit for this game will be a blitz style of three hours then without further ado game start game start wait blitz so they decided that to give it a short time limit so there were also cases like this so this is why they gave us strategy time before this it was bec ause they change the rules every time huh the rating games are profound buchou stood up from her seat and spoke with an expression filled with fighting spirit your instructions are just as we agreed on before ise and koneko and yuuto and xenovia wil l split into two separate groups ise and koneko will advance through the store interior yuuto and xenovia will advance forward via the parking garage gasper will transform into many bats and do surveillance and reporting inside the store according to t he condition of your progress me akeno and asia will go
by the route of ises group we listened to buchous instructions and we fitted communication use microphones in all of our ears now then my cute servant devils we wont lose again this time well win yes everyone was filled with fighting spirit naturally we cant lose like that again well win for sure then xenovia lets go yes kiba kiba and xenovia headed out first they rushed out from the dining floor and headed down the path that connected to the parking garage according to kiba it was confirmed that there were cars in the parking lot however they seemed to be mere imitations so charging using the car was apparently impossible now then we were next to leave after kiba and xenovia koneko chan lets go yes me and koneko chan left that place behind and headed out koneko chan had already told everyone that she would use her power buchous reading was this she predicted that the enemy would read our movements as following i would burst into the base while avoiding battle as much as possible in order to promote myself to queen the quick witted kiba and xenovia would move together and go around back
through the parking garage to the base there they would d isturb the enemys formation and attract the attention of the enemy in order to promote to queen they would quickly distract and lead the enemy away from their base when i became queen everyone would temporarily pull out and then attack once again buchou would also move out at this time in any case making me the sekiryuutei promote to queen was considered most important or so it would seem buchou assumed that kaichou would read us like this and so did the opposite instead i was moving forwar d just as kaichou would predict they would also receive an attack but our true main offence was kiba and xenovia it wasnt a diversion but a genuine attack instead i would be the feint since the opponent would aim at me and send out several assassi ns buchou predicted that the area around the king would be short staffed of course assassins would also be sent after the parking garage group but we expected that it wasnt secured that much and would be assaulted by kiba and xenovia meanwhile we would aim at the king and claim checkmate the
tactic for using my sekiryuutei power was different this time i wasnt playing an active power role since i was a top member of buchous family i have to combine my power with everyone elses ise good luck isesan do your best dont lose ufufu i expect to see your cool side buchou asia and akeno san all had high expectations of me uooooh i have to show my good side wait even if i fight theyd only be able to see it later from the recor ded videos me and koneko chan advanced at a subtle pace that was neither quite running or walking since sound echoed in the store interior the opponent would be able to judge our distance from them if we ran moreover the store interior was a horizonta lly long shopping mall that extended in a straight line towards both ends we had no choice but to advance while concealing ourselves beneath cover well even if we called it a big department store it wouldnt take even ten minutes to walk from end to end we moved while being attentive of that hmm there were no enemies in sight five minutes had already passed since
the game began but because we were moving forward while being on alert wed only progressed through a quarter of the place we appeared to be evading battle while we were actually acting as a diversion i was nervous then next to me koneko chan grew cat ears on her head those ears moved with a piko piko whats more she even grew a tail what deadly cuteness strange i was this exc ited even though i didnt have a loli fetish did i have a beast loli fetish koneko chans nekomata mode was deadly cute koneko chan pointed somewhere far away with her finger and spoke theyre moving there are two people straight ahead moving tow ards us you can tell yes because i released a part of senjutsu in my current state i can read the flow of spirit fairly well naturally i cant grasp the fine details of it but i see but were those cat ears like sensors how incredibly handy this is the senjutsu which can read the spirit of ones entire surroundings thinking about it nekomatas can understand everything that happens to a certain degree through smell after all since shes a cat her
nose was better than devils like me with a human base how long until we meet up with those guys who are heading towards us at this pace most likely within ten minutes ten minutes huh we had better prepare ourselves should i use my sacred gear normally or should i use balance break er i wavered between them but i still didnt know what kinds of abilities the opponents had my strong point was my simple physical strength that i prided myself on i barely had any magic even if i increased my magic power with my sacred gear i would quickly run out of gaseven if i had strong power if i mistakenly used it i would instantly lose i was always in a dangerous situation i had to bear at least that in mind koneko chan was looking at me seriously was it my imagination that her cheeks were red no ise senpai wears a warriors face when its important even though you usually have a lewd look seriously did i really have that kind of lewd face normally w well its because im having erotic delusions everyday after all as i was touching my face with
my hand koneko chan suddenly looked up at the ceiling ahead of us above what what as i followed the gaze of the surprised koneko chan stretching straight up to the ceiling was a rope no a line descending from the ce iling using that tarzan like rope was hyoudou the first attack is ours it was saji he prepared to attack me while positioning himself for a knee kick moreover there was someone on sajis back i quickly guarded using my gauntlet as a shield dogo n the impact of the combined force of the momentum of their fall the kick the weight of two people was transmitted to my body through my gauntlet my stance shook from the force of the attack but i somehow recovered and i prepared to advance on theenemy in front of me yo hyoudou saji had appeared next to him the one who had been riding on his back was a girl a member of the student council huh i think she was a first year student she often acted together with saji from behind him sajis r ight arm had a black snake wound around it several times its shape was different
from before there had just been a deformed lizard head there before did his sacred gear change wait there was a black snake wound around my gauntlet on my left arm as w ell and it was connected to sajis sacred gear he must have put it on me when he attacked before there was also a line connecting to my right hand butit wasnt connected to sajis sacred gear rather it seemed to be tied to something far away was th is line connected all the way to the enemy base it was weird but it didnt feel like my power was being sucked away saji noticed that i was looking at his sacred gear and spoke while smiling bitterly well i did some training the result of that is t his so when i had stuck a line in the ceiling and rose up in order to observe the store interior from above i saw two people hiding under cover further away since you didnt notice me i used that brief chance to do a tarzan attack i see so thats h ow you arrived here yeah i understand somehow if i had gotten here first i would
have done the same to you i understand somehow you also think that right hey saji were similar you and i from head to toe were similar when it comes to our lew dness our earnestness towards our masters our idiocy and our tendency to plunge straight forward only we really are too similar thats why i understood it right away that you and i will fight today i also trained i spent almost all my summer vacat ion being chased by a dragon sorry saji i will beat you and advance forward winning today is whats most important for us i have to get closer to vali he will aim at me at some point at that time he may hurt buchou asia and the others for the sa ke of preventing that i will become strong i cant stop at a place like this yes at that moment when i was filled up with fighting spirit an unbelievable announcement reached the ears of me and koneko chan rias gremory samas bishop retires what which one hadnt the game just started asia was with buchou so saji grinned the one that was taken out is most likely gasper kun
gasper was taken out that was too fast wasnt it wasnt he transformed into bats and moving around the insi de of the store for the sake of surveillance gasper was caught saji continued as i thought dubiously we were contacted and told that gasper kuns sacred gear was sealed according to the rules as such it was inevitable that he would use his vampire powers instead he will change into bats and observe the situation within the store this is what kaichou thought so we utilised our base your base that was the grocery store saji continued further first one of our members moves suspiciously at t he sitri base then gasper kun who was doing surveillance would naturally be interested and follow them you know then when we showed more suspicious behaviour he would call the other bats he had launched and start to observe with several of them when all the many bats had gathered thats when it happened if something happens to the bats when all of them are gathered they revert back to gaspers body near the place where the bats had assembled together was garlic a vampires greatest dislike our base is a grocery
store on the first floor of the west side there were large quantities of garlic left there it was easy to catch gasper with that so they captured and took him out while he was incapacitated by the smell of garlic no way so there was such a way to deal damage to him its pretty simple right but even if i say that this method of taking him out wont work again kaichou said that no matter how much training he did he still wouldnt be close to overcoming his aversion to garlic ye t it was a lucky coincidence that we had a base at such a location but even so a defeat is a defeat so youre saying it was his blind spot no no matter how effective it is on you you should be able to withstand garlic to a point gaspeeeeeeeeeeeee r from the start that joke is too overdone already gyasuke after this were doing practice to make you overcome garlic ill replace your normal food with garlic rice and garlic toast you cant just withdraw from the front lines without doing suffic ient surveillance having gotten mad i tried to activate my sacred
gear but partner doubling is dangerous now that youre connected to that guys sacred gear youll have part of your power stolen by him if you double thats right sajis sacre d gear has the ability to suck in energy from the thing it is connected to now that my sacred gear and his sacred gear are connected doubling is dangerous to detach this line you have no choice but to blow it away by using the aftershocks from activat ing balance breaker damn it my hand was forced right from the outset ill activate balance breaker and blow away this line start count down the time until balance breaker was displayed on the jewel and the count had begun now that its like this i cant use my normal sacred gear abilities i couldnt use either doubling or transfer until i transformed into balance breaker for two minutes i had no choice but to evade sajis attacks this was a short decisive battle well use the momentum of activating balance breaker to continue on all the way to the king and the likely candidates for doing that were kiba and xenovia ill act as a diversion and attract the
enemy here in order to get some distance i tried to temporarily draw back from h ere but i was pulled by the line and lost my balance as i thought sajis sacred gear really is troublesome are you running away hyoudou in an instant the space between us was shortened and don a kick was delivered to my abdomen gahoh my upper body was pulled down by sajis kick but i had already put strength into my abs and avoided the worst of the damage hehehe its because i properly did my basic training i had confidence in my abs heh even though i kicked quite seriously there you a lso seem to not have done incomplete training having not given the damage he had thought he would saji smiled bitterly its impossible to run away here then ill just attack from the front i gave up on getting some distance from saji and suddenly he aded towards him i wasnt that good at fist fighting with my body but i had accumulated plenty of basic training i had made a body just for the sake of close combat all thats left is to believe in my own body
i clenched my fist and tried to strike at saji but saji fired a line at me from his right arm does he intend to suck away my power i was on guard but the line went passed me and attached itself to a certain stores light nimura put on the sunglasses we got at that store just before saji and his kouhai took out sunglasses from their pockets and put them on what were they just as i wondered this i immediately understood the meaning behind it kah the store lighting issued a blazing light and burned me and koneko chans vision damn it theyve blinded us they got you he caused a burst of light for just an instant by connecting his line to the light and sending magic power into it dont explain it so calmly ddraig its no good i cant open my eyes dogon guhah once again i received an impact in my abdomen because i didnt strengthen my abs this time i received the damage completely then while my body was hunched over i received another blow from saji to my back ooooooooooow the pain was welling up inside me and th en my
jaw bagan an uppercut like attack from saji sharply shot through my jaw from such a considerable impact i fell face down on the floor kuhhe got me he had completely stolen the beginningmoreover he gave me considerable damage my teeth ratt led from the impact to my jaw i had also gotten a cut in my mouth from it the taste of blood spread within my mouth my eyesight was restored and while still face down on the ground i looked up and i saw saji point his hand at me and trying to fire a magic bullet at me he intended to deliver the finishing blow right away i quickly got up and rolled over to the side don a big hole was made in the floor from the magic blast he fired what power it was completely a finishing blow move its dangerou s i was going to exit the stage before i activated balance breaker i wouldnt be able to say anything about what happened to gasper then not bad saji hyoudou im serious im going to seriously defeat you the sekiryuutei sajis eyes were fi lled with resolution i could tell that his seriousness was
tremendous then saji raised his hand and tried to fire another magic blast don he fired another high volume mass of magic the size of it wasnt considerable though mostly like he was follo wing the rule that said that not to damage the building as much as possible but the attack was powerful enough to take down an opponent like me i dodged and the store i was standing at before was destroyed by the blast of magic however how did saji c reate such an attack i had heard that he had low magic like me yet how was he able to release such power at that moment i opened my eyes widely because sajis sacred gear had its line connected to his chest to his heart the source of sajis contin uous attacks was his life force saji you are you converting your own life forceinto magic power thats right with my low magic this is the only way for me to shoot powerful attacks i convert my life force into magic power using my sacred gear s ability its just as you see im risking my life as it were do you really intend to die
sajismiled with a serious look yeah i intend to die i intend to beat you with the intention of dying do you understand our frustration having our dream laughed at do you understand our desperation as we believe in our dream this battle is being broadcast across the entire underworld we have to show the seriousness of the sitri group in front of those guys that laughed at us suddenly i remember ed that scene yes this is similar to the time where i marched into buchous engagement party i didnt consider my own life and simply poured my first into rescuing buchou i just thought of helping buchou even if i died this battle overlapped with th at scene saji youre the same as me from back then as me and saji were going through a fierce battle of dodging and drawing near at that time koneko chan and sajis kouhai had started attacking and defending against each other next to us koneko chan w as superior in hand tohand fighting even so though the female opponent was hanging on well and the battle was intensifying however after koneko chans fist grazed her opponents cheek a change occurred the
body of sajis kouhai shook just a little her eyes also seemed to be swimming just a bit did she receive damage from the shockwave of koneko chans fist koneko chan didnt miss the opening she clad her fist in a pale white aura and drove it into her opponents chest bang a good sounding nois e rang through the surroundings at that instant sajis kouhai dropped to her knees i drove a fist clad with spirit energy into you since damage was also dealt to the blood vessels flowing inside you at the time you wont be able to build up magic anymore furthermore the damage also pierced through your insidesyou cant move anymore so said koneko chan sensei had said this before konekos true fighting style which mixes senjutsu and hand tohand combat will certainly become a weapon an attack that not only deals damage to the opponents body but also their blood vessels that circulate within their body will break the enemys aura from its foundation however if she becomes consumed by power she must stop using it immediat ely senjutsu can read and handle spirit energy but it also takes in the malice and ill will
that floats in the world konekos sister became like that because she absorbed too much malice as well this was koneko chans fist shot she fired a blow fille d with spirit energy it dealt external damage of course but its main destructive power was the damage it dealt within the body it sent spirit energy that was charged within her fist into the opponents body and dealt damage to their internal organs even if the damage from the punch itself didnt penetrate as long as the fired spirit energy destroyed their interior the effect was enormous so i saw in some book i wasnt trained in internal organs a punch that dealt damage to the interior so this was the attack that koneko chan had sealed if she uses it well she may be the servant with the most effective attack among us saji senpai im sorry after she let just those few words leak out the kouhai shone and disappeared she had retired and been transferred away because she had sustained serious damage sona sitri samas pawn retires we heard another announcement with this each team had lost one person i have become a hellcat i wont lose
now then since koneko chan has decided while looking cool i have to exert myself as a senpai as well however i was having a hard time with just dodging sajis magic bullets i would receive considerable damage if those even grazed my body with that much magic power loaded into them it was quite considerable stuff it was literally with his spirit and soul haahaahaahaa but sajis exhaustion from repeatedly firing that magic was also quite severe he wont be able to keep it up ise senpai ill help koneko chan tried to come over no koneko chan please let me do this just between me and saji when i refused her help koneko chan shook her head thats no good this is a team battle lets work together yeah its just as you say koneko chan but while he was fighting against me saji didnt make any direct attacks on koneko chan if he wanted to he could have attached the line to koneko chan and sucked up your power why do you think he didnt do that even so koneko chan couldnt answer my question but saji answered it while giving a complacent smile sorry toujou koneko
chan i want to win against hyoudou against the sekiryuutei one onone didnt i tell you our dream is serious we will build a school we will construct a school without discrimination in the underworld and i will become a teacherthat is my dreamthis battle is being broadcasted across the entire underworld thats why this has meaning i a pawn will win against the same pawn sekiryuutei hyoudou issei i will defeat the sekiryuutei ill win an d say it boldly that i will become a teacher saji was serious his gaze was strong and had neither shadow nor gloom anywhere in it i also spoke to koneko chan and thats how it is if i just run away from his challenge id be uncool right if i don t do it thats why i have to do it because im his friend i have no choice but to fight him seriously i have to do it otherwise i wont be able to show my face to buchou yes we were similar from head to toe we were similar were both unskil led idiots after hearing that koneko chan put away her fist and got some distance away from us
thank you me and saji thanked koneko chan at the same time but why did saji connect a line to not only my sacred gear but also me directly on my right arm he wants to prevent your sacred gears doubling ability from being restored and then flowing into him at the same time as he sucks away your own power he knows that if he sucks away both your own power and the sacred gears power at the same time his body wont be able to take it and will blow up he plans to stop the balance breaker countdown and return you to your normal form instead what a complex sacred gear this is going nowhere huh as saji sighed he gathered a mass of magic power un like anything until now between his hands what size it will affect the entire surroundings as i felt that that magic power was compressed and shrunk then a magic bullet the size of a softball was created between sajis hands with this it wont aff ect the surrounding area and it will completely destroy just your body having made that saji was already breathing heavily an attack filled with all
his might that was what he had created he intended to kill me with that saji smiled a bit i was j ealous of you the pride of your master and senpai the sekiryuutei everyone knows about you but even though im the same pawn as you i have nothing nothing thats why i obtained pride and selfconfidence i will kill you the sekiryuutei that was sajis yell i didnt know to think that he saw me like that but i will overcome your dream i had my own buchou had her own dream for the sake of fulfilling we will risk our lives together tooon saji finally shot the attack filled with all hi s might i tried to avoid it but saji released the line that was attached to my boosted gear on his end and then fired it towards my foot my boosted gear and the floor at my feet were tied to each other by the line i tried to pull it off but the line was too firm and hard and i couldnt get the booster gear free from the floor this is bad at this rate i wont be able to avoid the approaching
magic bullet balance breaker would activate in just a little more but it still wouldnt be in time i had no choice but to resolve myself the magic bullet hit me doooooooooooooooooooooooooon the moment it hit the magic bullet burst open and its aura spread throughout the surroundings at that instant divide a white gauntlet appeared on my right arm an d caught sajis attack i received half of the damage but the other half was annihilated by the hakuryuukous power my body couldnt endure anymorebut i wont receive any more damage my magic bullet was halved saji was shocked i was able to tentatively activate this power during my seclusion in the mountains but it has several conditions first the chances of activating it are less than ten percent this is close to a gamble second this also requires resolution its my life force rega rdless of whether the activation succeeds or fails my lifeforce is shaved off when i try to use it its a pretty scary gamble isnt it my gamble had succeeded but my life force was shaved off with its duty complete the white gauntlet immediately d isappeared from my right arm i can still
use it but i was unable to keep it materialised however thanks to that its complete the boosted gears countdown was finished im also risking my life i cant stop at a place like this lets gooooooooo s hine boosted geaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar in response to my cry my sacred gears voice rang out welsh dragon balance breaker a dazzling red and extra large aura surrounded me and changed into armour at the same time overflowing power welled up insid e me about ten minutes had passed since the game began i was wearing the boosted gear scale mail waltz it had been several minutes since the game had begun i kiba and xenovia entered the multi storey parking lot we advanced forward whi le cautiously looking through the dimly lit parking lot because we had both encountered a lot of spies in our missions moving forward like this was our strong point i walked in front and then after i confirmed that there was no one hiding under cover ahead of us i called back to xenovia behind me for her to move forward as well we repeated this many times and gradually advanced through the parking lot the plan was
to descend down the car passages on the second floor and go down to the first floor t he elevator was also functioning but we feared being attacked while we rode it down we had no choice but to advance with the most reliable method we advanced down the passage from the second floor and set foot on the first floor of the parking lot there was a silhouette before us looking closely it was a glasses wearing girl with long black hair i knew her kaichous queen the vice president of the student council shinra tsubaki senpai she held a naginata28 in her hand thats right i had heard that she was a naginata user and she held a considerably high rank with it as well how do you do kiba yuuto kun xenovia san i knew th at you would come here shinra senpai spoke indifferently there were two girls at her side a girl with a tall figure and a slender girl carrying a japanese sword the tall girl was called yura san a rook the girl holding the japanese sword was call ed meguri san a knight yura san excelled in hand tohand combat techniques while
meguri san was a member of a clan that made their living on the extermination of evil spirits i see so you stationed three people at the parking lot sona kaichou she read us well she had secured this place she predicted that we would be the ones most likely to attack xenovia unsheathed the sword that she carried on her back and i also produced a holy demonic sword in my hand xenovia didnt use durandal with that s pecial rule she wouldnt be able to act well with durandal since its power couldnt be controlled it would recklessly destroy the building rias gremory samas bishop retires the defeat of one of our comrades was heard from the announcement it was difficult to think that it was asia san i didnt understood how it happened but gasper had likely been taken out how calm you are shinra senpai said that yes since i wont be able to endure if i dont get used to something like this i respo nded extremely calmly inside though my heart was seething because even i felt the frustration and regret in losing a friend gasper kun most likely he was taken out before
he could display his power ill swing my sword for your share as well geez its because he didnt train his body enough beside me xenovia sighed as well she was also calm or so it seemed but her eyes were still but even so they took out my cute kouhai ill have to avenge him dreadful pressure was being given off from her the pressure was even transmitted to me her ally shes surprisingly soft towards her friends as well despite appearances she also felt that gasper kun was cute being notified of his defeat was unforgivable to her together we prepared our specia l weapons and while shortening the distance between us and our opponents we sprang forward giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin me and shinra senpai and xenovia and meguri san crossed swords sparks flashed from the force of the blades clashing and intense clangs rang out at that instant meguri san noticed what xenovia held in her hand and took a step back a holy sword she let out a voice of surprise yes xenovia was holding a holy sword moreover it was a legendary one yeah this is ascalon ise kun lo aned it to me azazel sensei had
noticed ascalon which was assimilated into the boosted gear ise cant you remove it due to these words the fact that ascalon could be detached from the sacred gear was uncovered sensei had then hurriedly hande d xenovia a training plan to get accustomed to ascalon it seemed that she had practiced handling ascalon while training outside as both dragon slaying powers and the sekiryuuteis power were now imbued in ascalon it had changed into a specialised weapon that boasts enormous power it may not match durandals destructive power but when taking into account its ease of use it had a wider range of uses than durandal however that meant that ise kun didnt have ascalon at present that shouldnt backfire o n us this time but after that me and xenovia entered an intense slashing battle with our opponents we made sure to avoid each other but it was the other person on the opponents side the rook yura san that i was concerned about depending on her m ovements we would know whether she regarded either of us as dangerous and was aiming at either me or xenovia while remaining vigilant of yura san i continued firing my
holy demonic sword at the vice president my and xenovias swords emitted a holy wave if we landed a blow on our opponents big damage would be definite if that happened they would have to retire as healing techniques were restricted a single stroke of the sword if they suffered a single stroke of our swords it would become our vict ory as she switched between offence and defence xenovia suddenly made a hole in space normally anyone would think that she would materialise durandal here but that wasnt it a holy aura drifted out from the tear in space and wrapped itself around th e ascalon that xenovia held while keeping durandal locked up in the space youre taking out only its holy aura shinra senpai was shocked as she understood xenovia smiled yeah i was suggested an interesting way to use durandal i somehow manage d to achieve it in my training now i can use it more than sufficiently buchou and azazel sensei had also highly regarded xenovias durandal at the same time they felt that it was wasteful that she couldnt control the sword durandal was a holy sword that boasted a tremendous sharpness therefore when
its owner couldnt control it it became an assassins blade in reality xenovia used durandal but it was also a fact that she was also considerably tossed about by its destructive power she may beco me able to control it eventually however until then it was also dangerous to simply swing such an assassins blade recklessly therefore sensei had an idea can you not release only durandals aura from the separate space you could then clad it on asc alon or a holy sword that kiba creates i was also wonderstruck by such an amazing idea of using ascalon and my swords like this durandal was simply kept in that space and it continuously emitted its mighty holy aura only the aura was taken out from the separate space and the power was poured onto other swords it wasnt durandal itself but a power equal to its own was limitlessly poured onto a different sword thatwas the new power of the ascalon that xenovia held in her hands the fallen angel govern or azazel he had showed all these possibilities to us such a fallen angel had been our enemy i was delighted that he was now on our side
xenovia attacked her opponent with ascalon durandals aura giin giiiiiiiin silver light and sparks flashed in the darkness of the parking lot the skill and sword possessed by the knight meguri san were quite special but she was gradually being cornered by xenovias speed and power take this not overlooking an instant of opening xenovia instantly cornered her opponent she had got her but there was someone who stepped into the space between them the rook yura san as she put out both of her hands in front of her reversalreverse xenovia let out her attack but the holy aura had disappeared and changed into a demonic aura xenovias slash became an attack trapped by momentum and in that moment her sword was caught by yura san and flicked away yura san tried to pursue her in that state but xenovia r egained her balance and avoided her kick gasshaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan the kick blew away several cars with its force a direct hit would be dangerous i had become speechless from the phenomenon just now a holy aura become a demonic aura yura san h ad called out reverse in other words she transformed a holy aura into a demonic aura
was that yura sans ability or a sacred gear i didnt understand the reason for it but this was troublesome it was a kind of those so called counters its a spec ial case but it would be bad if that counter was used while yura san and meguri san worked together ascalons holy power was reversed and turned into demonic power only ordinary damage would be given to a devil from demonic power since a devils origin was from demonic magic it became just an ordinary slash xenovia also possesses incredible skills but her battling would be disturbed because she had trained and fought based on holy swords if she received a counter even xenovia would fall well done sitri group if its like this xenovia switch with me by my shout me and xenovia switched places and exchanged our respective opponents this was fine with my holy demonic swords the effect of their reverse would have no meaning because there was nothing to reverse when the power of holy and demonic were blended together yura san also didnt display her reverse stance and she started to attack me along with meguri san next to us xenovia and shinra
senpai had started slashing at each othe r xenovias furious attacks were intense and at last she managed to corner shinra senpai in front of a wall she had her xenovia decide it instantly like that as if my thoughts were transmitted to her xenovia raised ascalon and entered a posture for the finishing strike she can do it if we take out the queen the whole situation will become considerably easier with this this match is decided as xenovia swung down the sword at shinra senpai and dealt a direct hit at that instant sacred gear mirror of recollectionmirror alice a huge ornamented mirror appeared in front of shinra senpai xenovias slash continued without stopping and crushed the mirror zuooooooooooooooooon a wave was released from the broken mirror and attacked xenovia with a bewildered expression on her face xenovia spurted out blood all over the place when this mirror is destroyed the impact on it is doubled and returned to the opponent i am a counter user k iba yuuto kun it was a mistake to send the power type xenovia san against me shinra senpai gave a sneer gahah lying on the road surface xenovia coughed out blood
from her mouth in apparent pain they got us her ability was different from what i h ad heard had she accomplished change and growth and attained a new ability the only one remaining is kiba yuuto youre the only one left the three of them approached me i picked up xenovia and then swiftly hid myself within the shadows nearby i placed xenovia in the shadow of a car and took out the medical supplies we had gotten at the drugstore a short while before we had completely lost just now that she would station two counter users here it seemed that sona kaichou intended to completely cr ush us first so she had naturally predicted that we would be the likely attackers certainly they were a threat to just us who were quick on our feet and users of holy swords kaichou had supplemented for their respective weaknesses by having them team u p against us and spurred us to use power had she predicted everything to this point xenovia was in serious condition she had received double the power of durandal and ascalon if shinra senpais sacred gear was a type that countered holy attacks perfe ctly
it would be an instant retire for us if it was handled poorly xenovia could have died with these injuries her withdrawal from the battlefield wont be long now shell completely retire with the next attack buchou was the one who had the phoeni x tears we couldnt use healing techniques here either xenovia grasped my hand as i treated her and spoke abandon me kiba ill disappear from this place anyway when i retire soon because of these injuries but i took my hand away from hers and con tinued treating her yeah i know that but you know i promised that i wouldnt abandon an ally so easily how soft youre just like ise i gave a smile at those words that makes me happy because part of me also thinks that id like to become li ke him thats right i wanted a spirit that would never give up like ise kun he was amazing even though he knows that hes weak he still confronts the enemy he belittles himself but in fact he understands himself more than anyone else and works har d most likely i wouldnt be a match for him anymore in terms of
simply physical strength his efforts and guts entered into the territory of deserving admiration advancing step by step with effort his progress was nobler than anyone else become like ise you mean become a pervert that is ise kuns thing i want to obtain his guts and willpower at those words xenovia let out a strained laugh that doesnt suit you best though i also thought that true but as long as i can move even a sin gle finger i wont fall i see are you telling someone like me to move since i can still move a single finger what a cruel guy if i fall down ill do what i have to do even if i can move only a single millimetre or inch because otherwise the re gret of not doing anything would be so painful that id die sona sitri samas pawn retires an announcement it seemed that someone had taken out one of the opponents we also had to hold on the sound on the enemies footsteps approached xenovia youll retire from here soon but before that i think that ill show it to you i appeared in front of the three opponents have
you resolved yourself preparing to use her naginata shinra senpai approached a small tear in space appeared behind me xe novia was making it form it couldnt be seen like this as it was in the enemies blind spot then durandals aura flowed into me now then xenovia ill show it to you this technique created by you and me rias gremorys two knights zazazazan holy demonic swords sprang up everywhere within this parking lot the holy demonic aura that covered them might have been little but if durandals aura is also added to them its another story entirely durandal birth that attack pierced through yura san and meguri san just as they began to shine they disappeared from this place two down shinra senpai seemed to have escaped and left the parking lot in my arms xenovias body began to shine kiba that was a nice attack her expression was covered with a smile as she was disappearing from here so i also smiled and saw her off yeah when you and i work together again we can make more holy swords bloom her weight had disappeared and then she herself disappeared as well pariiiiiiin after making a short
lived noise the holy swords that had bloomed all over the place crumbled and dissolved into nothingness life5 buchou vs kaichou second half part 1 several minutes after i started to fight with saji he and i were still exchanging punches with each other no matter how you looked at it i had the advantage saji was already ragged he was defending himself by using a bundled up line on his arm as a shield but he couldnt offset every attack sometimes he was knocked off his feet t o the point that he crashed into the store behind him our hand tohand fighting was mostly equal however my offensive and defensive point was rising to the point where we couldnt even be compared i still hadnt reached my true power but i knocked hi m down many times even so he still stood up even though his legs were trembling as he did so he was throwing punches at my armour sajis fists were already broken i could hear his fists wounds snapping and they were covered with blood though saji had fired his line at me the aura of the sekiryuutei blew it off and didnt allow it
to connect itself to me however the line that had been connected to my right arm when he first arrived wouldnt come off even when i transformed into armour and no mat ter how many times i tried to blow it off with my aura it wouldnt go away just where the heck was it connected to maybe the ascalon i had lent to xenovia could cut it off but there was no point in saying that now ill have to cut it off when we join up later there was something else strange as well though my armour should be firm every time saji managed to hit me my mind and body shook and resounded it was gradually becoming distinct and the pain i was receiving told me that i was surely swellin g up beneath my armour i was also certainly receiving damage ill wintoday ill defeat youill take the first step towards my dream what was this person before me while spitting out bloody vomit what was he at that time i recalled in my mind the words that tannin ossan had said to me during training kid listen carefully the most fearful attack is a heavy
blow29 a heavy blow yeah the rating games that youll be fighting in from now on will have various people fighting with various feelings for the sake of ones desire for the sake of a hobby for the sake of ones family for the sake of a woman for the sake of wealth and for the sake of a dream various thoughts and feelings mix together among these there are even people who have invested their lives into the games among the participants in this hellish iron pot there is an attack that must be feared the most that is the heavy blow is that a special final move or a sacred gear a magic technique no kid grasp your fist what is being grasped inside your hand there i dont know it is filled with something a dream or a soul ones life is put into that fist this is above all dangerous if one has time to prepare other attacks this blow can be dealt with to a certain extent one way or another but just that is not enough the heavy blow reaches to the core of the body this is effective it is frighteningly effective even
in the underworld with its magic and science the damage of that blow cant be expressed clearly but the ones who had been hit with this blow understand yeah this is bad they think an opponent that can release thi s blow is an unmistakably genuine strong enemy you must never go easy against them if an opponent can release that blow even if he is of a lower level than you that is a different story if you receive that blow the battle situation will change comple tely it pierces you no matter what defence you use against it it will reach the core of your body i understand now ossan sajis blows were piercing me they were passing through my armour and reaching my body this spirit is the prison dragon th at sleeps in his sacred gear responding to sajis feelings dragon type sacred gears are scary ddraig i couldnt understand what was happening hyoudoooooooooooooooou even if his mind and body was tormented by the cruel reality saji didnt stopping punching i also responded in kind and a battle of blows began let me ask you one thing what is it like are your masters breasts soft
is the rumour about them feeling like marshmallows true is a womans body seriously like pudding that doesnt c ollapse i was struck by the eyes of saji that was burning with jealously and envy seizing this opportunity he fired the line connected it to a bench behind me and swung it with all his strength but i crossed my arms and protected myself the bench b roke into small pieces and scattered on the floor that was equal to the damage i didnt receive just now what were you thinking when you were rubbing her breasts damn iiiiiiiiiiiiit wasnt this somehow more intense than the blows when he was talking about his dream then he extended several lines to the furniture store and hauled out a ton of large furniture from there and drew an arc through the air with them as he brought them right above my head so he intends to bring them all down on me like that gunn as all the large furniture fell down i fired a dragon shot that i restrained to the minimum at the sky the adjustment of power was too difficult i couldnt fire ones like this many times doooon
the wave blast of red magic power instantly erased the large furniture but dogoh my back was hit by an impact when i looked back saji had changed the trajectory of a single line and knocked a dresser into me it didnt give me any particularly great damage but the impact was transmitted to my whole body even if there wasnt any damage this kind of impact was bad for my body if i kept getting hit like this it seems like adverse effects will start to pop up i also want to rub them i want to rub theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem buwah saji was final ly letting out tears of frustration i havent even seen breasts yet you dont know how much ive prayed for nipples my entire life and yet you get to see them as much as you liiiiiiiiiiiiike gonn i knocked saji down but he stood up immediately dam n it what fighting spirit he has but hyoudou it isnt breasts that i want the most its to be a teacher a teacher i will become a teacher cant i become a teacher why do we have to be laughed at and then saji cried out at me
no it was to th e many people watching this we didnt declare our dream for the sake of being laughed at im not laughing its impossible to be able to laugh at you when youre risking your life like this facing him i hit saji it wasnt enough so i hit him ag ain sajis face quickly started swelling up and he spit out broken teeth and blood from his mouth even so saji stood back up and faced me again and again he was that foolishly honest today i will surpass you sajis shout heavily resounded all the way through my armour and to my heart with a bang after that i pounded tens of blows into him hyuhhyuh before i realised the sounds of breath coming from sajis mouth began to sound faint he should be at his limit already since he had multipl e cuts in his mouth now the blood wouldnt stop flowing out from his lips he was already at the point where he couldnt even speak his face was swollen and his left eye was completely shut his body was shaking and his stance was also unsteady some of his fingers were bent
in the wrong direction as well even so even so saji faced me with only a strong glint in his eyes come saji come sajiiiiiiiiiiiii you wont let it end here right you dont intend to let it end like this right werent you going to do the things that arent possible for idiots like us and run swiftly forward he slowly moved forward step by step saji didnt run away saji faced forward without shifting his gaze even an inch away from me he advanced straight forward his appearance right now was similar to mine in the house of phoenix battle i had also seen myself then in the recorded video though i had been worn out i moved forward in order to absolutely approach my opponent you also trained desperately right i trained desperately as well i could feel a dreadful pressure from saji though i should clearly surpass him i was seized with a terrible fear even if i hit and hit he wouldnt fall for there to be an opponent that i feel such great fear against hey riser phoenix you also felt like that when facing me didnt you i understand it now the reason
why you kept knocking me down saji im going to beat you saji made a punch at me with his bent hand it extended forward with seemingly slow spee d but i avoided it with the smallest movements there i exchanged a counter punch against him dagan my punch perfectly hit sajis face i also felt good feedback from it it was a blow that completely cut off his consciousness even so even so s aji grasped my right arm with both his hands so strongly that he wouldnt let go saji had lost consciousness but his hands wouldnt let go of my right arm then he kept holding onto my right arm his body was wrapped in light icouldnt take my eyes o ff from saji until he disappeared because i felt that if i looked away he may revive himself again sona sitri samas pawn retires koneko chan i stowed away my armours mask on my helmet and showed my face could you hold my hand senpai i spoke with a forced smile this is the first time i knocked down a friend i understand it i understand it but koneko chan gently grasped my trembling fist while
smiling i could feel it even through my gauntlet you were cool a senpai to be proud of those words were enough to reach me part 2 with my match against saji over i broke open the door of a nearby vending machine and gulped down a water bottle from inside koneko chan also quenched her thirst damn it i couldnt get rid of my bodys s hakiness was it an effect of wearing the armour certainly i had received a lot of damage in the battle against saji but it wasnt to the extent that i couldnt fight according to an announcement a short while ago it seemed that one of our knights h ad been taken out was it kiba or xenovia i didnt know which one it was whichever of them survived likely wasnt critically wounded the opponents side had also lost one knight and rook apiece our side had six people left the other side had four those were numbers we still couldnt be careless against i also had less than 20 minutes left to remain in this state we have to settle this quickly ise senpai koneko chan pointed at my right arm thats right
even though saji had disappeared th e line attached to my right arm hadnt even when i activated my armour only this line hadnt disappeared this line definitely connected over to the sitri base what was this for it didnt seem to be a very good thing but since it hadnt disappeared al ong with saji he must have put a lot of thought and feelings into thissaji what on earth did you put into this at that time we were contacted through our communication devices offence team can you hear were now advancing towards the enemy base as well a communication from buchou i see so buchou had finally started to move as well the opening and middle stages were over and we were heading to the last spurt all at once after taking a big breath i spoke to koneko chan lets go koneko chan nodded and we proceeded towards the final decisive battle there was a place that looked like a central plaza in the centre of the shopping mall surrounded by a circular bench there was a clock pillar in the centre of it shoppers that got tired with shopping frequently sat down there once we
had advanced that far i stopped walking naturally since sona kaichou was right there before me how do you do hyoudou issei kun toujou koneko san i see so thats the appearance of the sekiryuutei i do feel a terrible wave of power from you its only natural for everyone to consider it dangerous she spoke in a calm and composed tone kaichou was surrounded by a barrier the ones generating the barrier were the two bishop members of the student counc il and the line that was attached to my right arm was connected to one of the bishops it couldnt be was their plan to channel my power through the bishop and into the barrier it was bad if the power of the sekiryuutei was being poured into it if kiba or xenovia joined up with us we could just cut through it with a holy sword soon the vice president of the student council shinra senpai appeared this girl was also beautiful moreover she had a surprisingly glamorous body running after her ki ba appeared from the opposite direction from which we had come from so the one that was taken out was xenovia huh sona youre
quite bold to have come right to the centre buchous voice when i looked back i saw that buchou had also arrived here havent you yourself the king also moved personally as well rias yeah since weve already reached the final stage either way though it seems to have turned out quite differently from what i expected buchou wore a rigid expression certainly the plans goal was for kiba and xenovia to take down kaichou i was supposed to be the bait for the sake of that butshe seemed to have completely read us was kaichou one step higher than us no i believed in buchou suddenly my consciousness becam e distanta rea rere i staggered in placea rere the muddiness of my mind was becoming stronger little by little finally i fell to my knees where i stood ise buchou noticed the change in me and asia activated her healing sacred gear over me wh ile giving off a pale green colour it wrapped my body with a gentle light the pain disappeared but the distantness of my consciousness didnt go away buchou tried taking out the phoenix tears but stopped she judged that if something couldnt be completely
cured by asias sacred gear the tears would also have little effect all the other group members had noticed the change in me and became bewildered among them only kaichou was giving a small smile neither asia sans sacred gear nor the pho enix tears will have any effect rias i saw the video records of how the battle with riser was finished what i understood from that was that hyoudou kun is a boy that wont give up in battle to the point of being frightening for the sake of his comrad es for himself and above all for rias kaichou continued further we may not be able to defeat him with just damage no matter how many times we knock him down hell just get back up to us your so called guts and spirit is just as astounding as th e power of the sekiryuutei yes if you dont give up and keep on standing up you believe that youll eventually defeat your enemy that willpower connects directly to the power of the sekiryuutei and increases your power by several times as well that is the greatest weapon for hyoudou kun tthats because guts and spirit are
my only redeeming feature thats why we had no choice but to beat you with a different method from a bag that was being held by one of the bishops a pack was taken out the i nterior of the pack was red like blood the line was connected to the pack and it couldnt be inside the pack waskaichou confirmed the contents of the pack its your blood you are a reincarnated devil that is a human at your base its lethal if a h uman loses half of the blood coursing through their body you know that right the rule of the rating game when a devil reaches the point of being unable to fight during the game they are forcibly transported to the medical room saji you this is what you were aiming for from the beginning gakun i suddenly lost all strength in my body hyuh kiba threw a holy demonic dagger and cut off the line that was connected to me but red blood rushed out from the cut line onto t he floor ah so my blood was drawn out through the line its too late youve already lost enough blood to be transported
to the medical room those were kaichous cold words sona you buchou ran up to me her expression was wrapped in impatience buchou and us had been completely outsmarted thats right i used sajis sacred gear to suck out hyoudou kuns blood little by little until he entered a dangerous state in order to continuously use a sacred gear whose original ability is to suck ou t the energy of the target to suck out their blood instead considerable training and precise control was necessary but saji managed to accomplish it so he kept hitting me even while in that state not only because of his guts and spirit but also to s tall for time since he could only suck out my blood little by little he sacrificed his own body back then in order to buy more time he could have stalled for time just by running away from me but he confronted me face to face instead saji you so everything was for the sake of beating me face to face hyoudou kun you are close to retiring you should only be able to do one or two attacks now the reason is blood loss your armour
is solid your offensive power is great however when i searched fo r ways to defeat you there were many even if we cant physically defeat you the game rules will consider you unable to fight ididnt have the strength left to stand up anymore i had completely lost so there was such a methodso kaichous plans were superior to ours kaichou questioned buchou rias what are you willing to bet on this battle im willing to risk my life my dream is a very difficult one if i dont destroy the obstacles one by one i cant cut open a path of solution kaichou spok e to buchou from right in front of her rias i will destroy your pride and estimation at kaichous words buchou had a sour expression as if she had eaten a bitter bug she must have been completely mortified certainly buchou had had the advantage in this battle the advantage had seemed so great that it was only natural for us to win while in that situation this had happened if buchou was simply defeated by an enemy who had taken measures against her her estimation would lower accordingly kaicho u had also aimed
at that sona sitri just how far did you calculate things kaichous gaze shifted to me saji he was always saying that he would surpass you to saji you are a fellow pawn a friend and a rival he wants to surpass i was satisf ied with kaichous words sajis fighting spirit and aspirations when facing me those had clearly been of high density hewas aiming for me from the start huh however you have a legendary dragon inside you with just that he possessed an inferiority complex towards you i wanted to convey to that child that he could fight while crying over such a thing and that was conveyed to him the line didnt disappear even when saji was worn out he filled it with that much intense feelings ill say this to y ou who is about to disappear from this battlefield soon just as you were aiming only for the top saji was running towards the objective of defeating you you arent the only pawn that has a dream and lives earnestly the one who beat you was saji gens hirou today i will surpass you i recalled sajis words in my mind saji so youtrained
for the sake of defeating me damn it saji saji youre amazing even when i kept hitting and hitting you you only thought of beating me even if you couldn t beat me directly you believed that your comrades could beat me if you left just a scratch but you didnt need to worry it seems i was sunk by just your attack however i dont want to disappear without showing my new special technique i mustered the last of my power and stood up i stepped just a little distance away i stood in a place where everyone present both gremory and sitri were caught if im going to fall i want to fall down after doing some naughtiness i placed both hands in front o f me and set my sights on buchous breasts before i retirei think ill disappear after ive fulfilled my worldly desires thats right i was going to disappear either way in that case i might as well reveal everything i have in my last moments and t hen leave i poured all the power left inside me into my brain flash my delusions the last of my aura wrapped around my entire body
it wasnt concentrated into power it was concentrated into my head rise my lust unleash my worldly desires using the power of the sekiryuutei i aimed at a greater height once again hold on a little longer my body i will surpass the me of just before this will be an unrivalled technique depending on how its used spread out the world of my dreams instantly a mysterious space expanded and unfolded with me at the centre feeling it on their skin the females of both the gremory and sitri groups protected and covered their bodies however please be relieved my new special technique doesnt deal direct damage its flashiness couldnt be compared to that of dress break then i cast a voice on buchou on buchous breasts please let me hear your voice ise are you okay if you do such a strange thing itll affect your health i heard a cute sounding voice from her breasts i see i see fufufufu i can hear it i can hear it excellent buchou youre worried about me right now arent you that ill hurt my body by doing something strange at my words buchou had an astonished expression on her
face ise h how do you know that i then questioned kaichous kaichous breasts what are you thinking about right now could he have developed a technique to hear the voice of peoples hearts sona thats troubling i see so sona kaichous breasts arri ved at that conclusion the character of the breasts werent always the same as their owners buchous breasts sounded like a little girl kaichous breasts sounded similar to her older sister serafall leviathan sona kaichou you thought that my new spe cial technique could let me hear the voices of peoples hearts right kaichou was seriously surprised by my confession fufufu thats not it its close but thats not it i wanted to hear it the voice of chests no the voice of breasts taking a p ose i magnificently called out the name of my new special technique my new technique breast translationpailingual my new technique lets me hear the voice of breasts from women only haa haa when i question them the breasts tell the answer to only me without lies haa haa its the strongest technique that lets me understand the heart of the opponent ugh i dont have enough blood i had
decided i had already decided i may die while dizzy be cause i had nowhere near enough blood but i was satisfied the voices only i could hear i wanted to hear them when i was secluded on the mountain my sexual desire was also refused as a result i longed for breasts to the point of feeling overwhelmed i want to see them but there werent even any porno books on the mountain of course there werent any women there either just a huge dragon every single day while living a survival lifestyle i was chased by the dragon what happened to me a moder nday child in a sensitive period of his life by going to such an environment starting from wanting to talk and meet with girls the end result was i groped for something close to an erotic state of mind i knew of famous priests who had secluded themsel ves on mountains for training and pursued the state of mind that opened up enlightenment they faced a state that abandoned worldly desires but then what happened when i did the reverse and entered training while only pursuing worldly desires my heart arrived at searching for
erotic things and their source nights on the mountain while wrapping myself in big leaves i looked at the sky and endlessly thought of breasts i also sometimes sat in zen mediation stance i even sat under a waterfall in a natu ral state my head filled with only worldly desires i want to rub them touch them inhale them poke them go between them after thinking of various things for many days i suddenly came to a realisation i want to talk with breasts when i realised my deep gratitude and blessings toward breasts i wanted to talk with breasts what did breasts think and say i wanted to know at that time i couldnt reach those thoughts and feelings with my lack of power but with the power of the sekiryuutei the poss ibilities multiplied and at last i have completed it hey breasts of the bishop onee san over there what are you thinking no dont listen the bishop onee san felt danger to her body and covered her breasts but too slow kiba kyun im so ha ppy to be standing on the same battlefield as kiba kyun whats with that its only kiba thats popular
the breasts of the other bishop onee san what are you thinking with just the turn of my gaze towards her the opponent crouched down with her head between her knees please stop it its disgusting hyoudou is scaryeven though he has such a strong looking armour why can i only see him as an ordinary pervert as a result of those two in a row i collapsed where i stood uu so my body w as also at its limits damn it so there were also things that shouldnt be heard so it was like that when i suddenly looked around everyones eyes were twitching are hey why werent you all surprised at this strongest technique of mine kaichous e yes twitched and buchou put a hand to her forehead and sighed riasthis is a little im sorry i think its a scary technique but with this violation of privacy wont female devils no longer fight him from now on yeah well have to be severel y careful now arerere what was with these reactions i think its definitely a useful ability rather like this its as if im a true pervert you are a pervert i received a
full blown tsukkomi from both the gremory and sitri sides iwas speechless impossiblei just heard the voice of everyones breasts in my ear look this technique was perfect see asias breasts what are you thinking right now stupid ise how can you do such a thing while injured b but ill definitely cure you ah what a thing so asias breasts were tsundere30 so the breasts expressed what the target was thinking like this even though you were cool beforelewd sekiryuutei the worst au koneko chans scathing words ugh its no good my dizzy consciousness was at its limit i didnt have enough blood alright then ill at least read kaichous strategy at the end kaichous breasts san please tell me what kind of strategy you intend to use now this special barrier made by the two bishops is a decoy only my spirit has been placed in the barrier and my body is just a holographic image since my spirit has come here its possib le to make the presence of my body disappear and to make it look like my aura is inside the barrier my true body is on the roof its a strategy to make you
attack the me inside the barrier and weaken you guys even a little i see i see so that is j ust an image but only her spirit had come here in any case i told everyone about what kaichous breasts had said everyone the kaichou in that barrieris a decoy shes just a holographic image created by the two bishops inside the barriertheir st rategy is to make us wastefully attack the barrier here and weaken us even a littlethe real kaichou is on the roof it seems that only her spirit has been moved into the hologramthats also why koneko chans enemy detection couldnt find the kaichou on t he roof but because her spirit came here pailingual also worked and let me hear the holographic breasts is that it after communicating just that i collapsed isesan asia tried running over to me but kaichous queen didnt let her go to me asia then struck a pose of prayer where she was and her body began to shine faintly trying to spread out to her surroundings was this the area expansion of asias healing ability this was the fruits of her training she should have understood that heali
ng would not have any effect on me at this point even so her natural gentleness made her worry for me asia you really are a good kid with tsundere breasts as well youre unmatched i was waiting for that one of the bishops undid kaichous hologr aphic image both the barrier and kaichous hologram disappeared but without paying any heed to that the opposing bishop set foot into asias healing area reverse don the pale green light changed instantly and emitted something red and dangerous i nstead ah in that instant asias body shined and was disappearing the reverse of healing is damageargento sans healing ability is immenseif that is reversed the opposing bishop that had entered asias healing area had a satisfied looking expression on her face even as she vomited blood what what had happened i beat the gremorys healerkaichou kaichous bishop then disappeared at the same time as asia damn it they took out asiai i too my body was wrapped in light i was alr eady done fori wanted to promote to queen by entering the enemys baseto lose without even doing thatwas pitiful but i was satisfied with being able to use pailingual saji
i rias gremory samas bishop retires sona sitri samas bishop retires rias gremory samas pawn retires vip iazazel laughed inside the vip room so this is the current sekiryuutei one of the spectating leaders murmured that the vip room had become opened mouthed naturally since a new stupid technique had been displayed on the monitor as they all watched as if devouring it pailingual it was just way too dumb even i being open minded to perverted things couldnt understand at all what had happened in that moment since even i was like this the mi nds of the others must be in quite a terrible state indeed on the monitor rias was blushing deeply i sympathised with her but dear me this was interesting however this pailingual it had no flashiness but in reality it was a fearful technique if the opponent was female the state of the battle would likely be overturned because it exposed the inside of their hearts there was no other technique as terrifying as this to an opponent moreover it could read the inside of their hearts even in the ty pe of situation where the spirit was being projected as a holographic image
in matches limited to female opponents he would be unparalleled with that technique he keeps rapidly developing techniques that make him hated by women does he really intend to become popular its regrettable that the person himself doesnt seem to completely understand how amazing this technique is since it occurred to him at the top of his sexual desire but rather hell be told by rias that hes banned from using it in the games as it is now he wont be able to participate in games with other devils since many devils own female devil servants vali i also understand why you who are of an exceptionally higher rank than ise took such an interest in the sekiryuutei who i s widely called the weakest of all the successive generations interesting he was described with that one word a guy who watches and fights without getting tired is the best opponent for a battle enthusiast hey vali ise is evolving and becoming stron g in a different way than you at that time what will you do how will you fight him hes a guy who goes far and in a slanted way above our expectations so much fun
i really was enjoying myself most likely it will be the greatest showdown between red and white out of all the previous generations besides that though there was the reverse used by the sitri group that was something researched by us we had started giving technical assistance to the devils but that reverse was still in the resear ch stage so someone like armaros or sahariel offered it to them on the condition of getting data on it during the game huh geez it was still at the research stage so it wouldnt be strange if anything happened and sona sitri and her servants used it while acknowledging that so their resolution their fighting spirit of wanting to win at any cost must have been stirred up huh there were also fallen angels who picked out sacred gears and embedded them into themselves but this reverse was similar in that it forcibly granted someone an ability they didnt originally have as an act that shortens ones life and destroys ones own abilities its dangerous ise also obtained the power of the hakuryuukou and shaved off his life even if this ability incr eases as an appendix to his own ability
like kiba there are also safe examples of this but as expected it couldnt really be recommended incidentally since my artificial sacred gear was made specifically for my use right from scratch it has no problem s sorry but im going to have to advise them that reverse should be banned from future games i also feel like i do not want to nip young buds in such a place however to think that they would use reverse like this originally it was created for th e sake of reversing contrary things that turned the holy into demonic and darkness into light to think that they would skilfully use reverse in accordance to their opponents abilities i ascertained with my own eyes the resolution of the sitri group th is time show me how far you guys can go in any case how will the others act now that ise has been lost i knew that previously you would get discouraged by such a thing rias akeno hohohoh what an interesting battle the damn old geezer odin watch ed the monitor in seeming satisfaction for that selfish geezer to give praise odin spoke to sirzechs sirzechs yes about that kid
who has the dragon sacred gear you mean hyoudou issei kun he has the sekiryuutei however odins next words wer e unexpected no i mean the pawn of the sitri family i see so he paid attention to that one odin continued speaking what a good devil you should take good care of that one hell become strong the achievement of beating the sekiryuutei kid is huge watching the rating games of devils is fun because of this the weak change in the middle of a match this is what a true match is odin was paying the greatest of compliments to someone whose existence he didnt even know about several hours ago thats right thats right odin ojiichan really understands things after all serafall also praised her little sisters group and seemed cheery even though she had watched with tearfully crying face until just now that pawn of sona sitri she said his name was saji genshirou you could say that his estimation rose more than ise in this match this game had been broadcasted across the entire underworld unexpectedly the name of this previously unknown dragon sacred gear user may have become more famous than the sekiryuutei ise
rias this world that youre trying to plunge into has many difficulties in store for you all end game after ise kun and asia san disappeared from the battlefield there were only four of us left including me kiba yuuto my master rias buchou akeno san and koneko chan the enemy had three people l eft kaichou shinra senpai and the remaining bishop student council member wed lost half our members a game where one side was supposed to dominate was full of major upsets right from the beginning the side that was said to be superior had also lo st half of their members i could already hear the comments of those high class devils watching us from above buchous estimation will surely fall but we couldnt let it fall any lower than this ise the mood maker of our team had disappeared this wa shuge i somehow endured it but what was going on in buchous mind if asia were still here she would be in shock our current members wouldnt change for the moment even if there had been a shocking impact just now as long as it didnt affect the bat tle there was no problem
but asia had also been unexpectedly taken out the so called reverse which had been chosen to be used when she activated her healing ability and moreover her area expansion version so the opposite of healing was damage asi asans healing ability was enormous the damage caused by reverse must have also been unimaginable more importantly asia had exited in an instant the opposing bishop hanakai san had also disappeared from the attack she gave most likely they had pre dicted beforehand that the healing ability could be expanded and that it would be used and made tactics against it they must have also taken into consideration that asia sans area expanded healing would heal without distinguishing between enemies and al lies if reverse had been activated when more than one ally was being healedwe could have also been completely wiped out what terrifying tactics so you thought that far ahead sona kaichou however even so to have the intention of sacrificing her servantsi could feel that their power of unity was greater than ours because she believed in her members they could display such feats of strength on the other hand ises technique wasi couldnt say anything anymore but
if the opponents are limited to women it may become quite threateningwait this wasnt what i should be thinking about though sona kaichou hadnt aimed at winning with immense power but instead at using counters that made use of us who did possess immense power this was the origin al rating game you couldnt easily win with just power buchou stood up and looked above she must have been focusing on kaichou who was on the roof even though ise kun had been lost buchou was calm as expected of a king since if the king didnt function and act the game would be affected koneko can you feel her spirit buchou asked koneko chan this yes i couldnt detect it before but now i can sense kaichous spirit on the roof i think that the barrier from before was false illusion tha t made it look like kaichou was inside it and also a special decoy that made anyone unable to perceive the actual persons spirit and location her cat ears were moving timidly seemingly searching for kaichous spirit your cat ears are very cute konek ochan koneko chan was also a battle ready state even if ise kun
had disappeared i was thankful for this with this we can fight sufficiently i pointed my sword at shinra senpai and the other servant from the sitri group now then how shall we do th is as two blade users shall we decide it by the blade shinra senpai responded to my question that is also fine in chess when a pawn is promoted in most cases they become queen however the battle situation changes if they promote to knight in stead depending on the setting there are also a lot of differences between actual chess and the rating games but this will be a good match the battle between me and shinra senpai was decided besides her there was only the opposing bishop kusaka san but at that moment akeno entered my sight as she gave off a crackling golden aura from her entire body akeno sanhad a cold look in her tear soaked eyes and was giving off a strange aura even though i tried to show ise kun my determination she w ent forward a step on with wobbly and shaky legs i could feel a strong pressure in that step that couldnt be expressed in words
even though i tried to overcome itby using this hateful power in front of him akeno san slowly raised her hands in front of her and i wont forgive you she showed the natural face of her s side the number one state that akeno san shouldnt be touched in impossible to think that the usually calm akeno san would react to losing ise kun like this disappear after t hat brief anger filled declaration a great mass of thunder sprung forth from akeno sans hands and swooped down on the sitri bishop kusaka san doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon reverse at the instant of impact kusaka san sprea d out her hands and tried to reverse the thunder but bigagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagaga the violent thunder wrapped around kusaka san kusaka san couldnt reverse the thunder and directly received akeno sans attack and at the same time she was wrapped in light and disappeared it seems it was useless she tried to reverse the thunder but what i shot just now was lightning thunder and light the reverse of the light portion wasnt enough to reverse it all sona sitri samas bishop reti res the power couldnt be overturned when the power being reversed was changed
just as akeno san said it seemed that their training wasnt enough for them to master the power of reverse akeno san then pointed her hands at the queen shinra senpa i akeno san had already disregarded the battle between me and senpai she had forgotten me in her shock over losing ise kun and her anger at not being able to display her lightning power to him it may be that as a result of that akeno san was able to c onquer that power but what an unexpected development to think that ise kun meant that much to akeno san kuh shinra senpai felt the danger to her body and started running away from here kah dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon the lightning extended str aight towards senpai if a devil was hit directly by that they would be helpless since it was mixed with the power of thunder and the power of light the weakness of devils just imagining getting hit by that power was terrifying however shinra senpai avoided the lightning and tried to escape into the interior of the department store i swiftly ran after her i wont lose when it comes to speed while dashing i created a
holy demonic sword and when i caught up i stabbed at her my blade was blocked by her naginata but i didnt know when she would bring out that counter sacred gear shinra senpai took out a small bottle from her pocket phoenix tears so the sitri queen had theirs she threw the small bottle at me and cut it apart with her naginat a the liquid inside was poured onto me reverse shinra senpai shouted that she intended to change the immense healing power of the tears into damage the instant it hit me i quickly changed my holy demonic sword into a sword of water bishah the wave of water mixed together with the tears when mixed with something else the tears lost their effect and as a result the reverse also lost its meaning if an opening is made even just a little senpai sharply turned her naginata towards me i see th e attack just now was to make me block and step out however zan holy demonic swords bloomed in profusion around shinra senpai the multiple holy demonic blades that sprouted out from the floor destroyed senpais naginata the current me has no opening s
when i tried firing a second bout of swords at her she made the mirror from before appear in front of her i weakened the swords as much as possible and they stabbed with just enough power to destroy the mirror barin dooooooooo the short lived mirr or broke and the impact was returned to me with double the damage but i could endure this much i clenched my teeth in pain and raised my left arm towards the sky petro basileus dionysius holy mary please listen to my voice space warped and a tear was created i stuffed my hand into there no way thats understanding the meaning of this shinra senpai was shocked in the name of the saints lodged in the holy blade i release thee durandal the item i took out from the space was the legenda ry holy sword durandal xenovia ill clear away your regrets here and now following the momentum as i took durandal out i slashed at shinra senpai the holy sword hit and serious damage was given to shinra senpai even in that situation she didnt ac tivate her counter sacred gear so she was unable to use it continuously it
was xenovias suggestion that in the case that she became unable to function and fight she would transfer the swords right of use to me since this sword is too good for her thats right xenovia had taught me how to use durandal and how could i who possesses holy demonic swords use durandal you ask however your holy demonic aptitude is shinra senpai said that as she was wrapped in the light of retirement teleportat ion i had no past because of that i saw hell butim different now thanks to attaining balance breaker it seems i can also handle durandal like this buuuuuuuuuuuun durandal was emitting a quiet and peaceful surge it wasnt letting out a violent and rampaging surge like it did with xenovia kuh this is you can handle it better than xenovia san shinra senpai said that but i didnt think so since xenovia has aura temperament that desires power durandal may have also reacted to that but i choose certainty over power ability over strength i had intended to suppress its power but even so the floor had been cut into two equal halves up to quite a distance away from the shockwave of
slashing shinra senpai it seemed i would receive a minu s evaluation because of this i thought that it was a stubborn steed that didnt listen to the words of its wielder but it really seems to be true it cut more than i thoughtso controlling it is still difficult this is outside of our calculations sona even more than hyoudou kun their true ace is the servant to pay attention to iskiba yuuto shinra senpai left just those parting words and disappeared from this place sona sitri samas queen retires its because i aim to surpass ise kun no the sekiryuutei mortifying it had been mortifying for me the loss against the phoenix family ise kun you werent the only one who was filled with feelings of frustration and mortification back then since rias gremorys true knight was taken out without being able to protect my master even though i had finally attained balance breaker the power of me and my comrades couldnt connect with kokabiel and i couldnt enter the battle against the hakuryuukou either i hadnt been helpful at eithe r of those times mortifying it was mortifying for me ise kun thats why i trained from
scratch under my teacher truly from scratch i learned from the sword basics again perhaps telling myself that i wasnt like you i also kept doing straightforwar d training to the point of foolishness if i simply prided myself on attaining balance breaker that will be where i degenerate into weakness more than anything else i hate it seeming like the only servant is the sekiryuutei you may be aiming at vali but my only goal was to be my masters sword and stand as a partner next to you my comrade rias gremory had not only the sekiryuutei but also the kiba yuuto of the holy demonic swords because i wanted to say that i ill also promise the same as you promised i will never make my master rias gremory cry again the only remaining opponent was the king sona sitri kaichou the roof of the department store the sky outside was white empty of anything because it was within the space of the ga me our remaining four members had gone there in front of us was sona kaichou kaichou turned her gaze towards us and smiled bitterly buchou asked sona why on the roof the king
must survive until the end that is the duty of the king if the k ing is taken out the game would be over right yes i didnt question the profoundness of that rias saji won against the sekiryuutei neither ise kun nor you made any mistakes please dont make light of that child you arent the only ones that are desperate yes i could sense it with my body now then lets settle this sona buchou took a step forward does she intend to do this one against one she was a person that wouldnt listen even if stopped in that case if i sense danger il l enter to help immediately i wont listen to your selfishness buchou didnt react to my words but she should have understood if buchou was close to losing i wouldnt pay attention to her protests and enter to help as well if the king was tak en down it was over i cant let you get taken out rias buchou then the battle between best friends started an aura of water gathered around kaichou and gradually formed something this was no ordinary amount of water looking at it the water seeme d
be collected from everywhere within the department store as expected of the sitri family whose specialty is water magic i had heard that the older sisters specialty was ice while the younger sisters was water in her magic buchou carried the power of destruction an attack that destroys the opponent without hesitation buchou fired magic bullets at her friend sona kaichou the number of bullets was endless like that of a machine gun the bullets were only about the size of a softball but i could f eel magic of high purity in each shot it seemed that the results of buchous training were also coming out that the only reason she wasnt attacking showily was because of the rules zabun zabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan sona kaichou manipulated the w ater and made it into a wall stopping buchous attacks the instant that buchous magic hit the water was also annihilated but because she was gathering it from the entire building it was unlimited now then rias i shall thoroughly display my water techniques to you kaichou transformed a large amount of the water with magic turning it into many hawks that flew in the air serpents that slithered on the ground valiant
lions wolves that herded together and several huge dragons as well so she can make this many different things at once her magic skill surpasses that of buchou just as i wished for sona smiling fearlessly buchou piled compression upon compression of her power of destruction and made a countless number of magic bullets in the air those without enough power would vanish from just one of those shots to have condensed that many of them it seemed that buchou had built up her magic power fairly well in her training both excelled in the quality of their magic but looking at it l ike this buchou stood out in power while kaichou stood out in technique both of them stood ready then the two of them unleashed their attacks at each other at the same time resignation confirmed it is rias gremory samas victory winner part 1 after the game had ended i woke up within the medical facility i was on a bed thats right this is the first time ive ended up here my case this time had been more a matter of blood loss than injuries it seemed i had been given a blood transfu sion
immediately after that and could now move like this i had gone outside and was drinking juice by the vending machine we had won however half of us consisting of me xenovia asia and gasper had been taken out and the gremory group which had bee n said to be overwhelmingly superior before the game had our estimation lowered our estimation seemed to have particularly lowered because of how gasper had been lost so quickly right at the start and how i the sekiryuutei had been taken out as the nat ural result hadnt come about the evaluation of those at the top was harsh buchou appeared completely mortified there were also the achievements of kiba who displayed ace class strenuous effort and the fact we had achieved victory in the end but it seemed that the end had been won by a direct confrontation between the kings this had been our first victorysomehow we hadnt been blessed with a complete victory we had certainly gone through a tough battle even though our group had enormous power we were far away from a perfect victory yeah this situation was bad shaking my head i decided to change the mood and
to go to sajis hospital room his injuries had also been completely cured already in the game we were enemies but once it had ended we were friends as usual well now ill go boast about buchous breasts again please take this i heard sirzechs samas voice from sajis room i could see inside the room from the slightly open door inside were sirzechs sama kaichou and saji on h is bed saji was receiving something from sirzechs sama he was holding an expensive looking small box in his hands uummthis is saji was nervously trembling this is something awarded to the person who excelled and fought the most impressively in t he rating game sirzechs sama said that while smiling however iilost to hyoudout this isnt a situation where i should be receiving this saji grasped the sheets of his bed in apparent frustration and regret thats true but consequently that isekunthe sekiryuutei was defeated we watched your battle in excitement from the spectators room to the extent that even odin of the norse praised you sirzechs sama took out a medal from the small box and put it on sajis chest you shouldnt humbl e yourself even a
devil like you can aim for the top im happy that i can see promising young devils of the future devote yourself more i have high expectations of you then sirzechs sama patted sajis head its fine no matter how many years or dec ades it takes continue aiming to be a rating game teacher at sirzechs samas words saji cried silently his tears flowed down endlessly and his face became disheveled saji you displayed a gallant figure to a lot of people because you fought a sp lendid battle sona kaichou was brimming with calm and self control from her eyes kaichou is also surely happy that her prided servant had gained such a huge estimation saji fingered the medal on his chest then wiped away his tears with his hand and no dded strongly yesthank you very much feeling that it would be impolite to listen any further i left that place saji congratulations i had only thought of vali as my rival i had believed without doubt that vali was the only rival i had to defeat i was wrong thats why ill say it to him face toface once more next time that im sorry hey
saji which one of us will advance to being a high class devil first and have our dreams granted iwont lose absolutely and next time we fight i ll win for sure so until next time my rival saji genshirou part 2 i came across buchou just before she entered my hospital room buchou buchou also noticed me and smiled like that we went into my hospital room and started to chat pleasantly ise thank you for your hard work in the game you did well but please dont embarrass me so much okay since your sexual desire really is too excessive buchou smiled bitterly aaaah i embarrassed her ssorrymy new techniques and power ups tend to b e related to my worldly desires that technique is sealed when in games eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh seriously no way seriously why i is it because its perverted because it will make us unable to fight against female devils a nymore so its banned uu if buchou says so ill obeeeeeeeey i nodded with teary eyes such a shame its extremely regrettable to think i would only be able to use it once ah but does that mean its okay to use in real battles
buchou smiled bit terly but we finally had a victory compared to last time it was better but i still lost ise asia xenovia and gasper even if our family is said to be blessed with ability and overflowing with power if that power cant be displayed at critical mome nts it has no meaning even though the probability of victory is high when you lose you lose it was just as buchou said if we had made just a single mistake we might have lost even though their chances of winning were less than ours our opponents desperately came at us because they also moved forward believing they would win if one gives in and is careless one can also lose the matches they could win me and buchou had realised this obvious fact once again theyre difficult these games the same with actual battles and just as i had seen the path to being a high class devil it felt far away but it wasnt an unreachable distance eventually i too like buchou but ise both akeno and koneko overcame their walls in this game this is som ething to be happy about buchou said that while smiling
that smile was wrapped in gentleness yes i think so too i feel like we won the match but lost the game but even so im happy that akeno san and koneko chan have advanced forward its thank s to you ise thanks to you everyone in my group are breaking through the things they carry youve broken through all the things ive worried about ise im very grateful nno i didnt do anything in particular i just thought about keeping everyon e happy thats right i wanted to advance forward together with everyone even if tough things occur like this time i want to break through them together because were comrades and friends ise im glad that youre my servantplease stay with me fore ver yes buchou ill always stay by your side i was also happy being able to see buchous greatest rank smile konkon suddenly someone knocked on the door to my hospital room after i answered yes come in an old man that i hadnt seen before c ame in he was wearing a hat and had only a single eye moreover he had a long white beard old man who are you when i asked
in puzzlement the old man laughed im the old man of the northern countryside sekiryuutei it seemed you need to study a l ittle more well you are devoted what was this overly familiar old man saying so suddenly but how did he know i was the sekiryuutei youre odin sama right this is the first time weve met im rias gremory buchou seemed to know him odin hmm i feel like ive heard that name somewhere before i see i see sirzechs little sister huh i saw you in the game well there was also something like that but i see hmm so big when i was watching i was fascinated by just these the old man was l ooking at buchous breasts with lewd eyes heeeeeeeey you damn old man those breasts are mine no one besides me can look at them with lewd eyes as i tried to ferociously protest a beautiful armoured woman who had entered the room at some point hit the old mans head with a paper fan geez did i not already tell you that indecent eyes were prohibited since theres going to be an important meeting now please pull yourself together as
the king of the norse gods truly a valkyrie with no openings i know already its a conference on terrorist countermeasures with the angels devils fallen angels zeus of greece and indra31 of mt sumeru the old man muttered with his eye half closed as he rubbed his head well its fine sirzechs sister and sekiryuutei the world isnt full of only trials there are many fun things as well advance forward while both fully enjoying and suffering throu gh it all being reckless is the only way for youngsters to grow up hohoho leaving just those words the old man and the armoured woman left my hospital room who was that that old manhe stared at my buchous breasts anyone who makes a move on buchou s breasts is my enemy no question about it ill never permit such a thing i asked buchou about it afterwards but apparently that old man was a northern god he just looked like a dirty old man really there are things i just dont understand in this world reunion part 1 the second half of august we of the gremory group were receiving a farewell from the underworld at the station in
front of the main residence well then issei kun i look forward to the day we can meet again you may return here any time without hesitation think of the gremory family as your own family buchous father said that as many servants stood behind him thank you very much b but that is a bit too grand for me i was smiling bitterly but buchous mother also affirmed it not at all issei san please take care of rias in the human world since my daughter can be so selfish i worry mmother w what are you saying buchous face turned deep red what a cute buchou yes of course i hit my chest a nd nodded ill take care of buchou it may be rude of me to say this but ill protect the woman i fell in love with all my life uu im also being moved to tears the future of my family is bright buchous father was crying eeeeeeeeeh why why buchous mother sighed beside him wait a minute dear isnt this where the father is supposed to retaliate by saying something like i wont give up my daughter yet even if you say that
issei kun seems to have surpassed my power already so isnt it enough already i think it will be fine even if i settle down soon please wait until rias has graduated from high school at least before talking about retirement he seemed to be getting excited but about what rias send us a letter during you r remaining summer holidays sirzechs sama said that while carrying his son millicas sama in his arms grayfia san was standing immediately behind them yes onii sama you stay well as well millicas yes rias neesama we had boarded the train and were giving our last farewells to sirzechs sama and the others from the window ah at that moment i noticed sirzechs sama millicas sama and also grayfia san i saw two parents and their child in that three shot as i thought it was like that it was nt a joke part 2 the return train i was being pressed by my untouched school homework thats right i had been busy since coming to the underworld but i had completely forgotten about this furthermore thinking back didnt i spend off the important summer of my second year of high school on
a mountain with a dragon i wanted to cryyyyyyyyyyyy i had used my precious youth on surviving in that mountain i didnt have any date with buchou nor did akeno san do any erotic things to me in my room i started on my japanese homework while crying but i did have some amazing experiences during my time in the underworld and i had done various studies we were strong in terms of power however in the case of opposing teams who took greater control than us no matter how great our power was we would lose depending on the tactics used if im also going to play the games as a king in the future i have to start thinking about tactics and the like right away because no matter how great my power was from the legendary dragon if i recklessly plunged forward and fell into my opponents tricks it will be an immediate game over if i was taken out as a king my team would have to resign though i should have won overall in power i was defeated by saji in terms of technique uwaahim so anxious about the future i spoke to buchou who
was sitting in the seat in front of me buchou what is it ive acted reckless until now in order to become a harem king that is my goal and my wish to become that has nt changed even now but tannin ossan told me that its a waste to set that as my final goal so i thought about it a little but i think its useless to just aim for an ordinary harem its best if i can make a harem with an attractiveness that wont lose to anyone and that is strong in the games as well buchou listened to my words and showed a very surprised expression but she soon smiled it seems the summer training camp was a success meeting other devils in the underworld seems to have been a big plus for you we both seem to have learned and advanced forward a lot yes i gave it my all suddenly koneko chan appeared thereand sat down on my laaaaaaaap i couldnt understand what was happening but koneko chan had sat down on my lap and wa s twitching her cat ears kkoneko chan i timidly looked at her face and then nyan she
smiled with a smile across her whole face yeah with just something like that my brain flew off asia had teary eyes buchou scowled with narrowed eyes and akeno san was giving off pressure with a silent smiling face but yeah cuteness is justice like this the train headed to the human world we lived in the time in the underworld has been fun it was a summer vacation i didnt think i would forget for my entire life as the train arrived at the under ground platform on the human world side i stretched myself well weve arrived weve arrived now then lets return home asia when i turned to look at asia a mysterious man with delicate features had drawn near asia asia argentowe finally meet uumm asia was bewildered this was bad was he a pervert i wont let you put even a single finger on my asia chan hey hey hey what business do you have with asia i came between them but the mysterious delicate man questioned asia with a si ncere expression so youve forgotten me we should have met that time the delicate man wait ive seen him somewhere before the delicate man
suddenly revealed his chest and showed a big scar there it was a deep scar asias eyes opened wide when she saw that that wound could it be asia you remember him yes my face couldnt be seen back then but i am the devil from that time asia became speechless at those words my name is diodora astaroth that time you werent able to treat it t o the point where a scar wouldnt remain but my life was saved due to your sacred gear i had heard about asias past she had been branded as a witch for saving a devil by chance thats right he was the devil who had been the trigger for asia being d riven out of the church diodora youre diodora arent you buchou seemed to recognise himah i remembered he was at the meeting between young devils the handsome high class devil from that time i think he was from the family of the current beelzeb ub diodora tenderly took asias hand and kissed it y you bastard what do you think youre doing to asia i was about to leap at him but without caring about that he spoke to asia
asia i came to meet you i apologise that i couldnt greet you at tha t meeting but i think the encounter between you and i was destiny i want you to be my wife i love you he had proposed to asia right in front of me the hot summer had come to an end and the autumn that would likely become long would soon begin afterword if the media expands id to made character songs with the breasts of each heroine singing the tsundere that has been long awaited by the readers has appeared in asias breasts that is its been a while ishibumi here more naughtiness h as been done yet again the story has come this far with just breasts as its material even im surprised its to the extent that ise has become a protagonist that does a power up like a super sayan and bakai by poking breasts now that i think about it ise snapped when buchous breasts were nearly halved didnt he about pailinguali was sick when of thought of it volume 5 is the thickest book so far but the afterword itself is also long so that i can talk about
it there are spoilers mentioned here after as well so please read the rest of this volume first new characters and the underworld now then the new characters this time are the monster dragon and the number one of the young devils but i plan for tannin and sairaorg to play an active rol e from now on so please look forward to them valis comrades were revealed one after another as well konekos onee san kuroka the mysterious holy king sword user are there any others that is a secret for the future the worldview was expanded in th e previous volume but i also had to depict in detail the devil industry in the main story so this time i described that from the beginning i made the three great powers alliance for the sake of the gremory group versus the vali team and for the rating games between young devils ill also move forward while focusing on that from now on and id like to talk about things like the worldview and the setting in between breaks because to the end the main story is the high school life and romantic comedy o f growing up of
ise and the others however making the worldview of the underworld was quite a challenge this work is a present day fantasy the present day japan is also the stage in this world having to make a completely different world from that was extremely difficult koneko and the club members the setting of koneko being a nekomata was discussed between me and editor san from the beginning of the series the chance never quite came around and her true identity remained unknown for over a year but the ban was removed at last this time with this all the members of the occult research club has had their pasts and identities revealed now i feel i just need to show how they grow after that everyone has something they carry with them but id like to have they overcome it along with ise when writing about the occult research club i have the habit to make pairs for example rias buchou and akeno san are the onee sama duo these two were often at odds with each other from volume 4 but this is because im writing them as the onee sama duo that compete for ise so xenovia has
become a duo with asia their first meeting was the worst but now theyre now friends through and through i wanted to establish a close friend for asia and for xenovia so i thought of making these two church related people a duo koneko chans companion is gasper aka gya kun and gya suke the first year duo theyre a slanted pair as a sharp tongued loli and a hikikomori cross dressing boy but theyre both cute kouhai so i hope all the readers love them as well the last are the boy duo ise and kiba in the story kiba actively teases ise the ace is kiba no matter how you look at it up until volume 5 the ratio of enemies hes defeated is in the top class among the club members ise is the main character so hell absolutely become strong in the future i also want kiba to become similarly strong as a partner who protects his back inside me i want to make him play as an active role as a rear main character followi ng ise and rias in any case hes easy to write about in battle last is azazel sensei he suddenly
showed ways of fighting that no one thought of to the club members and displayed himself as a deplorable teacher this time he didnt fight directly but even so if the number of readers who like sensei increase ill be happy now there are many worries about what will become of the remaining rook piece but thats something to look forward to in the future i think it will come out within the next year here is a single point about the front cover of volume 5 when you take the wrapper off and look at the front cover koneko chans is rating game volume 5s story focused on koneko and saji i was especially happy about writing the story this time because im been planning this battle since i first created saji since i wanted for ise to be defeated at least once and i thought that saji was the only one for that role i wanted to give ise an ordeal in the volume he attained balance breaker im a s evere author arent i there are a lot of prodigy characters in this series but even so i was thinking that id like to also bring out
effort type characters ise and saji are effort types i didnt want to write like you cant succeed if youre talentle ss because i have usually found that hard work pays out this is the back theme this time i originally like thinking about the battlefields and tactics in rating game battles but because this work is a romantic comedy i thought that they shouldnt just suddenly start playing the games so i started by reinforcing the characters and worldview first there are still more game battles to come in the future speaking of which did you notice the members that retired and the members that remained are revers ed from the phoenix battle advertisement its late but heres an advertisement short stories have started from this years dragon magazine november issue before that all the female club members also appeared on a ecchi swimsuit poster buchous is a string swimsuit a short story in the september issue but the announcement was slow im truly sorry to the readers who have only purchased the volumes you may be unfamiliar with the short stories but its mainly making the characters dash around i n jokes and ero moments the sale of
the short stories collection is still uncertain so please read what you want to all the readers thank you very much for all your support thanks to you this series has been doing well it seems it will continue f or a long time so please continue to take care of me id like to reach ten volumes by all means ive also received fan letters since volume 4 there have been a lot of comments about akeno san did everyone fall for akeno san in volume 4 i wonder i a lso enjoy writing akeno san since volume 4 pay attention to the ero ero onee sama duo from now on of course asia and koneko chan will also play an active part about me thanks to this i run to work every day my lower back which i fractured from we ariness back in early spring is still in rehabilitation but its mostly fine now health is number one ive also started drinking aojiru note vegetable juice made from green leafy vegetables thanks and about the next volume i give thanks to miya ma zero sama and editor h sama for finally being able to surpass five volumes
every time i oppai oppai talk to editor san its breasts this and breasts that when we went to a yakiniku restaurant together we also oppai oppai quarrelled i amended a nd corrected in akeno sans finger sucking scene in volume 3 and the truth is i corrected akeno sans scene in volume 4 as well i remembered how to use akeno san in volume 5 so there were no corrections this time this time i also wanted to do a ise po wers up by sucking buchous breasts but since i couldnt take out anything further from the fantasia collection it was poking instead but it was editor san who said the absurdity first requesting please put ero material in the battle scenes in vol ume 2 thinking that its fine as it is though i wrote and sent in the stupid development where girls clothes are sent flying thinking that theyd definitely refuse it i was told the best this is it this and given an instant ok that is the sec ret story of the creation of dress break im glad that dress break was born the support of it from the readers is also high consequently
the author and editor were both ero ero too however ive finally gotten to the point of talking about breasts bu twhat will become of this work and miyama zero sama i sincerely apologise for always bringing out absurd settings and characters but im already filled with emotion from your wonderful illustrations in each volume the perfection of your colour monoch rome pictures is so high they make me tremble and shout amazing amazing every time all you readers really please read the short stories as well just looking at miyama sans illustrations in the short stories make them plenty enjoyable with one of buchou as a little girl and of an attractive yuki onna you wont get tired of looking at it the front piece illustration of ises armour and valis armour in volume 4 was really exciting i was glad that transformation scene had been made and i unconsci ously gave a guts pose when i saw it its obvious but i always and strongly believe that high school dxd has managed to get this far with not just my power but also thanks to the assistance ive had from miyama san and editor san from the beginning

time soon really i would die from loneliness if you left me yo u know yes it would be a very serious thing if ise san died of loneliness asia answers me with a big smile aaah my adorable asia chan im really going to start bawling like a child if she got married i was this upset just from dreaming about it its pretty bad unya something is moving under the sheets waking up with a huge yawn is koneko chan w when did she get in here koneko chan wipes her sleepy eyes then wrapping her arms around me she went back to sleep what should i do her s mall body is so soft the only thing she is wearing is a white shirt so thats simply not fair it feels like her skin is rubbing directly against mine nyan her cat ears are twitching with her white tail tracing patterns in the air after finding out about her true identity the level of cuteness that she was showing now is like a deadly weapon wait if her tail is out then what about her panties d dont tell me no no i shouldnt think too much
about koneko chan like that it was decided a fter the training camp that koneko chan would come live with us that was okay but whenever she got a chance she would sit in my lap not to mention sneaking in and sleeping next to me though her sharp tongue and neko punch habits havent changed is sh e getting attached to me even though her usual attitude hasnt changed she comes into my bed like this so i wasnt sure how much i should spoil her to be honest im really happy anyway im glad that asia getting married was just a bad dream i let o ut a sigh while patting koneko chans head then i seriously wish we can leave it as a dream buchou who seems like she woke up before us sits on the bed shes holding a lot of letters are those letters i ask her and buchou sighs with a nod yes the one who sent them are diodora astaroth it looks like theyre love letters not to mention the movie tickets invitations to dinner and product tokens he also left some big presents at the entrance how many times has it been
now love letters eve n presents yeah lately these have been sent to my house well to be more precise they were sent to asia ungh the image of that gentle looking handsome guy appears in my head that bastaaaaaard proposing to asia as soon as we returned from the underworld asia also doesnt know how to respond to this so she keeps on apologising to us every time a package came she thinks shes causing us trouble its not asias fault there is no way it is two weeks had passed since then the summer holidays had ended and we entered the second semester however even i realised that my anger towards him is increasing by the day i immediately got up on the spot and shouted with tearful eyes i will never give our asia chan to him life1 the second term b egins part 1 the summer has ended and its already a new term the second term the opening ceremony has already ended and kuoh academy has begun the september event the preparation for the sports festival at this time of the year something tha t greatly irritates me occurs that is the number of people
who have shed their skin increases its something called a summer debut people use the summer as an occasion to go through a major image change well compared to when we were first years their number has decreased but even so people like that continue to appear if its the guys they have their hair changed by a beautician and if its the girls they change their fashion style to that of the current popular fashions so people who look ed dull just before summer begin the second term by having a new look last year i was shown that a lot and it made me hate it and close my mouth so i was jealous i also want to change myself im also a male high school student i want to dye my hai r have an interest in cool guys clothes and once had thought of trying them out and it really seems like you can become popular among girls with them the guys who changed themselves during the summer also have that as one of their motives changing yo urself during the summer and getting a girlfriend then graduate from being a virgin right summer is like
an obstacle for high school boys the glasses guy motohoma says it while nodding one of my evil buddies oh motohama did you get information regarding that he nods at my question yeah matsuda went to get the actual information right now heeeeey ise motohama i got the information the one who came into the class is matsuda seems like he got the information regarding that like we thought yoshida from the next class did it during the summer and it seems like he did it with an onee sama from third year that fucker that fucker motohama and i said with hatred just like we thought that bastard yoshida not only did he be come more fashionable but he also has a bigger attitude and now we know why its rumoured that ooba from our class has also done it with a first year are you serious ooba did when we turned around ooba whos wearing a refreshing smile waves his hand at us daaaaaamn it that non virgin is it alright to lose your virginity as easily as that it is right i also want to lose it since last year at the beginning of the second term
wed gathering information about the summer experiences of the p eople we know its the truth that boys lose their virginity during summer and for us virgins information like that is what we desperately want to know thats because it really makes you wonder who is a virgin and who isnt from the information we gath ered it seems the ratio of guys who have lost their virginity has increased since last year so most of the guys in our grade have already had sex whether you had sex or not has a huge effect on your status for high school boys the eyes of those non virgins looking at me with fill me up with hatred their eyes are saying aaah these guys dont know women yet and it pisses me off i lay on top of the desk holding down my head shit this wasnt how it was supposed to be i was also planning to change an d lose my virginity during the summer but instead i went to the underworld are there any high school boys who go to hell for the summer yes and thats me on top of that a dragon was chasing after
me in the mountains can you believe such luck nob ody would believe that i spent my valuable high school second year life going through life and death situations with a monster and i dont want to tell anyone either after all the only erotic event i had during the summer was the hot bath but other tha n that nothing nothing happened comparing it to the past its the difference of heaven and hell but i still wanted something more my first experience with buchou doing it on the bed with akeno san making babies with xenovia not a single one of tho se things happened during my time in the underworld i was fortunate that nothing happened to matsuda and motohama either during the summer if they go through becoming a man before me i will seriously commit suicide smells like virgins the one who ap pears while laughing at us is the glasses girl kiryuu her mouth is smirking and shes laughing with her nose kiryuu did you come to laugh at us she nods at motohamas question fufufu since its you guys im sure you spent a worthless summer shut up by the way hyoudou lately
asias been acting weird at times do you know why kiryuu asks me i know the reason it must be about diodora i also realise that asia panicked when the teacher asked her questions and she even held her textboo k upside down though asia is having a chuckle with the other girls right now asia is popular in our class shes popular amongst both guys and girls shes obviously a beauty where you get healed just by talking to her among guys there are those who t alk to her to feel healed rather than feeling love towards her rather than looking at her with perverted eyes they would rather get close to her and be healed well i dont blame them its true that i relax a lot when i am with asia asia notices that i m looking at her and waves her hand at me asia puts on a smile but she seems stiff hmmm its certain that shes being troubled now what should we do with the proposal while i was thinking about that kiryuu looked at me with suspicious eyes what is it no its just that since entering the second term your popularity
with girls has increased quite a lot are you serious but why your face has become more serious and even from my eyes i can tell that your body has become quite muscular t here are girls who say that youve become more wild hmmm i see i check it by touching my face i know that my body is muscular well it would happen naturally if you lived with a dragon in the mountains i also spent my life like a wild animal but me becoming wild huh i see fufufu people who notice do look at people seriously did my charm that increased during the summer start to fascinate the girls fufufu i work out after all that means i have grown up during the summer i put my hand under my chin and make a big grin and then kiryuu seems to feel down if only you didnt become so full of yourself wwhats with you feeling down i dont get her at all hhey this is urgent suddenly one of the guys in my class comes over in a rus h what happened he gulped down some mineral water that his friend gave him and spoke
out so everyone could hear him theres a transfer student coming its a girl after a pause eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh the whole class shouts in shock um it might be unusual during this time of year but a new student will be joining us everyone is excited at the teachers words the guys have high tension thats because its a girl you would expect us to be excited even though the girls are as tonished by the guys reactions theyre just as excited come in the one who comes in with the teachers word is oooooooooooooooooooooo shouts of joy come from the guys the one who appears is a chestnut haired girl who has twin tails and the g uys act like that because shes quite a beauty but for me rather than being happy i am so shocked that my eyes are about to pop out of my head when i look asia is acting the same way as me and xenovia has shocked eyes and cant believe what she is se eing of course we would act this way if she suddenly appears like this then people who know her would get shocked the transfer student bows her head down
and introduces herself with a big smile the cross coming down from her neck is shining she changed her hairstyle into twin tails but there is no doubt about it my name is shidou irina lets get along everyone yes its none other than shidou irina who came to retrieve the stolen excaliburs before summer with xenovia part 2 come with me fo r a sec during break irina was receiving a lot of questions from the guys and girls but i grabbed her hand quickly and took her to a place where there was no one except asia and xenovia shidou irina my childhood friend she moved to another country w hen she was little received a blessing from a church and became a holy sword wielder under the protestant church earlier there was an incident where the excalibur that was under the care of the church was stolen by one of the fallen angel leaders she and xenovia came to this town to deal with this incident xenovia learned the truth about god and remained in japan by becoming a devil without thinking properly irina on the other hand returned to where she originally came from we havent
seen her si nce but i never thought we would have a reunion like this man was i surprised it happened all of a sudden shes not our enemy right the three great powers made an alliance t then the reason why irina came here is it has been a while ise kun and also xenovia hug irina hugs xenovia xenovia im glad youre doing okay it might be awkward due to our positions but im truly happy yes it has been a while irina im glad you are doing alright yourself is your crosss dealing me some minor damage some sort of divine punishment the reunion of the former holy sword wielder duo xenovia is also showing a smile now now what should i ask while i was thinking xenovia began the discussion what brings you here yes a simple yet str aight question i transferred here by michael samas order ill give more details after the lectures ill be in the old school building okay irina says that while making a cute wink i sent a text message to buchou using my mobile and texted shidou irina came did you know about it she replied back yes it
was suddenly determined to turn into a situation like that ill introduce you to her with a proper explanation after the lectures so please look after her until then she is a transfer studen t after all ah so buchou knew about her obviously this is buchous territory so irina wouldnt be able to enter unless it had been discussed with buchou beforehand so ill wait until after school in the clubroom after classes shidou irina san i welcome you to our school all the members of the occult research club azazel sensei and sona kaichou gathered to welcome irina by the way the one on my lap is koneko chan it has become her personal seat yes everyone well there are people im m eeting for the first time but ive met most of you before my name is shidou irina church no i came here to kuoh academy as a messenger of the angels clap clap clap everyone gave her applause well i hear that she came as a support member from the heavens side if i think about it devils and fallen angels are here but not angels we are getting backed up by heaven though irina
began her speech about gratitude to the lord and michael sama is great everyone made a bitter smile but listened to her she has a strong faith in her teachings like always there was something i wanted to ask xenovia so i whispered in her ears hhey xenovia why are you speaking in a low voice irina doesnt know about the death of god right at least she didnt know about it when she parted with me thats right is it really okay all of us know about the death of god if this girl finds out will she get so shocked that something serious might happen i was worried about that but sensei asks her witho ut any thought you do know about the death of god from the bible right ssenseiiiiiiiii you cant suddenly ask her something like that i said it to sensei but he just sighed idiot if shes here then she received the mission while knowing all about it listen this place is one of the most important places among the territory of the three great powers alliance if someone affiliated comes here then it means they are stepping foot in while having basic knowledge
of it irina nods at senseis w ord of course governor sama of the fallen angels dont worry ise kun i already know about the absence of the lord seriously we look dumb for worrying about her you are quite tough i never thought irina who has such a strong belief in the teachin gs would come here without being shocked at all after a pause with xenovias words many tears started to flow out from both of irinas eyes she shouts while getting closer to xenovia of course im shocked my spiritual support the centre of my world the father of all creation dieeeeeeed i was living while believing in all of the teachings so i spent 7 days and 7 nights sleeping when i heard the truth from michael sama aaaaaaaaaaaaah lord aaah she started to cry while hugging onto the tabl e w well for a strong believer the death of god would be very shocking my family is non religious so i dont know how it feels but asia basically fainted when she found out about it i understand how you feel i know asia and xenovia gently said that to irina the three of them
hugged each other asia and xenovia continued to pray to god till this day i think they are still feeling grateful to god asia san im sorry for calling you a witch last time i even said horrible things to xenovia when we said our goodbyes im sorry asia and xenovia smiled at irinas apologies i dont mind im hoping we can get along since we all love the same lord same here that was also my fault for acting without thinking properly i turned into a devil imm ediately after all but im happy that we are reunited like this ah lord the three of them started praying can i assume that they have an understanding of each other now a lot has happened but it makes me happy that the weird tension is starting to disappear maybe this is the birth of church trio smiling with everyone is the best though two of them are devils can i assume that you are michaels messenger irina nods to confirm senseis question yes azazel sama michael sama was trouble d because not a single person from the heavens side is here he said its a problem if none of the
staff is in this area oh yeah michael did say something like that this location is active with the power of those from either heaven or the underworld but the ones who are actually working here are rias and sona sitris group and a small number of other people including myself well its functioning well enough with us but michael said something so serious that he thinks someone from heaven should al so work here and said he would send someone heaven has already given a lot of support which is more than we can ask for i said we dont need anyone but he said that he wont accept that and the one he decided to send is her sensei says that while si ghing oh so thats what happened yeah this place only has devils and fallen angels so it wont be weird if one or two angels are sent but buchous base certainly has become crowded there were only several devils in the beginning now fallen angels and people from the church come and have natural laughs we seriously dont know what will happen in life buchou also seems to have had complicated feelings in the beginning
but she started to get heated up with responsibility after being personally aske d by maou sama because of a reason like it might turn out useful in many ways and its something very honourable irina suddenly got up and started to pray then her body started to glow and white wings appeared from her back ooooooooh she looks li ke an angel wait did she become an angel everyone gets shocked but sensei calmly asks irina while putting his hand under his chin your name is shidou irina correct did you go through the angel transformation angel transformation there is such a phenomenon when i ask sensei he shrugs no the truth is there was no such thing until now though a possible theory was discussed between the scientists of heaven and the underworld irina nods at sensei who sharpened his eyes and is having a t hought yes i received michael samas blessing and became a reincarnated angel i heard that the seraphim used the technologies of the devils and fallen angels to make it possible such a thing is possible so the alliance of the three great powers has progressed that much i heard that an angel
couldnt be born due to gods death but even if it is reincarnated angels the number of angels should increase but irina is an angel huh devil fallen angel and angel all three are gathered here irina con tinues on four great seraphim and other seraphim the total of ten seraphim decided to have twelve subordinates called brave saints each with a position from an ace to a queen of the cards the cards of king will be the position of the angel sama w ho would be the master sensei took an interest with irinas discussion this person loves the discussion about technologies i see the evil pieces technologies so they used the technology of the evil pieces and the artificial sacred gears of the falle nangels huh man heaven sure did create an interesting thing right after we gave them our technology if the devils are chess then the angels are cards huh well cards also have the meaning of trump card in them after gods death the increase of p ure angels became impossible so increasing the number of reincarnated angels would connect to strengthen their forces so they turned the evil pieces into an angelic version
huh so things like that are also possible i see if you are using such a system then it seems like there will be someone strong called a joker hiding the twelve members also represent the twelve apostles man he sure does entertain me that elder angel sama sensei started to laugh with enjoyment this fallen angel governor sama sure likes to read through things so what card are you then irina i ask her because i want to know and irina says it with confidence im an ace fufufu as michael samas ace i received an honourable position i cant even die even if the l ord is gone i can continue to live if im michael samas ace oh her eyes are glittering ah there is a symbol of ace on her hand so the new support of your life is michael san huh when i said that with a sigh xenovia who is next to me responds yes its better than losing yourself well thats true rather than losing yourself with the death of god it seems like you can walk forward working under a new master irina tells us with joy also michael sama said he
can see a special rating gam e between evil pieces and brave saints happening in the future he also said that right now only the angels of the seraphim have them but in the near future high level angel sama besides the seraphim would be given this system and is hoping for them to ba ttle each other just like the rating games of the devils game against an angel the match between the evil pieces and brave saints we were shocked but sensei seemed impressed there are those among angels and devils who are against the decisio n made by the top people we had a relationship where we had wars against each other for a very long time so there would be those who feel uneasy if we suddenly tell them to get along but michael sure has thought about it like that hes preparing a rep resentative war where they can make their arguments into battle techniques and they can release them its just like the world cup or olympics of the human world so its for those people with uneasiness to release their stress hmmm so each faction star ted to have new political measures with
the alliance those things sure do look hard then would it be possible for us the gremory group and the angels who are using this game system able to have a battle sensei twitches his neck maybe in the futu re it will even if i say that not right away at least ten yearsor maybe twenty years well around then would be a good time for you devil rookies and you will be able to enjoy it ttwenty years that certainly feels long devils and angels do ha ve long lifespans looks like we are able to enjoy it kiba also looks interested our groups ace sama seems to be interested cchurches are scary gasper seems like hes troubled yeah i hear that the churches are still continuing with the vampire hunt we still havent negotiated with the vampires yet each of the churches is continuing with the same teachings even after the alliance but in reality they are cooperating with devils and fallen angels i hear that they made a new type of investigati on team to make sure new types of evil wont be born we and the sitri group gained that information in other words we
can take down anyone who makes a suspicious move within the three great powers alliance with our own judgement i hope we dont encounte r such things as much as possible we are trying to get along with each other after all peace is the best well even if a thing called brave saints appeared im glad it wont affect the rating game for a while right now i have my hands full with compe ting against the high class youth devils lets stop these types of discussions here and start todays welcoming party for shidou irina san sona kaichou says that with a smile irina also says that while looking at everyone all of the devils i have b een looking at you as my enemy and have been eliminating some but michael sama said we have to get along with them from now on okay so i also hope i can get along with everyone the truth is i personally wanted to get along with everyone i would li ke to work hard as the representative of the church please take care of me well there were complicated issues but with this it looks like irina will be
joining us as buddies of kuoh academy after that the student council members also joined us and ir inas welcoming party began part 3 a few days have passed since irina transferred yes yes i will do the scavenger hunt irina raises her hand up high she has already settled in with the class because of her energetic nature she is popular with boys and girls its currently homeroom time we are deciding which people will participate in certain activities for the sports festival haa instead im laying on my desk and sighing it was decided that irina will be living with us as well during t he summer the hyoudou residence turned gorgeous because it became six storeys high and has three storeys underground most of the members of the occult research club have moved and began living in my house and now even irina has started living there well there is sufficient space so it wont change if one or two more people begin living with us when the number of girls increases i find that i feel even more uneasy apart from my mum they are all beauties its an ideal place to live for any high
schoo l boy well thats what i thought at first but reality isnt that simple its true that three women make a market and there are no spaces for me to enter for example when asia xenovia and irina gather and start a girls talk its really hard to enter into a conversation with them when koneko chan enters the conversation there are no spaces for me to enter im the only guy you know what should i do play games read manga there is no way for an erotic guy like me to have a conversation with a girl to begin with when i become lonely and go to my onee sama buchou and akeno san also have a girls talk but the onee sama version and if i come in saying buchou or akeno san then it will just make me feel sad uoooooooooooooooooooooooo im shocked im a gutless guy who cant even cope with this i cant believe i was aiming to become a harem king in this situation i realise it once again my lack of spirit that is a harem requires you to take on several girls at once how can i have a hard
time in a situation like this but i dont know what to dooooo should i research what clothing brands girls wear and talk about it or should i find a fashionable clothing store and talk about that i dont knowwwwwwwwww i dont know what to talk about when i join the girls discussion it seems like the reason im unpopular is because of that and now im shocked well thats not the only thing happening at my house so its okay usually i spend my time at home getting along with everyon e but there are living styles for girls as well i shouldnt think too much about it well there are erotic situations at times but its scary when the battles between girls start huh thats weird am i having troubles when im having an ideal lifes tyle is a harem supposed to be something hard sob to old man tannin im having trouble during my youth hyoudou i was suddenly called by kiryuu right now she is standing in front of the blackboard and is writing about sports festival activ ities theres a tear under your armpit eh seriously i look under my armpit as kiryuu said but
it was too late when i realised it thats because i lifted one of my arms to check under my armpit obviously there isnt any tear yes its decided my name is written on the blackboard with chalk uwa you tricked me kiryuu i was tricked i was thinking so i let my guard down i make a complaint but she just makes a lecherous laugh you will be doing the three legged race your partner is kiryuus chalk points to a certain girl and the one in that direction is asia raises her hand timidly we will have you and asia do the three legged race like this it was decided that asia and i will do the three legged race due to kiryuus trick part 4 the next day the whole academy was practicing for the sports festival my class also changed into track suits and we were practicing on the school grounds with a mix of boys and girls i challenge you xenovia bring it on irina irina and xenovia are running at the grounds my classmates are also cheering the both of them on geez what are they doing more like both of them are fast
they are roaring noisily around the ground to be expected from a devil and an angel man if its girls only my class might win the only rivals we would have would be the student council members several girls in the sitri group who are in the same grade as us but if they move that fast its hard to see the movement of oppai yeah like i thought a proper velocity is most needed for them to bounce the three erotic guys matsuda motohama and i are observing the movements of the girls oppai both big and small ones are hard to keep your eyes off when they are running cheers to track suits irina is slender but she has quite the size if i remember her body parts were quite developed when she was wearing the bondage style battle suit my memory knows that for certain then there was someone who spoke to me oh hyoudou ah saji its sa ji hes carrying measuring tools and such what are you doing observing bouncing oppai yyou sure dont change saji sighs hmm saji has a bandage around his right arm a wound whats with that bandage hmm oh this
he unwraps the bandage a bit then there were many marks that looked like a black snake what is that i ask with suspicion and saji answers when i asked azazel sensei he told me the cause of this happened when i had a battle with you in the last game apparently connec ting myself with you the sekiryuutei who reached balance breaker and taking your blood had an influence on my body it seems like the line which was disconnected from my body also reflected the information of the sekiryuutei it had taken data of are you serious is it bad no it seems like it doesnt have a bad influence its just that its appearing on my body like this for example what saji shows me is a small jewel that has appeared on a part of his arm i thought it was a jewel but it is isnt it its identical to the jewel on valis senseis and my dragon type sacred gears maybe you got cursed when i said that he made a really disturbed face uwaa dont say something which i was having concerns about did you know th at vritra didnt leave that much
of a good legend saji changed the subject and then asks me so what activities will you be doing hyoudou im doing the three legged race its been decided that im doing it with asia ku you seriously are a lucky bastard im doing the bread eating race hmm bread eating race thats also fun but i will just enjoy my run with asia chan saji is being envious of me and two girls wearing glasses appear saji what are you doing we will be checking the setting of each of the tents so follow us quickly we the student council lack manpower anyway so please work its sona kaichou and the fukukaichou shinra tsubaki senpai both of them are calling saji oh both their glasses are shining yyes kaichou fu kukaichou saji rushed and went to their sides kaichou and fukukaichou sure look strict speaking of glasses i remembered the next heiress of the house of agares that person was also cool andwearing glasses are most of the people among devils who a re wearing glasses calm and serious saji waved his hands at me and moved to a corner of the grounds with fukukaichou vritra huh hmm ddraig
what do you mean no dont worry about it but it looks like the direct contact with me has fastened it gr eatly no matter how many pieces his soul was cut into it will be a different story when it has a start i dont even know what you just said close to you there are fafnir and vritra and you have met with tannin looks like this host has strong ties with each of the dragon kings hmm looks like ddraig san went into a world of his own asia did your oppai develop during the summer holiday kyaa kiryuu san please dont grope them ah the glasses girl is sexually harassing asia man when i take my eyes off her she always sexually harasses asia i should warn her afterwards or else asia will turn erotic she has already started to have an interest in those things because of buchou and akeno sans influence now i should start my practi ce with asia then from the tools for the activities i took out a rope for the three legged run asia lets practice yyes she bowed her head down to kiryuu who was going all over her
and came running to me quickly the other girls and guys in my class have already started practicing ah there are those who are good at it but their rhythms are off they also look timid because they are attached to each other asia and i also got closer and tied the rope to our legs okay lets do it immediately asia even though she seems embarrassed she puts her hand around my hip and we are now ready hmmm asias hair smells nice its because her body is touching mine but i can feel something soft no no i need to push away bad thoughts my partner i s asia self restraint self restraint after taking a breath we nod at each other and take a step forward now one two we move while making a sound but slip our legs tangled and we became unbalanced uoo kyaa i quickly grab a hold of asia who is about to fall and fix our balance h hmmlooks like i need to keep my rhythm the same as asias thats what i think when i look at asia her face is red and seems like she is enduring something huh hmm
it seems like my right hand is holdi ng onto something really soft hey im groping asias oppai i get it so the place i grabbed onto when asia was about to fall was her oppai hmm i think her mass has increased no i shouldnt touch them any longer than this i had my hand let go of asias oppai ssorry it wasnt on purpose i apologised what have i done even though i say that asia is important to me i ended up groping her oppai but asias oppai also have a good sensation i its alright im okay but please tell me you w ill touch them beforehand i also need to get ready its okay if i ask you then no thats wrong its not intentional i started to become troubled with self hatred and an urge to have sex but i wont last long at this rate i said it after taking a breath llets resume our practice then yyes but im sorry im not that good with sports asia feels down dont worry we just need to have the same rhythm its teamwork tteamwork asia bends her neck cutely yeah why is every single
ac tion of this girl really cute yes teamwork lets let our voice out together and move step by step we will run after we get used to it yes yes its the same as my training we can get used to it one by one it will definitely become a key for success thats what i who didnt have anything learned then lets do it once more yes like this we started by getting our rhythm right part 5 after school that day i make my way to the clubroom along with asia xenovia and irina the other members including buchou who arrived before us are wearing serious faces huh did something happen did something happen when i ask buchou answers yes our next opponent for the youth devil rating game has been decided hee so its already decid ed starting from the gremory vs sitri match there were games between the six households so the gremory group also has to battle all the other houses besides the sitri group i wasnt that shocked about it but i understood the reason for everyones str ange reactions after buchous next words our next opponent isdiodora astaroth i became speechless at
something i could only think of as a bad joke life2 asia chans w orries part 1 one two three four one two three four asia and i have been practicing for the three legged race today as well with xenovia helping us out lately we have been practicing every morning behind the gymnasium compared to the time before we began practicing for it we have gotten much better at it auu one two hauuu three four asia is desperately trying to follow me daily training is a must after all by working hard little by little we can get one step ahead fufufu i found that out while getting trained by buchou sensei and the dragon yes you guys have quite a good rhythm now now lets have you guys run as if its the actual race xenovia says that while fixing our rope when i looked at asia she seemed a bit gloomy huh is asia worrying about something well our next opponent is diodora after all asia has looked even more concerned ever since our next battle was announced asia tell me what is concerning you asia put on a confused face at my suggestion and then
tells me after thinking for a bit i dont regre t saving that person back then asia saved a wounded devil when she belonged to the church because of that she was treated as a heretic and lost her place and then experienced painful memories the devil whom she saved is none other than diodora i d ont know why he was there and met asia but the reason she saved him is because she is a kind girl i wont blame her for doing that there is no way i can she is a kind girl after all asias life did take a 180 degree turn for saving diodora but its certain that she is having a good life with us here but i do think about it would asia have had a better life if she was still a holy maiden is she having a better time with us than when she was a holy maiden so i do think about it sometimes if someth ing can be done about it now that maybe it would be possible for asia to return to her place as a holy maiden once again if i ask michael san no because
of the possibility that the system left behind by god might be influenced by asias power she wont be able to return to the church headquarters institutes related to it and places with surveillance by angels but she might be able to get her previous lifestyle back which one will she choose when i ask her im so scared that i cant ask her thats because i dont want to lose asia its my selfishness if i ask buchou that might actually happen if that would be for her best thenthat means im a selfish bastard i dont want to imagine asia disappearing from my current lifestyle ise san asia looks into my face you had a very serious expression just now you also looked sad hey asia if you were able to get your old lifestyle back what would you do asia gets shocked and opens her eyes wide im dumb so i ended up asking even though i might lose her but i was thinking of whats best for asia so i i am getting ready for her answer while my heart is racing fast my hand which is holding tightly onto her hands starts getting sweaty but
the answer asia gave me is i wont go back she had a smile she didnt even have any hesitation i have asked ise san once before i asked you can i stay by ise sans side forever ise san you said yes to me ah before the fight against phoenix i certainly did say that i like this place i also like kuoh academy and the occult research club i also like buchou san akeno san sensei kiba san xenovia san koneko chan gasper kun irina san and kiryuu san i also love ise san and ise sans parents the new lif e i started in this city is something very important and something i greatly love which makes it so wonderful asia i really am an idiot i should have known that this girl is having fun with her current lifestyle but why did iask such a stupid q uestion i then say while holding her shoulders yeah asia and i will always be together i also wont allow you to get married asia dont think too much about diodora no matter what happens you know that you can say no if you dont like it asia l
ooks in puzzlement but then shows her smile immediately yes xenovia then says with an apologetic expression asia i want to apologise to you once again the first time i met you i said harsh things to you i still regret it even now asia yo u treat me kindly you said im your f ffriend oh xenovia has a red face that you dont see often asia takes xenovias hand and says with a big smile yes xenovia san and i are friends they were straightforward words said face to face with complete honesty xenovias eyes became moist thank you thank you asia yeah even i started to become so emotional that i want to cry yeah asia chan is indeed a kind girl she really is my pride uuuuuu it really is touching i heard a cry dur ing this emotional scene when i looked in the direction i heard the voice i saw irina irina you also came uuu yes xenovia invited me she said mornings at kuoh academy also feel good and when i arrived i saw this beautiful friendship this a lso must be because of the guidance of the lord and michael sama irina
who has become deeply moved starts to pray to the sky if i remember you havent joined the occult research club right yes i decided to join another club or rather i decided to make one personally hmm so you are going to start up a club huh so whats the name and description of the club irina puffs up her chest with pride and says loudly ufufu be shocked by hearing its name the club name is shidou irinas salvati on of love club the description is simple we will help those in need without receiving anything in return aaaah i will be spreading my love to the sinful pagans for the lord and michael sama since i hold strong belief in our teachings she started pr aying to the sky while making a weird pose man her eyes are glittering lively but listening to her bad taste in naming her club makes it sound like a club where you wouldnt want to go for help umm yeah well do your best i could just reply ran dom words of encouragement irina bangs her chest and says leave it to me of course ill help out the occult research
club when it needs it this time i will be helping out the occult research club with the race between clubs because of rias sans requ est haa so she will be joining us for the sports festival then ill ask just in case but how many people are there in your club its still only me thanks to that it is only thought of as an association of like minded people so there are restrict ions on the activities and funds given i will have to start by convincing sona kaichou first that will be hard that kaichou is really strict fukukaichou is also strict it will take time for the club to be authorised so its decided that i will be p ut in the occult research club for now that basically means that she is a member of the occult research club no i shouldnt point that out i calm myself and then say putting that aside lets resume our practice xenovia and irina also joined our p ractice for the three legged race and the practice was resumed fuu i am a bit tired asia says while pulling her tracksuit we certainly did run quite a
lot since morning we are in the gymnasium storage room located in the corner of the school grounds we entered here to put away things such as the ropes used for practice maybe its because i am used to running that i have no trouble with this much exercise but i was doing it while worrying about my partner asia so i was tired mentally its s till really early for arriving at school so i decided to go to the classroom after i take a rest in the clubroom suddenly when i was about to leave the storage room after putting away the ropes slam the sound of a door being closed when i searc h for the source i see xenovia closing the door with her back facing the door w whats going on asia also seems puzzled at xenovias action whats wrong xenovia san asia asks xenovia replies seriously asia i heard that girls our age start to flirt with others during this period eh what did you just say i started doubting my own ears because of what i just heard fflirt asia asks hesitantly to which xenovia replies clearly it means you get your breasts
played around with b y a boy tthis girl she suddenly says such things in a place like this after closing the door and asia is also in here geez i really cant understand her at all on top of that the meaning of flirting is a bit different bbbreast asia exclaims in a high pitch voice with her face beet red xenovia dont suddenly start a conversation like that ise be quiet for a bit i will talk to asia first your role will come after that im sorry but can you start your warm up in the corner o f the room it will become very intense from here what role and it will become very intense what do you mean by a warm up should i just practice on opening and closing my palm xenovias talk doesnt end there there is a girl in our class who ha s her breasts played with every day by her boyfriend i researched quite a lot why do you research and ask those things seriously asia dont you think its a good time for us to also experience it xenovia puts her hands on asias shoulders and stat es that
with a serious face what is this hasnt it suddenly turned into a serious discussion aauuuuu e even if you suddenly say that asia is also troubled that is the right reaction its okay it might be a bit ticklish at first but i hear d its something that feels very good afterwards if you do that then you guys will be able to perform better in the three legged race how can you take the discussion that far eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh is combination formed by doing that is asi achan being convinced it cant be are you okay with that asia xenovia smiles at asia who is still confused asia we are friends yes lets also flirt together as well it wont be scary if we do it together y yes i is that so their discussion looks like it has been concluded please dont taint asia with discussions like thaaaaaaat xenovia then looks at me then lets do it i will also be practising making babies as well hold on you mean suddenly in a place like this well i have in fact been admiring the atmosphere and the location of the storage room for doing it though ignoring me
who is panicking xenovia takes off her shirt purun xenovias big oppai which are held with a bra are in clear view nosebleed my n ose also starts to spurt blood with her splendid way of stripping its not as big as buchou or akeno sans but xenovias oppai are also big i didnt even have time to make any more comments before xenovia unhooked her bra puru because the thing which was suppressing them is gone her magnificent breasts appear right in front of my eyeeeeeeeeeees why are the girls around me so aggressive and have such a splendid way of stripping but her nipples are a beautiful pink like always they are breasts which i havent had anyone touch except ise do you still remember how they feel yes i put that memory preciously into my heart i didnt grope them with my hands but they were really soft she is a swordswoman who has a stern body and i thought it would be the same for her oppai but i was dead wrong her skin is beautiful and smooth the sensation was really like that of a marshmallow the incident at the pool changing room that time
she also came to me saying lets make babies does this girl like stor age rooms isnt it usually a bedroom no this in some ways kind of turns me on but it isnt normal you too asia xenovia goes to asia heeeeeeey what are you doing holding onto asias track suit and trying to strip her bbutmy heart still isnt ready yet xenovia takes off asias clothes while asia is still being timid she was stripped to only her bra i become emotional at the sight of the cute bra its okay asia if you are nervous should i do it with ise first you will understand how to do it by looking at me and ise and you will be both ready and up for it eh u umm fufufu im joking i knew you didnt want to be overtaken by someone who came after you ii didnt mean it like that today is the chance buchou and akeno fukubuchou arent here now might be the only time we have the chance to flirt with ise asia became silent at that sentence uuu for me this discussion is going in a weird direction so i cant keep up
with it but i just had my eyes taken away by xenovias naked breasts unhook xenovias hand moves silently as she unhooked asias braaaaaaaaaaaaa ah asia with a very red face hides her exposed breasts yes normal girl s should be acting like this xenovia san you are being too straightforward no actually thank you very much its the best xenovia then takes my handand then pushes my body with a bang owaa i get pushed down and inside the floating dust i realis e that i have been pushed down onto the mat which was used in pe gapa something covers me shake shake the oppai which shake in front of my eyes xenovia got on top of me xenovia takes my left hand and places it on her breast nosebleed my nose doesn t know when to stop spurting out blood a deadly softness is felt from my hand my five fingers get buried into it the erect nipple is touching right into my palm giving me unreal excitement hey hey hey hey i will reach balance breaker once agaaaaaaaaaa aaaain isesan i dont want to lose to b buchou san asia who sits next to me takes
my right hand and puts it on her breast munyuu it isnt as big as xenovias but i can certainly feel asias breast with my other five fingers asiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ia im glad you have matured so much no thats not what i mean nn a sweet voice comes out of xenovias mouth my brain gets paralysed immediately like i thought it is different when you touch it yourself and when it gets touched by a man now ise both asia and i are ready you can now start fondling xenovia says that but asia is someone i need to protect but my instincts are making me grope asias breast without me realising it if you are a man you cant help but grope if there are oppai then you grope then buchou comes into my mind buchoooooooooooooooooou i also wanted to do this with buchou but if she welcomes me with a situation like thisthen ii clang the door suddenly opens i came here because none of you were coming out andw wwwhwhat are you doing in here the one who came in is irina crap two half naked girls and one guy a situation where i wont be able
to make any excuses this is irina we are talking about after all so she might say something christian like like filthy do it in a b bed this place is filthy and is no good what she called filthy was another thing entirely part 2 the same day after school its club activity time i want to do something about my grinning face but beca use of what happened this morning i have been remembering the sensation of asia and xenovias breasts for the whole day asia and xenovia are playing othello i couldnt have a proper conversation with them for the whole day thats because i still have t he sensation of their breasts in my hands theres no way i could focus on my school life i have been thinking about oppai throughout all the lectures xenovias oppai were great but asias were also no no i shook my head to get rid of evil thoughts asia is important to me i shouldnt hold lecherous feelings towards her b but its true that i think her body has matured at this rate maybe asias oppai will get as big as buchous and akeno sans oppai i have
heard before that devils can use their demonic powers to alter their body to a certain degree is asia making her body grow without realising no no this is just my imagination but that would be sweet a lecherous face squeeze koneko chan pinches my cheek ovchouch it vurts hurts koneko chan it feels like koneko chan has become strict like buchou lately no basically she points at me when i become lecherous but she also becomes unpleasant when i get along with other female club members its just my imagination you say i think that might be it looks like everyone has gathered after confirming that everyone is here buchou takes out something which looks like a video its a video recording that has the matches of the young devils our match against the sitri group is also on it the recording of the battles yes it was determined that we were going to look at the recording of the matches today so a big monitor was prepared sensei then says while standing in front of the monitor not just you guys but th e other young devils also had a game the house of the great king bael
and maou asmodeuss house of glasya labolas the house of archduke agares and maou beelzebubs house of astaroth each of them had a match after yours this is the recording of those ma tches its the video of your rivals so watch carefully yes everyone nods seriously at senseis words it really does make me anxious what kind of matches did the other guys besides us have they are all devils who are our peers right im really anx ious i want to know how they did in their matches everyone else feels the same and they all have their eyes directed at the monitor koneko chan who is on my lap is also focused on it first is the match between sairaorg the house of bael versus the h ouse of glasya labolas the match between sairaorg san and the yankee the video began and several hours have passed the excitement of watching the match of those besides us disappeared as soon as we started watching it the faces and eyes of every membe r turned very serious what we witnessed was a very overwhelming power in the one onone between the yankee and sairaorg san the yankee was
pushed back one sidedly the battles between their servants were already finished both sides had strong serva nts and it finished in a climax but the problem was the battle between the kings the yankee zephyrdor who lost all his pieces2 provoked s airaorg san and asked him to fight one on one sairaorg san accepted without any hesitation however all types of attack created by the yankee are knocked back by sairaorg san even if hit sairaorg san fights back as if nothing happened after finding ou t that his attacks arent working the yankee started to become more impatient and began to lose his calm and then sairaorg sans fists get released numerous defensive techniques are destroyed as easily as if they are a sheet of paper and sairaorg sans fist digs deeply into the yankees stomach it can even be understood through the monitor that his single blow has so much power that it even made their whole surroundings shake the yankee dropped down on the spot and fainted in agony while holding onto his stomach sairaorg san only used punches and kicks but the power of his attacks are on a totally different level when the
yankee dodged it sairaorg sans blow pierced through the building destroying most of it and their surroundings were blown away that kind of thing its obvious that you will receive fatal damage if you get hit by even a single one of them the one who was called the wicked one the new heir of the glasya labolas who is hated cant even put up a fight hes someone of that much caliber that man sairaorg bael kiba our groups ace also narrows his eyes at what he just saw his expression is also serious and he must have lots of things going through his mind sairaorg sans speed was quite something as well i couldnt ev en see what was going on and even kiba also had his eyes taken by that speed was kiba able to follow his speed just from the video he has this much power while having nothing in his hands gasper starts to shake and is clinging onto my arm dont flinc h gasper rias and sairaorg both of you have too many one onone battles even though you guys are the kings basically the king can just have their pieces march forward while
they themselves dont move you do know that the game will be over if the king is taken down right maybe those who carry the blood of the house of bael are hot blooded sensei says that while sighing buchous face goes red with embarrassment c certainly buchou does go forward by the way how strong is that yanke e devil buchou then answers my question if we didnt limit it to the current six houses then he wouldnt be weak but since the former heir died in an accident he participated as a representative akeno san continues in the ranking produced by t he game committee bael is ranked first agares is ranked second gremory is ranked third astaroth is ranked fourth sitri is ranked fifth and glasya labolas is ranked sixth its the comparison of average rank of their strengths including the king and their servants though each of them turned the result around after having a match but only sairaorg bael is excelling thats what it means right buchou buchou nods at my words yes he is a monster its said that maybe he will rise up in a shor t time when he participates in the
official game in other words you can say that our fame would increase if we defeat him i see he is thought to be the strongest so our fame would indeed increase if we defeat someone of his caliber is he stronge r than riser i ask buchou timidly riser is indeed immortal but its not like you cant defeat him but he was unmistakably a strong opponent i wont know unless both of them fight against each other but even from my own favourable views i feel that sairaorg is stronger uheeeeeeeeeeee that much there is someone who is that strong even before participating in an official game well ill show you the graphs theyre the ones that are distributed to each faction sensei activates his techniques and a holographic vision of a graph appears in the air on the graphs the faces of buchou kaichou sairaorg san and the other remaining three youth devils appear below it something which looks like a parameter moves and is getting longer upwards its written in japanese each graph has the category of power technique support and wizard so these are the types given during the game another one the king category
also appears maybe its the quality as a king buchou kaichou and the sis from the house of agares are fairly high at the current point kaichou is higher than buchou sairaorg san on the other hand is considerably high the yankee is the lowest on buchous graph the wizard category representing demonic power increases the most a nd her power category increases significantly as well the other categories of technique and support are a bit above the midpoint and are positioned in an average mark and sairaorg san out of the youth devils he has the lowest for support and wizard but the problem lies in his power the graph increases and keeps on increasing so high that it reaches the ceiling what an abnormal increase its too extreme but thats how much overwhelming power he has out of the other five devils other than sairao rgsan zephyrdor has the highest yet sairaorg san has several times more power than him sairaorg didnt even fight seriously in the one onone battle against zephyrdor sensei says that so he didnt fight seriously even just looking at his powers isnt it higher than my power while i am in balance breaker
state is it even possible to attain such a thing without having a legendary dragon so this person sairaorg san must be a genius as well then no matter how you look at it hes good at ha ndto hand combat but sensei shakes his head side to side rejecting my opinion no sairaorg is the first pure devil from the house of bael who didnt have any talents he also couldnt inherit one of the traits passed down from the house of bael the p ower of destruction the ones who strongly inherited the power of destruction are his cousins the gremory siblings something like that happened buchous mother came from the house of bael so the power of destruction was passed down to buchou and sirzechs sama and it didnt get inherited to the actual blood which is sairaorg san what irony but hes the strongest among the youth right by doing something which pure devils who inherited the gift passed from their clan normally wouldnt do he surpassed the geniuses normally wouldnt do sensei says with a serious face to me an intense amount of training that is sairaorg is a rare pure devil who attained power
by doing abnormal amounts of training he only had his own body so he train ed it to the extreme what azazel sensei just told me is astonishing thats because i thought that high class devils and pure devils are a bunch who had overflowing talents buchou was blessed with talent but sairaorg san wasnt buchou who is staring at sairaorg sans match has a complicated look on her face sensei continues as if he is telling us a story he was beaten and kept on being beaten since he was born and continued to get defeated among the highclass devils and pure devils who are colo ured with a brilliant environment he was the one who was walking on a muddy and bloody path so that is why thats why i felt a different pressure and confidence coming from him that is different to that of buchou and kaichou for a talentless person t o become chosen as the next heir do you know what an exploit that is hes the real deal since he knows the great difference between humiliating defeat and the happiness of victory well in sairaorgs case his strength also comes from something which i
s a secret though the video for the match ended its sairaorg sanbaels victory at the end the yankee from the glasya labolas hid himself behind a shadow and the match ended when he declared his defeat while being frightened of something the yank ee became frightened and dropped down in tears sairaorg san left his place while not responding to it at all that yankee guy is pathetic no i couldnt laugh while saying that even we were oppressed by the feeling of overwhelming power though it wa s just on the monitor i felt something strong coming from him which drives him to achieve victory sairaorg sans expression is that of not flinching at anything and just walking straight ahead to his path the video finished and then in the room which had become dead silent sensei says ill tell you guys beforehand but after your fight with diodora your next opponent is sairaorg are you serious i ask him shocked and sensei just nods buchou also asks sensei with a doubt is it not a bit t oo early i thought we would fight glasya labolas before him hes no good now buchou and everyone else put
on a doubtful expression at senseis word zephyrdor was crushed in his match against sairaorg his soul was carved with fear in his match agai nst sairaorg he wont be able to fight now as sairaorg has crushed both his heart and mind thats why the rest of the matches will be done with the remaining participants the house of glasya labolas ends here for the matches among the youth in my eyes zephyrdor who is still shivering in fear even after the match appears at this point the yankee has crushing their mind i see so thats what buchou meant when she said he might be stronger than riser even if he is immortal he wont be able t o resurrect if his mind gets torn you guys also should be careful he will come at you while having the high spirit of crushing the mind and spirit of his opponents he really is trying to become a maou not even a slight hesitation or the will to give i n lies in there senseis warning definitely does strike deeply into me yeah we definitely cant let our guard down i reached balance breaker after all i will cooperate
with everyone and defeat sairaorg san buchou then says it while taking a single b reath first we need to focus on the next match we will also watch the video of the astaroth whom we will be fighting next i heard that they defeated their opponent the next heiress of the archduke seegvaira agares the archduke lost so that si s with glasses who confronted the yankee lost her servants seemed quite strong as well though that man diodora who defeated her what kind of strength does he have sona who gave us a hard time received a gold star mark and like akeno said earlier the astaroth who defeated the second rank agares received a big gold star mark it certainly is regretful but it was the rank given before the match began and they were nothing but predictions so no one can tell what will happen when the game begins th ats how the rating game is buchou says that so people besides us also had a hard time i thought about it during summer but we wont know what will happen during the game but i never thought that agares would lose buchou says that while
trying to play the next video and then it happened flash at the corner of the room a transportation magic circle for a single person appears eh whats happening did someone come its an unfamiliar symbol astaroth akeno san says that and after a single f lash the one who appears in the corner of the room is a gentle looking guy with a refreshing smile and the first thing he says is how are you doing it is i diodora astaroth i have come to see asia the ones sitting around the table are buchou d iodora and azazel sensei who is sitting there as an advisor after pouring green tea for diodora akeno sits next to buchou we the remaining servants are looking at them from the corner of the room it kind of reminds me of the incident with riser it was also like this back then the difference between a high class devil and low class devil that is whats different from the incident with riser is that this time it isnt about buchou but asia instead asia who is sitting next to me is putting on a tro ubled expression i hold onto asia who
seems nervous and she also grips back on my hand as well her nervousness has reached even me buchou knows what she is doing and asiano matter what happens i will protect you so rest assured i will even turn into balance breaker in order to decline him though if i end up doing that to a high class devil then it will cause a problem i have broken off buchous engagement by doing that once i can even do it a again diodora who doesnt even know i had su ch determination says to buchou while making a gentle smile rias san i will say it straightforwardly i would like to trade bishops trade the rating game system where the kings can exchange their servants who are their pieces i hear tha t it is possible between the same chess pieces from ravel if it is bishopthen it would be either asia or gasper iyan is he talking about me gasper tries to protect his own body but i slapped his head of course not this guy sure has become stronger until recently he would be screaming heeeeeee i is he talking about meeeee and maybe hide himself in
a box so there is a result in the underworld training even for gasper by the way his training with overcoming garlic is still in progress sometimes he smells like garlic and its like his charm now anyway the bishop that diodora wants is asia the moment she heard him say bishop she gripped onto my hand strongly it feels like shes saying i dont want to the servant i am seek ing from rias san isthe bishop asia argento diodora says it without hesitation and looked at asia his smile is a refreshing one shit like i thought he was aiming for asia not just that isnt it horrible that hes trying to get asia through a tr ade shes the one he proposed to the one i will be arranging is diodora tries to get out a catalogue quite possibly the one with his servants on it but buchou says it without any pause i thought so but im sorry i thought that i should say it before you show me that catalogue with your servants so let me say it before hand i have no intention to have a trade its not that your bishop doesnt match
up with mine but i just simply dont want to lose asia she is my important servant devil buchou said that face to face uooooooooooooo buchouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu i became emotional the reason she didnt look at the catalogue is because she didnt want to show us that she will be comparing us is it because of her ability or is it because of her charm as an individual but diodora asks normally t this bastard she said no so just give up and leave buchou then gives the best answer to him both i think of her as my little sister buchou san asia puts her hand to her mouth and her gr een eyes get teary i think she became really happy that buchou said she is like her little sister we live together having my affections deepen and not wanting to let go of her wont be a good reason i think that is a good enough reason i cant unders tand you for trying to get asia through me with such a method diodora do you understand the meaning of a proposal buchou says that with a smile filled with intensity in it she says it in the
most appropriate way she can but anyone can tell she is pis sed diodora still has a smile that instead makes it creepy i understand i will retreat for today but i will not give up diodora got up and walked towards ustowards asia he stood in front of asia who seemed troubled he got on his knee and tr ied to take her hand asia i love you its okay destiny wont betray us even if everything in this world rejects us i will overcome them no matter what he said something i totally cant understand and tries to kiss asias hand snap something snapp ed inside me grab before i had realised it i grabbed onto diodoras shoulder and stopped him from kissing diodora then says it with a refreshing smile can you let go of me i feel a bit sickened to be touched by a filthy dragon tthis bastard he said it with a smile so that is your true face i was about to get pissed but slap asias slap smacked onto diodoras cheek asia hugs onto me and says it with a shout please do not say that i never thought asia would have
slapped him but i feel relieved diodoras cheek became red because of the slap even so he wont stop his smile he can still keep his smile on and that is so creepy that it scares me i see i understand then how about this in the next match i will defeat hyoudou issei the sekiryuutei then i would like you asia to answer my love there is no way i will lose to you i ended up saying it to his face no thats because he decided all this by himself but this is oka y its easy to understand i just need to beat him this guy that is sekiryuuteihyoudou issei in the next match i will defeat you diodora astaroth i will show you the power of the dragon which you called filthy to the extreme diodora and i g lare at each other i wont hand asia over to him then senseis mobile phone rang after a few exchanges sensei tells us rias diodora good timing the date for the game has been decided its in five days the day finished there and diodora went home dont come to the club room ever again with a
new resolve i got heated up for the upcoming game the official information about the game which came from the maou reached us several days later part 3 high class devil huh the devils work late at night i have finished a single request and am pedaling my bicycle because i am on my way heading home thanks to the training in the underworld i am able to transport using a magic circle but my regular customers think that i riding a bicycle so when i showed up using the magic circle once they felt let down because of that i returned to my old ways of riding a bicycle even though im able to transport using a magic circle it has no use but i cant betray the expectations of my regular cust omers and i think the number of requests will increase if i become a bicycle devil i also have to say that riding a bicycle is good training training with guts has been put into my body strongly now and so i was thinking while pedaling its abou t the high class devil i experienced it in the underworld but noble devils tend to look down
on other devils below them buchou and her parents wont do that but just like the incident with riser and also with diodora basically the high class devils fr om the old families dont have a good opinion towards the reincarnated devils and low class devils its unfair its easy to think like that but if i think carefully they are devils with a long history so they wont think well of those who suddenly show up and expand their authority those kinds of things are hated by the ones who have been present since long ago i really dont understand them though im a reincarnated devil and a low class so i desperately work hard to have myself acknowledged buha sports drinks taste good on my way back i took a break in front of the vending machine but i took a step back at the sudden presence who is it the one who appears from the darkness isa guy wearing rough clothes its been a while sekiryuutei bikou why are you here yes its the refreshing smiley faced sun wukong this time he isnt wearing chinese armour and he appears dressed up like a flashy young person i
mean why is this guy here well i came to accompany my partner bikou looks back dont tell me its and the one who appears is its been two months hyoudou issei vali appears wearing a white shirt vali i put my alert to the maximum and made a stance on the spot shit why are these guys here i hear that you reached the complete balance breaker it makes me happy i became a bit peeved at his smile he sure does look down on me like always yo the genius hakuryuukou do you want to continue from where we left off here i try to activate my boosted gear b ut he just laughs you are quite aggressive today hyoudou issei for me you are a big hindrance to my future plan to become a high class devil even if you dont worry about it i think you will become a high class devil in a few years time to have been complimented by the hakuryuukou sure does make it likely in my case i dont think its that easy so im desperately trying to achieve higher i didnt come here to say that today then why did
you come i hear that you will be having a rat ing game and your opponent is the next heir of the house of astaroth where did he hear that from well this guy is the boss of a special team of terrorists he might have many individual connections what about it you should be careful while not losing my stance i ask vali with a doubt what do you mean but vali just shrugs his shoulders you saw the recorded video right the match between the house of astaroth and the princess from the archduke just like vali said after diodora returned we the gremory group watched the recording of the match between diodora and that sis from the house of agares the match was diodoras victory but diodoras power was overwhelming only he showed abnormal power during the game and he defeated the agares sis and her servants diodoras servants just supported him and the king fought by himself and showed the power of a mighty warrior3 diodora is a wizard type who specialises in demonic power he oppressed the agares by showing powerful demonic power that surpasses buchous and we all became suspicious after seeing that we
didnt pay attention to the game but diodora himself thats because he suddenly got a power up before that that agares sis had the advantage was he hiding his true power till the last moment sensei saw the match live but he had doubts because of the intense power up of diodora compared to the data he was gi ven before the match buchou also had the same opinion diodora wasnt a devil who was that strong both of their opinions were the same diodora was plenty strong enough before the power up he was a high class devil who had demonic powers a bit lower t han buchous but during the match diodora showed a power which astonished everyone everyone was like can you really become that strong in such a short time but this match also became a battle between the kings at the middle do all of the youth devi ls have the wrong idea that the opening and the mid game should be about strategies and the end game should be a direct fight each of the vips from each faction observing the matches are enjoying seeing new types of battles though particularly battl es between
kings seem to get them heated up well it wont get through the skulls of those high class devils if its coming from my mouth but i thought that it might be okay for you to know it should i say thank you or what and it happened when i was having mixed feelings a shadow appears vali and bikou also didnt anticipate it so they also looked that way who is it nuu the one who appears from the darkness is a big build daughter born from a man who has an unbelievable amount of mu scles and is wearing gothic lolita clothes and hes wearing cat ears on his head like always miltan my regular customer did he come to pass by but for him to come past me while i am doing my job as a devil some unknown power must be behind thi s miltan the moment he appears vali looks at him twice he probably cant believe what he is seeing nyo he raises his hand and greets me and comes up to me i also raised my hand and greet him with a smile i forcefully made judging from his ears is he a
nekomata even i couldnt sense him until he came closer is it senjutsu vali asks bikou with a serious face thats not it i made a comment at vali within my head no that is isnt it some type of troll cat troll bikou also bends h is neck and is troubled at how to answer im also troubled at how to answer so dont ask me as well but because of mil tans appearance the tension in here is gone it also feels like vali softened his battle instinct as well you are amazing mil tan well who cares lets return bikou after just saying that vali tries to leave with bikou wait you came to see me just to tell me that vali shows a laugh at my question i was nearby so i decided to warn my future rival dono see ya sekiryuu tei hey vali lets go to the rumoured noodle shop on our way after saying that vali disappears into the darkness while taking bikou with him geez i dont get it i cant understand whats going on how can he show up in front of me with a refreshin g face after causing so
much trouble and he appears as if he was taking a walk your rival is a weird one ddraig also says that right i also think so well you are also quite a weirdo as well what a rude guy but im having fun what is it all of a sudden it feels like you speak to me the most out of all the possessors i ever had you are the first host whom i think i have fun having conversations with thats because im clueless and i need to ask many things or else there are lots of t hing i wont know about maybe thats a good thing you dont treat me like a tool but as a single being you arent a being im rather shocked at that instead ddraig you are a sekiryuutei are you not a am i wrong kukuku you sure are a weird one hmm i really dont understand heavenly dragons at all part 4 i see so thats what vali told you when i returned to the club room after finishing my job i had buchou remain and told her about what happened buchou put her hand under her chin and is
in thoughts if he entered this town then we should have known about it but we cant find them at all a technique to eliminate your own presence a certain application of the senjutsu or did they use kurokas space barrier buchou activa tes a small magic circle and it seems like she is contacting someone i will report about this to onii sama and azazel just in case buchou then makes a small smile after she finished reporting about it we should also be on alert about diodora its n ot like i believe in what vali said but there is a need to be on alert about it now shall we go home then yes like that buchou and i headed home i pedal the bicycle and buchou sits behind me when buchou puts her arms around me its the best because her oppai get pressed onto my back everyone should be resting at home now all members apart from kiba and gasper live in my house i heard that kiba and gasper live in a mansion near my house together gasper kun learned how to go outside the old school building now4 he sure did grow up
kibas house is located near my house so if something happens he can come right away when buchou and i arrived we go directly to my room when we opened the door ara ara ise kun welcome home the person standing is akeno san who is wearing an erotic costume aakeno san that costume a costume from a character in a certain game which has lots of exposure miko5 its like a miko costume and it reveals her whole thighs and also her breasts are exposed a lot where it just hides the import ant part amazing erotic you look ecchi akeno san if you turn around like that your oppai will spill out its a costume which doesnt have any way to put on underwear so its certain that she isnt wearing a bra akeno san then smiles at me ufufu remember what i told you last time if its okay with me wearing it that i would wear this for you do you not find this to your liking ah we certainly had a discussion like that before the match against sona kaichou in the bookstore i never expecte d that akeno san would remember it nno its
the best i made a lecherous face and made a reply of joy it really is the best im glad ufufu what should we do now should we have an observation party or akeno san gave an erotic gaze at me while squeezing her breasts do you want to have private party on top of the bed with touching allowed nosebleed i had a strong nosebleed with her words which shook my thoughts yes i was going to say that but i had my body frozen by the killing int ent i felt behind me when i looked around it was buchou who had a dangerous smile and she then says it to akeno san akeno what are you doing ara rias so you were here akeno san said that on purpose akeno san mostly calls buchou rias at hom e at school and when we are doing the devils job she calls her buchou i am here since this is my and ises room its obvious that im here i see then wait there for a bit im trying to have ise kun get some fun you are a hindrance buchou freezes while smiling at akeno sans words and
she then says it with a shaking voice hindrance uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah shes wrapped in a red aura this is bad a fight is going to start i feel danger but several girls appear from the corner of the room its asia xenovia and koneko chan what are you girls wearing the design is a bit different but asia and xenovia are wearing miko costumes similar to akeno sans then of course it means they have lots of exposure uwaah asia is showing h er thighs that much she has great legs but your onii san feels complicated its really great because of her white skin and slim legs yeah its easy to move i cant wear my underwear with it but its good since its easy to move with it xenovia sa ys something like what a warrior would say what no bra you arent wearing panties either bbut if we dont wear a bra thenit can be seen through asia says it shyly while hiding her breasts just like she says i can see a pink thing when i lo ok carefully no no no matter how beautiful asias pink thingy is i cant look foot steps while i was
getting excited the one who approaches me is koneko chan whom is wearing a cosplay costume of a beast comparing to the other girls she barely has any exposure but her real cat ears and tail are too lovely do i look good in it nyan the pose she just did while saying nyan has an unknown amount of impact on me cute this loli loli koneko sama is so cute the girls are doing a cosplaaaaay w hat is this dreamy situation i will also wear it buchou who has teary eyes didnt want to be left out so she went to the corner of the room to look through the piles of cosplay bbut how did it turn out like this a sudden cosplay tournament so i ask akeno san well when i told everyone that i would be fulfilling my promise with you they said they wanted to wear it as well so it turned out like this i see everyone must have done it out of curiosity but everyone has nice figures so their cosplay is amazing hmmm maybe i should record it with a camera afterwards can i use it as my private power generator6
open the one who ca me out of the changing room is buchou who is wearing an erotic devil costumeeeeee she has her real devil wings flapping adorably now ise i look better dont i i know what kind of costumes ise likes buchou makes a pose with pride her oppai are sha king yes you look good in it but buchou sure does hold strong rivalry towards akeno san akeno san walks to the changing room after seeing that when she comes out quickly she is now wearing a costume which is basically a string nosebleed my nosebleed isnt stopping shes basically naked her n nipples can be seen if she moves a bit isekun costumes which have this much exposure are the best right amazing right in front of my eyes something unbelievable is happening isekun put your hands up and have your finger pointed upwards as well huh just like akeno san said i had my right index finger point up then akeno san grabbed my hand and made it go to her breasts zoom mnyuuuuuuu my index finger gets sucked into akeno sans breast nosebleed my nosebleed flowing out increases unbelievable softness which surpassed a marshmallow
can be felt with my index fingeeeeer aaan this isa amazing ise kuns finger when i saw ise kun glaring at diodora my heart was be ating fast ise kun showed his manly side soi couldnt hold myself akeno san says it with a stimulating breath an unknown electricity runs through my body why is this onee sama so erotic this is bad i will reach balance breaker once again it feels like im going to it feels like i am continually touching girls breasts buchou grabs my left hand silently she then takes it to her breast mnyuuuu my whole left hand touches buchous breaaaaaaaaaaast uwaaaaa right now im touching the breasts of the two great oneesamas at the same time nuuu like i thought my chest gets hotwhen im being touched by ise what is this comfortable feeling it increases the more i get touched by ise so i end up releasing noise aaaan my nose starts to burst blood like a waterfall with buchous sweet sound im going to die from blood loss but no matter how many times i touch buchous oppai i never get bored of it her smooth silky skin is so elastic and
soft that it can bounc e and bounce more than that her breast which i cant fully hold onto gets out between my five fingers and it is overwhelming and when i close my fingers the sensation of the overwhelming breast is amazing im going to reach it i definitely am going t o reach it it seems like i will reach to a new power my right hand which was poking on akeno sans breast is now groping it instead when i realised it i focus all my concentration on my hands so i can enjoy the unbreakable pudding i dont know if i sho uld describe it as being juicy but this basically demonstrates the softness of a womans body aaah when i compare it like this buchou and akeno sans oppai are definitely different akeno sans breast is a bit softer but buchous is more elastic even though they have me touching their breasts there are sparks between their eyes buchou then shouts with teary eyes i wont lose to akeno this time buchou went to the changing room ah akeno san also goes in no i can definitely show a better post ure to ise kun
than rias ise said that i am attractive that isnt true last time ise said my body feels good you probably made him say that by force wait did you call my ise casually with his name why cant i iseiseiseise rias you du mmy akeno you stubborn head today i wont forgive you the two onee sama started fighting inside the changing room are they on good terms or bad terms i started thinking that they really are friends ise senpai here is the tissue you need t o stop the nosebleed koneko chan thank you ah crap i dont have much blood left this isnt good when both of them start their fight we cant stop them lets move to another place we are going asia yyes i was dizzy with blood loss so asi a and xenovia took my hand buchou and akeno san started shouting by saying things like waa and kyaa inside the changing room so we moved to the room next door so the match is in five days its soon xenovia says it while moving her piece for t he devil style the game of life in the room next door the four
of us asia xenovia koneko chan and i started playing the game of life devil style the game of life its the underworld version of the game of life we start as a low class devil and move our rank to mid class high class and then ultimate class you win when you become a maou the actual underworld isnt that simple like this but just like in the human world this is also popular in the underworld we sat around the table koneko chan is on my lap i sometimes lose myself when i can feel her soft bottom but i need to remain calm because i touched the breasts of xenovia asia buchou and akeno san repeatedly my brain is about to melt i think i can masturbate repeatedly with the sensation i still have left in my hand man if it is between lovers you can experience that twenty four seven i want to make a harem quickly so i can have the environment where i can grope tits because i had so much blood loss my consciousness is abou t to get cut off am i losing too much blood both in private and during battles
man i can hear the voices of the onee sama through the walls they sometimes fight seriously im the cause of it but koneko chan gave me the advice that when it turns like that rather than stopping them it is better to have them fight i think according to koneko chan ise senpai needs to know more about a maidens heart maidens heart will i be able to become popular if i understand them more haaaa i want to be popular with girls then someone knocks on the door and then enters its irina waa when i got home rias san and akeno san were having a big fight i was surprised ah is it game of life let me join too irina who went to the church7 after finishing her errands reacted to the game of life devil style one waa im interested in it for a reincarnated angel like myself i th ink i can enjoy it with a mix of feelings since i will be able to experience a fake life of a devil this girl seems to have fun at everything chuckle asia makes a small laugh hmm whats wrong asia when i ask asia
says it with a smile yes i thought that this is fun yeah it is fun but why all of a sudden isesan i love my current lifestyle and i love everyone as well i know dont worry about the next rating game we just need to do our roles normally when i cheered her up xeno via nods thats right asia asia and i are friends i will become your sword and beat anyone who will cause harm to you she sure is dependable it must be xenovias own way of cheering her asia lets finish the game quickly so we can get first plac e in the three legged race yes asia makes a big smile yeah iwe will protect asia i wont let her go to diodoras side then the door opens and buchou enters shes wearing a bunny outfit were they having a costume battle or what ku it feels like more blood will be coming out from my nose im sorry all of a sudden but when buchou looks at all of us she had a doubtful expression we are getting interviewed we will be appearing on a television programme in the underworld we will
be appearing as the youth devil and get interviewed including myself everyone had a dumb look but asia i asia argento became very surprised we will be appearing on television daily life with ise san has lots of shocking events every day several months have passed since i started living with ise san i was able to attend school and i started to become friends with kiryuu san matsuda san motohama san and everyone else in the class buchou san akeno san kiba san koneko chan and gasper kun are treating me very nicely xenovia san is my friend who is the same age as me i also became friends with irina san ise sans otou sama and oka sama are very kind and my life in japan is ver y new and fun things i couldnt do while i was in the church are now fulfilled a sudden proposal from diodora san i was very shocked it was the first time a man did a thing like that to me so i didnt know what to do but ise san said stay by my side to me that is enough for me if i can stay with ise san
then that is enough for me im happy if i can live and laugh with that person lord please allow me to be with ise san forever let me stay next to him forever and please listen to one of m y wishes i if i can wish for it if someone were to propose to me next make it that person i know i am being greedy but i love him so i dream about it a bit i feel really happy when i embrace my dream lord please look at me with warm eyes while i spend my life with that person whom i deeply love boss x boss im sorry im reporting to you by this communication system sirzechs its about the mysterious death of the heir of the glasya labolas and the increase of diodora astaroths demonic power s so it was related like i thought the devils still have many troubles even now i still dont have any evidence but if we were to believe in valis warning then diodora is looks like we need to do that plan which we discussed after all man i already feel down because of one of the guys
with me had a certain event i heard about it it seems like one of the leaders of the grigori got married man everyone is rushing things not just that but they were having funsex with wome n from different factions behind my back shit am i the only single guy left fufufu how about you settle down with someone now azazel dont wan na im a man who lives by his interests there are plenty of w women yes i will make it that way anyway that plan i trust you in it yeah leave it to me though we would be having them go through harsh things though life3 the great battle part 1 ah ah i im no i am the gremory groups i was sitting in front of the mirror in my room to practice speaking and to smile as well i want to make a big smile but even the practice makes me nervous thats because we will be appearing on television it cant be helped if you want to practice speaking that night buc hou received a call from grayfia san the business she had with us was the television station offered an appearance
on their programme it doesnt end there since it was an offer for the whole gremory group to appear the rating game for the young devil s including buchou has been broadcast to the whole underworld buchou and other young devils were already famous for being family members of the maou and such and it seems their fame increased even more after that game even in the underworld there was an article in a magazine which had a princess rias gremorys special i found out that buchou is popular during summer but that just means she became even more popular for the young female devils the kuoh academy girls uniform is popular so i heard that it would get released for sale in the underworld soon munyuu there is someone hugging me from behind i remember this sensation of oppai when i looked at the mirror its buchou as i predicted what are you doing ise yyes i was practicing b ecause we will be appearing on the television ufufu its alright you can answer normally when they ask you a question the one who would be asked the most questions would most likely be me buchou starts to pat
my head to make me feel comfortable aa ah buchou my onee sama your way to take care of your servant is perfect hey ise you know you dont have to burden yourself that much about asia buchou continues with a gentle tone lately youve been thinking about diodora more than asia has yes i was also thinking about it too but it seemed like you were worried about asia even more do you think its your fault that asia came to this side of the world buchou is amazing i nod my head while looking down yes but asia said she is e njoying the current ways of her life i also think that is for the best but i hug buchou hugs me gently she then says it to my ear ise and i lets make that girl happy with everyone in our group but you and others also have to achieve happiness okay if not then i would get sad buchou i started to man cry with buchous words sob thats because buchou is too kind the woman i fell in love with is an amazing woman i would follow you to the depth s of the
world yes buchou me and the rest of the members will lead a happy life with asia spending our life with a smile that must be happiness buchou then smiles at my self determination yes i know my lovely ise part 2 just like that its th e day of appearing on the television we teleported to the underworld by using the magic circle personally for us i just came here recently so i never thought i would step foot back here this quickly the place we arrived in is the basement of the big building which is built in a city in the place for transport magic circle arrival area we were welcomed with warm arms by the staff we are glad you are here rias gremory sama and her servants sama please come this way we were being led by the person who seems to be the producer and we went to the top floor via the elevator the interior of the building doesnt look different to those in the human world but they are different in very simple things there are many devices that work using demonic power within the building and on the poster placed in
the corridorits buchou the smiling picture of a crimson haired beauty looks like that of an idol then from the end of the corridor a familiar person comes while bringing 10 people with him sairaorg so you were here too yes the one who buchou talked to is the next heir of the house of bael sairaorg san he has the noble jacket rested on his shoulder and he looks wild like always even from a novices eyes he has no openings so hes always rea dy for action huh the blonde woman with a ponytail who is right behind him is his queen she sure is beautiful rias are you also getting interviewed yes have you already finished sairaorg i will be getting interviewed now most likely a differ ent studio from you guys i saw your match buchou raises her eyebrows a bit no matter how much power you have you will lose if you get trapped they will aim for the slight opening with full power above all there are many unknowns in a sacred gear we wont know what will happen and what it can do compatibility is also important in the game i have learnt
many things from the match between you and sona sitri however sairaorg san then pats on my shoulders i desire to fight you with onl y pure power sairaorg san left after saying that my shoulder which was lightly patted he only did that but it feels very heavy do i have some expectations from the number one youth man it makes me nervous after the greeting with sairaorg san we went to the dressing room and left our bags in there azazel sensei didnt come with us because he would be appearing on a different programme irina is staying back at home today its just for us the gremory group after that we were taken to wha t seems like a studio and we went inside they are still preparing and the staff are still doing work the interviewer lady who was here before us comes to greet buchou hello it is my first time meeting you i am the announcer of underworld broadcast studio 1 same goes to you hello buchou also responds with a smile and shakes her hand im sorry all of a sudden but for the interview buchou the staff and the announcer lady started
the discussion about the interview there are also many sea ts for the viewers inside the studio waa so it would be broadcast while having people look at us live crap i started to get quite nervous even if buchou is the main we will also be standing there for the actual thing iiiii ii want to go hooooome gasper who is trembling behind me it must be cruel to have a hikikomori appear on television but im also nervous gasper endure there will also be questions asked for the other group members but please dont be too nervous about it the staff tell us ummm are kiba yuuto san and himejima akeno san here ah that would be me im kiba yuuto and i am himejima akeno kiba and akeno san raise their hands i think there would be quite a number of questions asked for you two for the interview both of you are increasing in popularity are you serious when i make a sound of shock the staff nods yes kiba san is getting more female fans while akeno san is getting more male fans oh hes handsome and shes beautiful af ter all then it wont
be weird if they are popular i see since the match against the sitri was broadcast throughout the underworld kiba and akeno sans popularity rose damn you kiba akeno sani kind of feel complicated she is my other onee sama i didnt know whether i should be happy or not and akeno san then smiles at me you dont have to worry i only have eyes for ise kun so i wont go to another person she then holds my hands gently uoooooo akeno san she sure is an onee sama who thinks deeply of her fellow group member huh i then felt a sharp gaze when i look aroundbuchou is glaring at me and akeno san my master sure has a strict check on her servants and who is the other person hyoudou issei san ah that would be me im also popular im a bitno i feel really excited but the staff puts on a question mark above his head ummm you are seems like she doesnt know me eeeeeeeeh um i am the pawn hyoudou issei im also the sekiryuutei as well when i said that the staff realise it ah you are your armoured form had
a strong impression so i couldnt tell hyoudou san in a normal state certainly in the match i was in the armour form for quite a time it was a blitz8 so it might be obvious if the impression of me in my normal state is weak hyoudou san will also have an interview in a different studio you are famous as being the chichiryuutei9 chichiryuutei what is that i became shocked at the unknown nickname i was given the staff then continues lively you have b ecome very popular amongst children it seems like you are called oppai dragon amongst children you screamed out oppai in the match against sitri correct that was broadcast during snack time in the underworld and it became very popular among the chi ldren who saw that are you serious im a hot topic amongst the brats in the underworld i cant understand it but an oppai dragon ah i think i did keep on saying oppai it seems like children get attracted to those simple things looks like what grasps the childrens attention is the same both in the underworld and human world uuoooooooon suddenly ddraig started crying inside me hey hey hey
what happened i who was called a heavenly dragon i who has been feared as the sekiryuutei hes crying seriously seems like he is really shocked hmmmm well it is chichiryuutei and an oppai dragon after all then hyoudou san please follow me to the different studio i will guide you i received a personal script from the staff and i started cheering ddraig up while i was heading towards the different studio so what will be waiting for me huh man i was nervous after the recording we started relaxing in the dressing room its obvious that everyone was nervous as well so they started relaxing by leaning on the wall or dropping dead on the table as soon as we entered the room the programme was a collection of questions towards buchou from the beginning to the end how was the match against sitri what will you do from now is there any youth devil you have your attention on such questions like that buchou answered with a smile normally and she didnt forget to behave with elegance her family might also watch it so she cant show anything shameful buchou showed us and the visitors an awesome
interview as the next heiress of the gremory then when the questions moved onto kiba after that there were cries of the female fans his popularity among the female audience was the real deal even during akeno sans turn male fans w ere shouting akeno sama and when it was my turn the kids were yelling oppai dragon and chichiryuutei i dont know how to express my feelings but i really was popular with kids it seems like my armour form looks like a stuffed toy to the kids but since i kept on saying oppai and oppai i became popular in a weird way hahahaha there must be a reason why they filmed that in the order studio by the way ise what were you asked to be filmed at the other studio buchou asks while eating a snack its a secret the staff also asked me not to tell people who are close to me as well i said it while making an evil laugh which sounded like nihehe i understand i will be looking forward to it it seems like buchou is also looking forward to it then it happened when we were trying to stand up
to go home the door opened and someone enters i thought she was cute for a moment its a girl who has her hair braided in a roll and shes quite a bishoujo but she looks familiar is ise sama here ravel phoenix what brings you here ravels eyes met mine it seemed like her face became bright for a moment but she then makes an unpleasant expression she then pushes the basket she is holding to me tthis it is a cake my second eldest b rother has a television programme in this studio so i came to give you this since i had time is that so im not sure but i took the basket from her and checked inside a delicious looking chocolate cake is inside wow it looks splendid but why did sh e give me the basket with a shy face it looks good did you make this yyes of course i have confidence if it is cake a and i promised you that i would make you a cake thank you but you could have made it for me when we have tea like we promise d i wont do anything to disturb you
you have a match with the house of astaroth coming up soon correct so i wont waste your time but i thought maybe i can just give you a cake you should be grateful hmm is she forceful or is she modest but i m happy she came all the way here tthen i will be leaving here ravel goes home as if she finished her business wait a sec kiba i stopped ravel and made kiba make a small cake knife i cut a bit off the cake and took a piece of it to my mouth the sweet taste of chocolate spreads inside my mouth it doesnt have too strong of a taste and is just right the softness feels good too its delicious ravel thank you i will eat this at home hahaha i dont know when i will see you next so i thought i will give you the comment for the taste now i will make sure to arrange having tea with you on a different occasion if it is me that you would like to have a drink with though when i said that ravel got teary eyed and her face was red to
the m aximum huh i thought she would respond by saying of course ohohoho ise sama for the next match i will be cheering for you run after ravel said her goodbyes to us she left the scene quickly when i turned around to buchou buchou has he r eyes closed while raising her eyebrows and the girls are looking at me with a scary atmosphere wwhy i became suspicious of this situation but like this our interview finished and the match against diodora was drawing near by the way a video which has me appearing on it was sent to my house by the studio i got shocked when i checked it out i never thought it would turn out like this how should i tell buchou and others part 3 buha in the changing room for the big bath located on the first basement floor in my house i took a gulp of fruit milk after having a bath ah it tastes good i drink it in a single sip while putting my hand on my hip but you know that this big bath is located on the first basement floor right i still cant believe in it
the hyoudou residence which had a major renovation during summer is now six stories high and has down to a third basement the second basement floor has a pool the girls swim in it when they feel like it seriously it really is luxuriou s thanks to that there is enough space for the girls to live in my parents are happy as well so it should be alright and there are all sorts of milk drinks inside the fridge located on the first basement floor so we can drink after having a bath acc ording to buchou drinking a variety of milk after a bath is a must in japan buchous obsession towards japan is scary at times by the way i change the types of milk drink i drink after bathing everyday buchou is in the fruit milk faction akeno san asia and koneko chan are in the normal milk faction and xenovia is in the coffee milk faction i had a bath after the training towards the upcoming game so i feel refreshed i have started to become a training norm lately i dont feel calm if i dont train working hard daily is my routinewhen i
left the big bath room the big hall which is across from the big bath room is titled with light there is a big hall next to the big bath room on the first basement floor so we can do film watching marathons and all sorts of training i was training here just before too the door is ajar so i check inside xenovia is in there wielding a practice purpose sword she is wearing training wear and is wielding the sword seriously ise yo i wasnt trying to peek but the lights were on in this room so i happened to check inside i entered the room practicing yeah since the game is coming up but didnt you train quite a lot before dawn as well yes xenovia increased the amount of training as the ga me was drawing near daily even today she overworked for training and it seems like she was being haunted by something during the spar even kiba seemed like he was being overpowered by xenovias high spirit but since she was rushing things she created an opening and received a counter i am weaker than kiba after all xenovia says it with straight eyes
certainly when we first met xenovia was stronger than kiba but the situation changed all of a sudden because kibas talent started to bloom after he attained holy demonic sword even on the video kiba showed that he could use durandal better than me in terms of simple talents kiba has more talent than me xenovia has cloudy eyes i think there is a part inside her that is a bit jealous of ki ba from my eyes both you and kiba are amazing xenovia smiles at my words which dont even sound like i am cheering her thank you but the thing i cant forgive the mostis myself who lost in the previous match without doing anything thats why i am training so i wont let my guard down any more so it is about that in the match against sitri xenovia lost against shinra senpai who possesses a counter type sacred gear in terms of power xenovia was superior but the timing and compatibility between them was bad so she lost against her i also witnessed how scary a technique type can be when i looked at the video they settled the match in places where pure power
doesnt work and it made me realise how broad the game could become well i do think we are super strong if we were to fight normally oh crap this confidence could lead to our defeat no matter how awesome a power you have i realised that there are many ways for us to get defeated settling the match with pure power seems the most easiest to know though but especially in the game it would be a team battle so rather than having one strong individual we need to cooperate in a style of person a ability person b ability the road to becoming a high class devil sure is har d i sat on the floor and made a sigh it truly is hard to get a promotion to a high class devil do you want to become a maou ise no i never thought about things like that why do you ask all of a sudden in the future you will be going sol o from buchou right to stand at a greater height yeah that is my plan asia said she will be following you hmm aaah yeah we promised we will be together forever take
me along with asia as well an unexpected situation i never thought sh e would say that why do you want to come with me when i ask she answers with a big smile it would be fun being with ise i see its fun huh roger that i will think about it yes i hope you do positively i dont know any plan about the fu ture but building a business with asia and xenovia seems interesting i was thinking while bending my neck and xenovia stops swinging her sword somehow talking to you made the nervousness inside me disappear xenovia approaches me who was sitting dow n and chu she kissed me on the cheek uoooooooo i was shocked at the sudden thing a kiss in the cheek huh its my gift to you should i give it to your lips next fufufu then i will be resting for today now xenovia leaves after saying that i co uld only touch my cheek for the sudden kiss she gave me part 4 its about time buchou says that and then stands up the day of the match we gathered at the occult research club room late at night
asia is in nuns clothing and xenovia is in erotic battle wear and the others including myself are wearing the kuoh academy uniform we gathered around the magic circle located in the middle of the room and are waiting to be transported our opponent is diodora astaroth the noble house where the current beelzebub came from i dont know what kind of power he used but he is a devil who is capable of going at his enemy by himself directly with his enormous amount of demonic power but the game will end when you take down the king in our group there are plenty of guys who wont lose with pure powers if he comes at us well just crush him but i also need to learn a different way to fight other than that a counter huh maybe i should practice it as well sairaorg san is a super power type he is in a similar category to me if i learn to counter it seems like i can turn the tables around for power types the moves of technique types are something you cant ignore while thinking about it with my small brain asia holds onto my
hand nervously i smiled silently and held her hand as well yes first i need to take care of diodora i will definitely not hand asia over to him no matter what kind of demonic power he would use against me i will protect asia then the magic circle glows and we are abou t to get teleported did we arrive when our eyes recovered from the lights made from the teleportation we opened our eyes the place we arrived was a spacious place the place is lined up with thick pillars the ground is made fromrocks we look around and we see a big entrance of a shrine at far huge it looks like those shrines that appear in greek mythology at first glance there are no broken parts and it seems like it was just built the sky is white like always so this is our ba se huh now lets get pumped up for it would it be a blitz or a long battle i still dont know but i will just have to accomplish my role i was getting my courage up like that but we didnt hear the announcement of the arbiter no matter how
much time had passed this is weird buchou says that just like how i became suspicious others are also suspicious with this situation did something happen to the people in charge of the match i was thinking such things and then a magic circle appea rs on the other side of the shrine eh diodora dont tell me we will have a battle with this short distance i panic the group makes their stances but there isnt just one magic circle many lights have appeared and they are surrounding us it i snt the symbol of astaroth kiba says that while making a stance with his sword akeno san then says it while having her hand covered in electricity none of the magic circles are similar except they are all devils but if my memory is correct buchou looks around with serious eyes while being covered in red aura the ones appearing are manydevils all of them appeared with hostility they glare at us while surrounding us one two three no im going to stop counting thats because the y dont just stop at ten or a hundred there are between several hundreds to a thousand of them and we
are surrounded by an insane number of people the whole area is covered with devils that have just appeared judging from their magic circles they re affiliated with the old maou faction of khaos brigade i became scared to my wits are you serious the khaos brigadeeeeee why did they intrude in the game of the youth devils oh they are terrorists after all but why our match the blood relative of the annoying fake maou gremory i will have you perish here one of the devils surrounding us says that to buchou in a provoking way just like i thought for the devils supporting the old maou faction the current maou and the devils who sup port them must be an eyesore kyaa a scream this voice belongs toasia when i turned to asia she isnt there isesan the voice came from above when i looked up i saw diodora who is carrying asia that bastaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard hey rias grem ory and sekiryuutei i will take asia argento with me he said something foolish with a refreshing smile let go of asia you shit coward and what is the meaning of this arent we supposed to play the game diodora
showed an evil smile for the firs t time to my shout are you dumb this isnt a game all of you will die here by themthe agents of khaos brigade no matter how powerful all of you are you wont be able to take on this many number of high class devils and mid class devils right hah ahaha so die perish right away buchou glares at diodora are you telling me you are connected to the khaos brigade scum and you even defiled the game so death would be fitting for you more than that you try to take away my adorable asia away from me buchous aura increases shes pissed of course she would be im also about to snap this guy i just cant forgive this bastard if i were to stay with them then it seemed like i can do anything i want to whenever i want well struggle as m uch as you want i will become one with asia while you are busy with them then you know what i mean sekiryuutei i will make asia mine if you are able to follow me then come to the depth of the shrine you
would be able to see something magnificent while diodora laughs loudly xenovia shouts at me ise ascalon yeah i responded right away i made the gauntlet appear i pulled the sword out from the tip and handed it to xenovia asia is my friend i wont let you do as you want xenovias eyes are also burning with rage she tries to slash at diodora right away but the demonic power released by diodora crumbles xenovias stance her blade didnt reach diodora but the holy aura released from the sword goes towards diodora yes take that thats what i wanted to happen but diodora dodges it swiftly up in the air shit so he wont go down that easily huh looks like getting her stance crumbled was bad isesan xenovia san ise asia begs for help but the space starts to shake and it g ets distorted diodora and asias body get blurry and they start to disappear asiaaaaaaaaaaa i call for asia who disappeared but i dont get any reply shit i couldnt protect asia again i i isekun stay calm we need to take care of the e nemies right in front of us first lets go and
save asia san after that kiba says that to me yeah hes right its simple i need to get past this place go to diodora to beat the crap out of him and save asia diodoraaaaaaaaa i wont forgive you the devils surrounding us so they were serving under the descendants of the old maou i dont know many details about it but i need to beat them up if they get in our way their hands shine mysteriously they are trying to attack diodora said not only do they consist of mid class devils but also high class devils will we able to dodge all of their attacks is it better to hide behind the shadow and take them down one by one or should i ignore them and head towards the shrine while i was thinking up o f a plan i heard a scream kyaa under this tense situation akeno sans voice what happened when i looked a single eyed shitty old man wearing a robe was lifting up akeno sans skirt and looking at her panties hmmm nice butt more than that the curviness only the young ones have is irresistible tthis shitty geezer i pulled
akeno san away from the geezer akeno sans ass belongs to me you shitty geezer where did you pop out from wait you are i was familiar with this old geezer yes after the match with kaichou this geezer visited the infirmary room i was resting in if i remember this geezer is odin sama why are you here buchou asks surprised yes odin the god from the north its the arrival of the god the geezer says it while stroking his long white beard hmm it will be long if i explain it but to put it simply this game has been taken over by the khaos brigade like i thought the whole game was taken over by them the game committee and those from different factions are cooperating to take them on well we know up to the fact that diodora astaroth was allied with the old maou faction behind the shadows he must have received the snake from ophis which resulted in his sudd en power increase then it will be dangerous for you guys right so you needed some help but this game field is covered by a strong barrier so it would be hard for
normal people to break or go through the barrier especially destroying it we cant do a nything unless we stop the one who turned the barrier on from the inside then how did you enter here geezer when i gave one of my eyes to mmisbrunnri10 i became familiar with these types of demonic power magic and other spells the same applies for barriers too geezer showed his left missi ng eye to me something which seems like a crystal is put inside and magical letters glowing in the depth of it are popping up chills when i saw the symbol appearing on the artificial eye i felt as if my whole body froze stiff it has a really danger ous glow i can even feel ddraigs nervousness through the sacred gear the enemy is the chief god of the north our name will rise if we take his neck the old maou faction devils start to shoot the blocks of demonic power at once the number of attac ks is insane when we were prepared to take on the shots aimed at us odin geezer just hit his rod onto the ground once bobobobobobobobobobobobon the attacks coming at us
get reflected away and perish geezer just laughs hohohoho while stroking his b eard this geezer is amazing to be expected from a god he made the attacks perish easily the devils changed their expression there are many high class devils among them but this geezer still has this much confidence normally i can break the barrier with my power but i could only enter here hmm so what kind of enemy did this though i was told by that brat azazel to give this to you to be making an old man work this much what should i do with that brat afterwards this geezer sure does com plain a lot what we received from the geezer are small communication devices go leave this place to this geezer and run towards the shrine im saying this geezer will be standing in the battlefield to cover you guys this is a big privilege you kno w when the geezer points his rod at us a shallow aura envelops us that will protect all of you until the shrine now go go but geezer will you be okay just by yourself i get worried but the geezer just smiles energetically for
a baby who only lived for a decade or so to worry about me something which looks like a spear appears in the geezers left hand gungnir he releases a single blow with it towards the devils then baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang enormous amount of aura is released from the spear and a sound which pierced through the sky echoes throughout the area i couldnt believe what i saw the thick single blow goes straight to the end of the earth and it gouges the ground deeply dozens of devils have perished with that single blow what an intense power its not a matter of fact that it is at a completely different level you know geezers need to work out sometimes too now then terrorist devils come at me with all your might this geezer here is stronger than you can imagine he has this much power even though he held back uwaagods do have a power in a totally different league the devils became even more nervous there arent any devils who would come at us like before to make their name famous anymore i apologise i wi ll leave this place to you buchou gives her thanks to odin the
geezer and then says it to us we will run towards the shrine we responded to buchous words and ran towards the shrine during that time the geezer and the devils resumed their battle when we entered the shrine we put the communication devices we received from the geezer on our ears then we heard a familiar voice are you guys alright this is azazel looks like you received this from that geezer odin its sensei i know that th ere are things you want to say but hear me out this rating game has received an assault from the old maou faction of the khaos brigade the field you guys are at and the special field where the vip room is are flooded with devils from the old maou fact ion but this is something wed anticipated beforehand currently all the factions are working together to defeat the old maou faction so the observers are also having a hard time as well huh more than that what does he mean by saying that hed antic ipated it lately those who are related to the current maou started to die mysteriously the ones who were behind it are the old
maou faction of the khaos brigade it was told that the heir of the glasya labolas died in an accident but in reality it was the old maou faction who killed him so the yankees relative was killed by the khaos brigade was he targeted because he had the same blood as the current maou and the mastermind behind it are the descendants of old beelzebub and old asmodeus just like cattleya leviathan that i defeated the hatred of the old maou faction towards the current devils government is great by terrorising this game they tried to sh ake the world as a start by killing and showing the dead bodies of those related to the current maou there isnt a better occasion to attack than this we anticipated something bad ever since the match between astaroth and agares then it means our matc h was already decided to be targeted by the old maou faction from the beginning the ones who are targeted are maou and their relatives in other words buchou and also the bosses of each faction who came to see the match then that geezer odin was also one of their targets then the reason why
diodoras demonic power increased more than before is buchou asks he must have borrowed ophiss power they also must not have thought that diodora would have used that power during the game thats why by add ing that with the incident with glasya labolas we anticipated that something would happen in this match but they didnt change their plan at all so that shit powered up by borrowing the power of the boss of the terrorists and he won his match with that i dont like this at all to them as long as they can finish us off anything is fine i suppose even for us this is a chance we cant normally hope for its a good time to crush the old maou faction who seems like they will have negative influence on the world odin greek gods and gods from sakras side are also planning to annihilate the terrorists we told the bosses of each faction in secret about the possibility of a terrorist attack occurring and we asked them whether they would participate for this plan all of them decided to cooperate and are thinking about winning right now everyone is rampaging against the old maou
faction devils so all the bosses from each faction are basically saying we wont lose to terrorism huh im sorry r ias i said war wouldnt happen that often but it turned out like this we made you guys face such danger we wanted to have them move before the start of the game we thought they would appear then and like we thought it did but its certain that we se nt you to a dangerous zone i thought of this plan by persuading sirzechs i wanted to bring out the old maou faction no matter what what would have you done if we died in the process i ask sensei without any care and sensei then says it with a serio us tone i was planning to take proper responsibility for it if my life is needed to make up for it then i would have done that sensei was planning to die so he lured those guys out with that much determination that is important but i need to t ell sensei what happened earlier sensei asia was taken away by diodora i see either way i cant have you guys stay there any longer leave asia
to us it will turn into a battlefield over there the old maou faction devils are continuously being teleported there by the magic circle there is a hidden basement in that shrine its made to be very sturdy hide there until things settle down we will eliminate the rest of the terrorists this field is made by the longinus possessor who belongs to the khaos brigade you can somehow enter inside but its near impossible to leave from there longinus dimension lost it exceeds among the sacred gear related to barriers and space so even that geezer odin who specialises in techniques cant destroy it are you also here in the battlefield sensei yeah im inside the field it is a really big field so im far from you guys though we will go and save asia i said it to him straight forward do you know what kind of situation it is right now senseis voice is mixed with anger but i still wont give up there is no way i can i dont understand anything complicated but asia is my comrade my family i want to save her i dont want to lose asia ever again yeah while
we are discussing l ike this we dont know what that bastard is doing to asia just thinking about it is making my stomach burn black buchou then says it with a smile azazel sensei im sorry but we will continue to go forward inside the shrine to save asia the game is cancelled but i wont agree to it if we dont settle this with diodora i need to teach him how foolish it is to take my servant away from me buchouuuuu to be expected from buchou she sure knows what to do akeno san also continues from there azazel sensei we have the right to use our power against those who do suspicious actions within the three great power alliances correct you know diodora showed rebellious actions towards the current devil society oh shes right we have those rights to be expected from akeno san sensei makes a sigh from the other side of the communication device geez you guys are stubborn brats well okay then this time there arent any restrictions that is why there isnt anything which will hold your powers bac k go and rampage to your hearts content especially ise show the power
of sekiryuutei to that traitorous brat diodora oh sensei sure knows what he is talking about thank you very much osu i replied back with high spirit lastly listen to this it is important they started this while knowing that we started to get the gist about their plan in other words their plan is something which wont be affected even with us knowing about it what does he mean i became suspicious but it seems lik e buchou understood does it mean they started the terrorist attack because they have something up their sleeve yeah we dont know what it is but it is certain that this field is dangerous the game has stopped so there isnt any retiring even if y ou guys get in a dangerous situation there is no way to help you so keep that in mind be careful i see the opponents have confidence in themselves so they still proceeded even if their plan was already known to us i dont know what they are pla nning to do but what we need to do is simple and clear we need to beat diodora then save asia and then hide under the basement its
a bit scary that there isnt teleportation for when we need to retire but it would be okay if we beat them before they beat us but why do i have such a high encounter rate to meet strong foes power gathers around dragons i think i heard someone say that before did i end up like that because i am the one who has the sekiryuutei residing in me koneko can you fin d asia buchou asks koneko chan to find asia koneko chan points towards the end of the shrine while having the cat ears appear on her head i can sense asia senpai and diodora astaroth from there yeah wait for me asia i will go to your aid soon all of us then ran towards the depth of the shrine part 5 inside the shrine was a spacious place it feels like there is no end to the spacious hall there are just giant pillars inside the shrine and nothing else is there when we go through the shrine another shrine appears right ahead so we go towards there when we kept on repeating that we felt a presence within one of the shrines we stopped
and made our stances the ones who appeared are ten people with small builds who are wearing robes hey rias gremory and her servants diodoras voice echoes throughout the shrine where is it coming from hahaha sekiryuutei you wont find me no matter whether you look around or not im waiting at the end of another shrine for all of you lets play a substitute for the rating game that has been cancelled the bastard says some rubbish like that is he sending his voice using demonic powers and he wants to play what is he trying to do lets have a match while using our pieces the rule is that you cant use the same pieces again until you reach where i am at other than that anything is okay for the first match i will be sending my 8 pawns and 2 rooks by the way all of my pawns have promoted to a queen hahaha its 8 queens f rom the beginning but that is okay right after all rias gremory is a young devil famous for possessing powerful servants hes insane hes telling us to take on all the pawns who have promoted to a queen
and 2 rooks if i remember correctly all 8 of his pawns are girls man hes lucky a harem no no this isnt time for being jealous of diodora fine i will play along with your nonsense i will carve into your head just how powerful my group is buchou affirmed seriously is she okay with it is it okay to agree to the enemys suggestion when i ask buchou she says it while narrowing her eyes we should agree to it they have asia as their hostage yeah we wont know what they will do if we provoke them buchou then points at me we will have ise koneko xenovia and gasper head out shes telling to go past this with us four i think we are lacking quite a number those who were just called come over to me i koneko chan xenovia and gasper gather around buchou and she whispers to us i will leave the 2 rooks to xenovia you can fight with all your might so use your full power against them roger that i like it im good at those things oh you seem like you will be enjoying it xenovia san but shes
right if she has no restriction then she seems like she can even beat 2 rooks she is originally a power type against the pawns koneko would be the attacker use the senjutsu to send your ki in them so you can take them out ise and gasper will be konekos sup port but you two will be the key for this battle ise please have gasper drink your blood roger heeee roger roger that buchou we nod at buchou but i was called back by buchou ise you know yes yesw what i started trembling at wh at buchou just said to me are you serious its okay right i really can do it right i tried to get a confirmation from her for the last time and she nods yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i scream within myself the fear i had just before is now gone i can do it i can we can win against these guys then lets start along with diodoras words his servants made their stance towards us i had my finger cut lightly by kibas demonic sword and gave my blood to gasper heartbeat i knew that gaspers heart jus t got a pulse the next
moment gaspers body is covered in a weird aura his red eyes start to shine mysteriously as well yeah the atmosphere of gasper changed with this we are fully prepared when xenovia releases her durandal she makes a double swo rd stance along with ascalon and she walked towards the 2 rooks i will take asia back an intense pressure never seen before is coming out from xenovia her eyes are sharp i never had someone whom i could call a friend thats because i thought i could live without such people i thought i could live if i had the love of god dash the 2 rooks sprint towards xenovia fast so they are rooks with speed xenovia doesnt even flinch and continues talking to herself then those who started to treat me in a friendly manner came especially asia who always smiled at me she called me her friend yeah you are our comrade and also our friend xenovia she shows sad eyes while dodging the rooks attacks when i first met asia i said horrible thing s to her i called her a witch i called her a heretic but asia came and talked to me as
if nothing happened she even called me her friend xenovia so she always thought about it thats why i will save her my best friend asia i will save her don a destructive wave is released from durandal and it blows away the two rooks when xenovia swings her durandal up high she shouts with a teary voice thats why i beg you durandal respond to me i wont like it if asia disappears if i lose asia i please give me give me the power to save my friend durandaaaaaaaaaaaaal dooooooooooooooooon as if it responded to her words durandal increases its aura by several times what an intense amount of aura even i who isnt receiving the a ttack can feel it itching my skin durandal is glowing ten times more than before amazing crumble crumble the area around xenovia starts to crack with just the holy aura durandal is naturally emitting i realised lately that i cant suppress durandal very well it might take a lot of time for me to get the silent wave of aura that kiba showed then i just have to keep on going forward i decided to increase the sharpness and the destructive
power of durandal instead xenovia made a cross with duranda l and ascalon up the air durandals wave is transported to ascalon and the holy aura increases even more ascalons aura also increases its holy power because it has come in contact with durandal the aura emitted from the two swords starts to make a syn ergy now lets go durandal ascalon lets go to save my best friend please respond to my feelinnnnnnnnnnnnngs durandal and ascalon start to create pillars of light a big hole is created on the ceiling of the shrine xenovia swings that towards the two rooks baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang the two big waves of holy power merge and enveloped the two rooks doooooon the shrine vibrates violently when the vibration stopped what appears before my eyes is the two big slashes that appeared in front of x enovia the pillars that were there before are now gone along with the wall even the ceiling above xenovia and onwards is gone more like the majority of the shrine disappeared with the waves created from the two holy swords so this is the attack power o f xenovia without any restrictions and all of that was the holy power
if the opponents are devils then it would be a deadly attack no its not something so nice like that they will disappear without a trace the two rooks did perish when i saw those two rooks on the video they didnt seem weak instead they seemed quite strong and she took them out with a single blow xenovia is breathing heavily so continuous use of that would be impossible she accomplished her job now it is our turn koneko chan gasper lets go yes yes good reply nyan koneko chan let her cat ears and tail appear with that sound yes both her sound and cat ears are so cute that blood will burst out from my nose our opponents are eight pawns who had all promoted to queen they might be the most fearsome but there is a way to win first i will also promote during the game i can only promote if i go to the enemy base but since the game is off now i can promote to queen with buchous authorisation thats why i promoted to a queen quickly boost i then used boosted gears power explosion i gathered the demonic powers to my
brain i will release it once again this ability which was once sealed evil passion released image max spread my pleasant d ream field a mysterious space appears around me buchooooooooou i am a hentai and a pervert even so i will use this power for you no i will use it for myself after pledging to buchou i made a lock on to the eight pawn girls ahead to their brea st i will try to ignore that buchou had an astonished face just now pailingual yes my special technique has caught them they wont be able to get away from this technique the real game starts from here hey all the pawns oppai san tell me what you are going to do starting from the right oppai i close my eyes and speak to the oppai then their oppai starts to speak in a way only i can hear first we will get rid of the troublesome vampire lets take him down with the three of us at once vampire we must defeat defeat wow i open my eyes and told the other two what i just heard that girl that girl and that girl are aiming for
gasper gasper stop the ones i just told you yyeeeeeees gasper stops the three pawns that i poin ted at with the power of his sacred gear stop the three pawns were grasped by gaspers eyes and their movements were sealed easily yeah they stopped gasper who drank my blood is doing alright next i ask the other pawns on the other side what are y ou guys thinking about woah those girls were stopped then they will find out that we are aiming for the nekomata dont tell me this is the rumoured power of the dragon who can hear the voices of oppai scary i was planning to target the nekomata dont tell me it was useless to use a defence spell to stop my heart from being read the nekomata will find out about our plan i see these three are after koneko chan impertinence wait they even made a plan to stop their heart from being read wel l they would do that since they wont be able to come all at once since im here gasper next those three will head towards koneko chan stop them there yyeeeeees stop gaspers eyes glowed and now those
three stopped there are only two pawns le ft that was settled in an instant it really did finish quickly uhahahahahahahahahahaha we are overwhelming the eight pawns who promoted to queen are now crumpled on the ground because of our super combo i released an evil and vulgar laugh it is fu n this really is fun i can understand the movements of my opponents only limited towards women and if i use it with my comrades it is the ultimate combo attack if you can read their heart then you will know their movements if you know their movemen ts then i can tell that to gasper and stop them them in their tracks gasper doesnt have that much battle experience so he cant use his sacred gear more sufficiently because he wont know what the enemy would do but it is a different story if you know their movements diodora must have miscalculated he didnt know how elegant my move can be if my opponent is limited to women even im shocked at how well this works it even works against those who cast a spell on themselves to stop me reading their h eart ah i dont
actually read their hearts directly but speak to their oppai maybe that minor difference led to their spells not working two enemies left they became scared at our combo and are backing away kukuku you girls must be scared for your attacks to be seen through and to be stopped no matter how i think about it you act like the villain auu i received harsh words from koneko chan yes it certainly is i also think that but it is needed for victory i must be inhuman this is al l to save asia so i will listen to the voices of oppai no matter what i walk slowly and lightly touched the pawns which are stopped rip rip rip then the robes were blown away and they became fully naked arara bishoujo chan i couldnt see their faces because they were covered by hoods but diodora also gathered a fine looking group of girls i cant forgive him even more but this girl sure has a nice body bu i laughed almighty while having a nosebleed i also touched the other pawns which are stopped and destroy their clothes this one has big breasts save to my brain
save completed since they have been stopped i can do whatever i want to them fufufu look for those who cant move to become this defenceless i can destroy their clothes easily as well the combo of pailingual and dress break i never thought i would become this invincible if my opponent is a girl i started getting scared at my possibilities i never thought i would attain such power at the depth of my sexual desire when i look the two pawns are trembling they will have their breasts read they will be stopped and they will have their clothes destroyed and have their naked bodies seen there is nothing more humiliating for a girl sensei i started to think i can conquer breasts inside me i felt as if azazel sensei said those who conquer oppai will conquer the world11 yes sensei i will conque r oppai now what will the remaining girls do for me aye i started moving the fingers of both hands while putting on a vulgar smile punch then i received a punch to my face by koneko chan ouch it hurts koneko chan lets defeat them quickly super lecherous senpai koneko chan started
defeating the pawns which are stopped by punching them i then gave gasper an order immediately and made him stop the remaining pawns i sure cant win against koneko sama i will defeat the opponents like she s ays then like i thought if it is limited to women my pailingual and gaspers combo could be called the ultimate phew we claimed the first victory i koneko chan xenovia and gasper defeated 8 pawns and 2 rooks easily i thought we were at disadv antage before the battle but when we battled them we got the complete victory we are amazing without any restrictions just like sensei said but like sairaorg san said we will lose without doing anything if we fall into a trap the battle has many dep ths if there were guys among the pawns then we would have had a really hard fight im glad diodora is a pervert all the pawns were girls because that guy is a pervert i can understand his feelings though the pawns who couldnt move got their demonic powers sealed by koneko chans senjutsu and were made to lose consciousness by gaspers vampire abilities so that we can tie them
to a pillar with this the enemy has the queen 2 knights 2 bishops and diodora left they have full members the ones who havent fought from our side are buchou akeno san and kiba lets get going we then moved onto the next shrine with buchous words then the ones who are waiting for us next are three enemies if my memory from the video is correct they are the tw o bishops and the queen kiba says that how did kiba determine that they all wear the same robes so i cant tell the differences can you tell from their heights or from the quantity of their demonic powers but they are sending the queen for the second battle but just like in the first match is it diodoras strategy style to send his strong servants from the beginning the remaining two knights are nowhere near kibas level when i saw them on the video we were waiting for you rias gremory sama diodoras queen takes of the hood and reveals her face oh a beauty a blonde older woman her blue eyes are beautiful i think one of diodoras bishops is a girl and the other is
a guy but both of them are wearing hoods so i cant see their faces from the video the supporting skills of the two bishop are splendid in terms of demonic powers they are superior to gasper and asia in terms of support though i think our bishops are superior after all we have the healer and the time stopper the p roblem is the queen this queen san was fighting against the queen from the house of agares head on and she won in the end i remember that her fire demonic powers were amazing araara i will be going then the one who took a step forward is akeno san so akeno san will be going ahead i see the remaining two knights would be enough with just yuuto i will fight as well and buchou too the two great onee sama have lined up together ara buchou it would be enough with just me what are you sayi ng even if you learnt how to use holy lightning overdoing it is a taboo you know rather than receiving damage here its better to go at them with more power to minimise our damage the holy lightning and
the power of destruction they are both powerfu l and both will be used together like i thought i can sit back with relief if it is these twos combo koneko chan then pokes me hmm what happened koneko chan she tells me to bend down and then whispers into my ear yes yes i see hmm just that yes akeno san will power up with that hmm i dont really understand but if it is koneko chans suggestion then i might as well say it akeno san i called her and she turns around hmm if you were to defeat those people with ease lets go on a date next sunday will this really work koneko chan i dont think akeno san will get stronger with just having a date with me buzz buzz buzz electricity started sparkling in this area when i looked at akeno san akeno san is enveloped in aura of holy lightning ufufu ufufufufufufufufufu i can have a date with ise kun holy lightning is coming down in the whole area while she puts on a smile with intensity you are horrible ise you have me and yet you only ask akeno out eeeeeeeeh t
his time buchou makes a claim at me with teary eyes i really dont know what is going on ufufu rias this is proof that my love has finally been received by ise kun seems like you have to give up now yes wwwhat are you saying i dont want it to be said from the vulgar akeno who sparkles her lightning from just a single d ddate huh huh huh it seems like buchou and akeno san have started a quarrel what did you say i dont want it to be said from you who doesnt seem like you will be getti ng love12 from him anytime soon tthat is not true e even a while ago he what happened a while ago he touched my breast a lot on t he bed isnt it just that ise kun had a bad sleeping posture and that happened we also k kissed twice ah buchous tone just now sounded insanely cute she was acting completely like a normal girl then i will tongue kiss him right now thr ee times right in front of you rias akeno no no i dont even want to imagine your tongue going inside that
boys mouth his mouth belongs to me what kind of things are you discussing my two onee sama are they still quarrelling about me as their servant hmmm i feel happy but also embarrassed even the enemy queen and bishops look confused and dont know how to respond but it seems like the queen couldnt endure this situation so the queen got enraged while covering herself with an aura of fire you two stop this for gods sake dont ignore us for fighting over a man shut up shut up dooooooooooooooooon buchou and akeno sans especially huge attack is released at the queen and the bishops the power is so incredible that it gi ves me chills just by looking at it the power of destruction and holy lightning was released at the same time and it takes out the enemy even the surrounding scenery is destroyed smokesmoke the queen and the two bishops are on the ground w hile smoke is coming from their bodies no matter how you look at itthey wont be able to fight anymore and this is the result of interfering in their argument it would be weird if its coming from me but it
was a horrible match more like it is scary to make the two onee sama angry and their quarrels havent ended to begin with do you even know all of ises body akeno i know it even to the tiniest details you know you just know it but you havent touched it or received it rias is always talk im already prepared to accept him whenever and anywhere nggggggh well i will stop at there i will discuss this with you slowly after we save asia asias rescue comes first yes i know asia chan is like a little sister to me too oh both of them have finally got the same opinion after we defeated the queen and two bishops we went further into the shrine part 6 asia chan i will be going to see the sports festival with otou san we will record your appearance at the finest moment haa the part where asia chan is running she sure must look cute a bit before the rating game started my mum and dad were checking the camera while smiling several months have passed since asia started living in my house mum and dad treat asi a like
their real daughter and adore her geez dad and mum are treating asia like their real daughter now looks like there is no place for me i said it to mum ara thats because asia chan is much cuter you should know how it feels to have a lecher ous son like you asia chan on the other hand heals our heart yeah yeah its just like mum says damn it my mum and dads love to me feels like it is somewhere really far i am a lecherous high school student just like they say asia gets red in the face and says it timidly i grew up not knowing my real mother and father i do think if i had a real mother and father would it be like this when i am with ise sans otou sama and okaa sama no it must be a bother for a home stay like myself to think like that dad then says it to asia directly i think of asia chan as my real daughter mum also smiles gently so do i asia chan even we thought we were bothering you because we thought of you like that see we

asias ho use too lets go home with me and everyone i will i will definitely rescue asia part 7 when we stepped foot in the shrine where diodoras knights are supposed to be waiting someone familiar appears before our eyes ya it has been awhile the white haired priest freed yes the one who appeared in front of us is that shitty priest its been a while since i last saw him i havent seen him since the excalibur incident so he was still alive huh you thought this guy was alive right ise kun yes yes im so stubborn that im alive very clearly you know stop reading through my mind geez this guy sure knows how to read my mind but where are the two knights i thought they would be here more like why is freed here hmm are you perhaps looking for the two knights his words as if he read my mind once again his sickening smile sure does disturb me freed chews with his mouth and spits something out when i lookit is a finger i ate them what is this guy saying ate them i became suspicious but koneko chan narrows her
eyes while covering her nose that person has quit being a human koneko chan says that with disgust he makes a big smile and makes a laugh which is impossible for a human hyahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahah right after i was slashed down by you guys i was retrieved by that shit valiiiiiii and i got fired by that rotten azazeeeeeel bon guun while making a weird sound parts of freeds body start to swell up it rips the priest s clothes and something which looks like it may be a horn or not starts appearing on his body his whole body starts to increase in size and his arms and legs get several times thicker the ones who picked me up after i lost my place are the guys from k haos brigade they they said that they would give me powers and what did i geeeeeet kyuhahahahahahahaha to turn me into a chimera fuhahahahahahahahahaha a single bat wing appears on his back and a gigantic arm also grows from his back too his fa ce also changes so that it lost its original form and in his mouth which is opened wide sharp fangs appear his face looks like that
of a dragon how can this be his arms his thighs his whole body is in a mess his whole body doesnt even have p roper balance in looks what kind of brain would you need to change a person into something like this the giant creature before me doesnt even resemble freed even the other group members have a disturbed look so this guy had his body modified by the k haos brigade but this this is just too horrible hyahahahahahahahahaha by the way did you know diodora astaroths hobby that is his hobby is beautifully crazy and just listening to it makes your heart beat suddenly freed started talking about dio dora diodoras taste in women that rich boy certainly has great taste apparently he has fetish for girls affiliated with the church yes the ones you call nuns taste in women nun i then matched those words with asia freed continues while having a smile and the ones he preys on are the passionate and strong believers do you know what i am trying to say his servant devils that ise kun and others defeated just earlier are all former believers of the church the same could
be said for the girls w ho are at his house all of them are famous nuns and holy maidens from various areas his taste is really something dont you think the devil rich boy seduced the women from the church and made them into his toys oh wait thats why devils exist he sp eaks with sweet words to the passionate holy maidens and makes them fall for him i guess thats what you call a devils whisper wait then asia was freed laughs loudly at my words the one who wrote the scenario of asia getting kicked out of the church is none other than diodora astaroth the scenario goes like this one day a devil rich boy who loves to have sex with nuns found himself his very ideal bishoujou holy maiden he couldnt help but wanting to have sex with her ever since he saw her but he thought it would be hard to take her away from the church so he used a different plan to make that girl his hold on a sec w wait so asia was the holy maiden is a very very kind girl i got advice from someone who is
knowledgeable wi th sacred gear that the sacred gear possessed by the holy maiden can even heal devils so the rich boy put his attention there maybe she will get kicked out of the church if another believer sees her healing me even if a scar is left it would still be alright if i can have sex with her thats how that rich boy lives i dont regret saving him back then i got a flashback of asia saying that with a smile what the fuck is that seriously what the fuck is this freed then laughs again as if he wants to piss me off even more she will get exiled from the church which she believed in then her life will get ruined and she wont believe in god and then she will come to me thats what he was thinking hyahahaha even the painful experience fo r the holy maiden is a spice for that rich boy he will save them from the depth of despair and then rape them he will rape both their body and heart and that was the best and ultimate entertainment for him he had been raping and making the girls
from the church his own and he wont be changing even from now so the rich boy diodora astaroth kun is a devil who loves to fuck strong believers of the church hyahahahahaha i i couldnt keep down this feeling i have in me from my fists blood is dr ipping because im clinching it tightly i glare at freed and tried to take a step but kiba grabs my shoulder isekun i know how you feel but you should keep that feeling for diodora astaroth he says it calmly but instead that ticked me off are y ou telling me to be silent about i became pissed and tried to grab kibas collar but i stopped my hand after seeing kibas face thats because kibas eyes are filled with anger and hatred i will fight i will stop that vulgar mouth of his kiba g oes past me with intensity the aura coming out from kiba is filled with such a strong hostility that it cooled down my anger kiba stands in front of freed who turned into an abnormal shape and he creates a single holy demonic sword in his hand hey hey hey you are the rotten
knight san who cut me down back then thanks to that i went through a lovely model change like this but you know i also became quite a lot stronger i even ate diodoras two knights easily i also got their traits as well so now im an invincible monster so lets get along casanova that guy actually ate the knights kiba then says it in a cold tone with few words it would be better if you dont exist anymore dont get all cooooooocky freed who turned into a monster with rage starts to have many blades coming out from his body and is coming this way swift kiba disappears from my sight cut then the monstrous freed who is in front of us is cut into pieces what the heck you are too overpowered freed who only has his head rolls on the ground while his eyes are wide opened he was defeated in a single attack he finished the battle when freed was about to attack he must have slashed him in godspeed uwaa i couldnt foll ow him with my eyes hihihi well you wont be able to stop diodoras plan or defeat the guys behind
him more than that you dont know the true horror of longinus possesors hyahahaha stab kiba stabbed freed who only had his head left he finished hi m off he gets rid of the blood right away by swinging it in the air the blood spilt makes a circular mark on the ground you can continue howling to the grim reaper in hell this guy even said a finishing quote shiiiiiiit even a guy such as mysel f thought he was cool did this guy get stronger again i couldnt even tell freeds strength at all but i do understand that kiba was overwhelmingly stronger than freed freed i had an inseparable relationship with him but his last moment is something i cant describe with words this guy was also a victim in some way maybe no this isnt the time to think about it right now asia is the priority lets go everyone we then ran towards the last shrine where diodora is waiting diodora i will neve r forgive you ouroboros i azazel have taken care of quite a number of devils from the old maou faction in the rating game field the rest of them should be
easily taken care of by my subordinates i left the rest to my subordinates and flew up the sky heading towards to a certain location the jewel which has fafnir residing in it is reacting towards this way when i immediately teleported here with odins power along with my subordinate the jewel inside my stomach when i saw a person at the corner of the field the jewel increased its brightness i then stood in front of that person a little girl who has her black hair down till her hips she is wearing a black one piece and you can see her thin limbs the little girl has a gracefu l face but she is looking at the centre of the field which has many shrines lined up i sharpen my eyes and then say to her i never expected for you to come here personally the girl reacts to my voice and then looks at me she laughs lightly azazel it has been a while didnt you have the appearance of an old person before now that you have the appearance of a bishoujo sama you definitely have my respect what are you plotting ophis yes she is
the ouroboros dragon ophis the boss of t he khaos brigade no mistake about it the creepy aura which you can not describe only belongs to ophis the last time i met her she was in the form of an old man but this time she has the appearance of a black haired girl well to her appearance is only a decoration she can change as much as she wants if she came here personally then that means this terror is that much more important to her observing just that only sight seeing from such a good place aye but for the boss to appear huh will t he world be peaceful if i defeat you here i said it with a bitter smile while pointing my spear of light at her but she shook her head impossible azazel cant defeat me she said it clearly like i thought i wont be able to defeat her by myself i know that but its certain that the khaos brigade will get critical damage if i defeat her here then how about with the two of us the one who came down while flapping his wings isan enormous dragon tannin the former
dragon king tannin this guy also was involved in eliminating the old maou faction within the game field but it seems he came here after he finished his work tannin glares at ophis with his big eyes the young devils are betting their future and they are standing on the battlefie ld i dont like the fact that you came to interfere in it for you who didnt take any interest in the world to become the boss of the terrorists what made you become like that i also nod at tannins opinion and i also ask her killing time dont tell me such a dull reason like that because of your actions there are casualties in each area yeah since she stood on the top of the terrorists she lent her power to all types of dangerous guys and it brought casualties to each of the factions the number of people getting killed increases day by day its so serious that we cant ignore it anymore what drove her to act and make her stand on the top of the terrorists i just couldnt understand that why did the ultimate existence who stayed silent about the world decide to
act now but ophiss answer was something i couldnt accept the silent world for a moment i didnt understand what she said huh i ask her once again then ophis looks at us straight and says it again i want to return to the dimensional gap and attain silence that is the only reason shes saying thats her reason the dimensional gap to make it simple the human world and the underworld the human world and the heaven the dimensional wall which exists b etween them the boundary which separates the world nothing exists there and it is called the world of nothingness i knew she was born there but i would laugh because your reason is being homesick but the dimensional gap huh if i remember over there at the dimensional gap ophis nods at my words yes great red is there right now the dimensional gap is in the control of that guy i see ophis wants to get rid of him so she can return to the dimensional gap dont tell me with that req uirement the requirement to get rid of great red was the reason why she placed herself with the devils from the khaos
brigade and other dangerous guys from the different factions then i thought of a single possibility in my head i get it now vali yo ur objective that is when my mind was trying to make up a conclusion a magic circle appears next to ophis and someone teleports here the one who appeared is a man wearing the clothes of a noble that guy bows at me and puts on a smile it is my first time meeting you i am the one who carries the blood of the true asmodeus creuserey asmodeus i came here to ask you the governor of fallen angels for a battle as i am the member of the truemaou faction of the khaos brigade hahahaha look what we have here its the appearance of one of the masterminds i said it while scratching my head looks like the asmodeus of the old maou faction showed himself don before i confirm his identity he had the demonic aura around him running through his body the colour is deep black so this guy also received ophiss power its not the old i am the blood inheritor of the true maou i will avenge cattleya leviathan
right here is he cattleyas man or something well it doesnt matter if i can defea t the mastermind of this terror then i cant ask for anything more so i will have myself accept his challenge fine then tannin what will you do im not a rude guy who would interfere in a one on one i will have myself watch over ophis this guy really is a warrior its a waste having him as a dragon i leave it to you it has got chaotic but its about time my students reached diodoras place safely i slip that out of my mouth but ophis shakes her head when she heard that i also gave my s nake to diodora astaroth if you consume it your power increases drastically defeating him wont be easy hahahahahahahhahahahahaha i laughed out loud at what ophis just said she doesnt know you really dont understand ophis why laugh i said i t to ophis who tilts her head snake huh that seems powerful but unfortunately that wont be enough why my snake it grants enormous power if you consume it even so that wont be enough in the game before due to the
rules he couldnt use his power completely the training with tannin how serious that is diodora astaroth will find that out with his own body dragon king as his training partner even if he is the former dragon king a legendary dragon that is still active was chasing around a single brat even though he held back you would be dead normally dying in the process would have been normal but he endured it he returned alive and reached balance breaker you guys still dont understand what that means i took out fafnirs jewe l and made a stance with the artificial sacred gear now fafnir i will have you tag along with me our opponent is cruzerey asmodeus lets go balance break next moment i was covered with golden plate armour ise there is nothing which is restrain ing you here now so rampage when i was trying to show off like that a magic circle intrudes us that crest is i see so you will come out personally and the one who appears from the magic circle is the crimson haired king sirzechs sirzechs why did you come he narrows his eyes to my question for this plan
i got my little sister involved in the political matters of us adults so i need to come forward as well i thought it would be bad if i leave everything to azazel every time i want to per suade cruzerey if i cant even do that then i wont be able to face my sister man this guy really is you are such a mr nice guy you know it will be a waste even so i wanted to ask them directly as the current king of the devils i pulled away my spear the moment he saw sirzechs cruzereys expression turns to that of rage sirzechs the hated fake existence to appear here personally because of you because of you guys we look this is the reality to them your existence is t he one they hate the most cruzerey can you lower your weapon down if it is now i can still prepare for negotiation for having the descendant of the previous maou be further away from the spot light and drove them to the corner of the underworld eve n now i think maybe there was another way at times i want to prepare a negotiation
with the descendant of a former maou more than that i would like you to talk to the current maou asmodeus falbium sirzechss words are polite thats why it ticked off cruzerey instead its useless sirzechs to begin with your words as the current maou wont reach these guys you are nave cruzerey then gets enraged dont speak nonsense not only the fallen angels but you have allied with the angels so i don t want to hear you who have become a filth talk about devils not just that but are you telling me to talk to the impostor that is enough with your nonsense i made a sigh and said it to cruzerey like you are in the position to say that you guys t he khaos brigade have the dangerous heretics of the three great powers gathered he makes a smile we are not cooperating we are using them the hated fallen angels and angels are beings who are only tools that we use understanding each other peace all existences besides devils must be destroyed why cant you understand who devils are no we the maou are the ones who have to become the kings of the
world by using ophiss power we will destroy the world and create a new world of devils for that you impostor maou are in our way ah this is bad its the mind of bosses of grunts that comes up in books the devils are already in danger of continuing their kind already so what are they thinking sirzechs you might have mixed feelings but yo u are doing a better job as a king you know because oldmaou were like these guys the devils were heading to the path of self destruction their thoughts their beliefs they do not match the gap between both sides is big and it will never get fixed s irzechs then says it with sad eyes cruzerey i just want to protect the seeds of devils i need to protect the civilians or else our kind will not prosper i dont care whether you call me nave i want to lead the children with the future we dont need war in the current underworld nave more than that it is a foolish reason do you think that will be the end of devils devils steal the souls of humans we lure them to hell
and we exist to eliminate god and angels there is no need for negotiat ion anymore sirzechs the fake king with fake kindness a lucifer a maou they are a being who annihilates everything even though you have the power of destruction why dont you use it against the fallen angel beside you like i thought you dont h ave the right to call yourself a maou i cruzerey asmodeus who am the true maou will annihilate you that was the end of sirzechs who is the current maou and the descendant of the old maou sirzechs then speaks to ophis ophis is a negotiation with you also impossible only if you consume my snake and make an oath to me one more thing hand over the ownership of the dimensional gap around the underworld i will take all of it obedience and closure of the underworld huh there is no way a maou who carries the underworld on his back will accept that easily sirzechs looks up and closes his eyes when he opens his eyes his eyes are filled with coldness which gives me chills after confirming that cruzerey distances himself and creates large bl ocks of demonic
powers in both of his hands yes thats it that is easier to understand sirzechs cruzerey was hoping for this the whole time sirzechs there was no way that your words would have reached him from the beginning even so you still wanted to talk to him huh your thoughts and the thoughts of the underworld that is sirzechs puts his right hand forward and then he pointed it up demonic powers were gathering there sirzechss demonic power starts to give an irregular aura the pow er of destruction sirzechs then says it with a strong tone cruzerey i will eliminate anyone who becomes a threat to the underworld as a maou you dont you dare use the name maou cruzerey releases huge demonic powers from both his hands sirzechs doesnt flinch and changed the demonic powers in his palms to several smaller spheres and then he shot them forward bang guuuuun cruzereys demonic power perishes after it touches sirzechs demonic power as if it was ground away the demonic power released by sirzechs moves as if it has its own mind and eliminates cruzereys attack sirzechs himself dodges or uses defensive spells for the attacks which couldnt be eliminated
one of the spheres of power of destruction goes into cruzereys mouth don cruzerey swells up once when it calms down at the same time his demonic powers decrease drastically did sirzechs get rid of the snake cruzerey consumed sirzechs then says it rune the extinct i got rid of ophiss snake in your stomach with t his you wont be able to fight with enormous power by having the snake which is the base of his power up destroyed his confidence from earlier disappears and now he looks impatient sirzechs attack its my first time seeing it one of the reasons wh y sirzechs was chosen as a maou overwhelming power of destruction it eliminates everything it touches it doesnt even leave a trace absolute destruction even if it was small it has outrageous power he didnt overuse the absolute power of destructi on he didnt even increase its mass he kept it in a small size and he is able to control several of them like his own limbs a technique which requires delicate control and a great level of talent sirzechs has those damn you just like you and just like vali why do those who carry
the name of lucifer are blessed with powers yet both of you clash with us cruzerey tries to release more shots while cursing kuuban but one of the spheres touches cruzereys stomach and it takes away his whole s tomach even if small the power of destruction has enough power the moment it touches it it eliminates everything in its surroundings w why why does the real one have to lose against the impostor while having blood coming from his mouth cruze rey sheds tears of blood sirzechs closes his eyes and swings his arm to the side slowly that moment cruzereys whole body was eaten away by several spheres floating in the sky life4 i love y ou the place we arrive in isthe shrine located at t he deepest end when we go inside there is something that looks like a gigantic device its a circular device which is carved into the wall there are jewels located in various parts and it also has mysterious symbols and letters in it is this portraying some sort of magic circle then i scream after i saw the centre of the device asiaaaaaaaaa asia is tied to the centre of the
device judging from her looks she doesnt have any wounds her clothes dont seem ripped either im glad looks l ike she has no wounds you finally came the one who appears from the side of the device is diodora astaroth his gentle smile increases my anger i started my count down for balance breaker when the countdown ends i will punch diodora with full power in full speed i will pierce through that guys face ise san asia looks this way after hearing my voice her eyes are swollen she was crying and her eyes are so red that it tells me that she shed an abnormal amount of tears when i saw that i t hought of a sick conclusion diodora did you tell asia about the whole thing the thing freed told us before something we must not have asia hear but diodora just smiled at the question i gave him yeah i told everything to asia fufufu i wanted to show it to you as well the moment she had the best expression the face she had when she found out everything was going according to my plan was simply the best look i even left
the video of it should i play it she really had a splendid face the expression of the women affiliated with the church falling no matter how many times i see it i never get bored of it asia started to sob but i think its still lacking asia still has hope inside her yes im talking about you guys especially the filthy sekiryuutei over there because you saved asia my plan turned into a failure that fallen angel womanraynare i was supposed to appear and kill raynare after she killed asia once and i was planning to give my evil piece then i thought you wouldn t win even if you were to interfere then i found out you are the sekiryuutei its an interesting occurrence thanks to that my plan was postponed quite a lot but she finally returned to me now i can enjoy asia shut up even i couldnt believe how low my tone was i did think he was a villain something you would call my instinct it is a vague expression but i felt the same thing i felt from riser coming from him as well no that isnt it hes not a villain
but a scum who far surpasses a villa in no hes a brute a shit like this was talking about love to asia i am even more raged than the time vali said he would kill my parents even when i was already at my limits of endurance diodora wont stop his sickening words asia is still a virgin right i like to train them from virgins and i will hate it if she was already used by sekiryuutei this guy ah but maybe it might be fun to ntr13 from the sekiryuutei i cant keep calm unless i beat the shit out of this guy maybe it would be good to forcefully have sex with her while she screams out your name shut upppppppp welsh dragon balance breaker something expl oded inside me diodoraaaaaaaa you you are the one person i will never forgive i got engulfed by the red aura and i was now enveloped by the plate armour which has the power of sekiryuutei in it maybe the sacred gear responded to my feelings i turn ed into balance breaker before the two minutes countdown buchou everyone please dont interfere ise we will defeat him together thats
what i would like to say but it looks like we cant stop you you cant hold back okay buchou gave me the best reply yes thats what im planning on doing ddraig can you hear me what is it partner let me do as i want just for today alright seeing me diodora laughs with joy his whole body is wrapped in a deep black aura ahahahaha amaz ing so this is sekiryuutei but i also powered up with the snake ophis gave me that is i can kill you instan gooooooooooooooon i ignited the fire from the boosters on my back and closed our distance with an instant dash bang i punched sharply into diodoras stomach before he could finish his sentence gaahah diodoras body bends his face gets distorted to that of receiving intense pain it seems like he couldnt react to my speed i push forward my fist and tried to destroy his insides gough diodora vomits things inside his stomach along with blood i ask while pulling back my fist and the instant kill you were talking about diodora steps back while holding on to his stomach his expression doesnt have the confidence he had
before ku with something like this im a high class devil the blood relative of the current maou beelzebub diodora puts his hand forward and makes many bullets of demonic powers there is no way that a noble high blood like myself will lose to a lowly fil thy and vulgar reincarnated devil like you diodoras infinite number of demonic powered bullets showers down on me like rain drops i just walk towards him without dodging it i deflect the bullets with my hand and i close my distance with him even if the bullets hit my armour i advance forward without any care thank you old man tannin that torture isnt something which only became useful the enemy is supposed to be stronger than buchou but his attacks arent scary at all thats right the trai ning with the dragon king trained you quite a lot in the match against sitri you couldnt show the result but with no restrictions you can release your power the durability of the armour is more stable than that time in the match against sitri yeah d draig i couldnt use my full power in the fight against saji but its different now
and with this guy as my opponent i can hit him with the intent to kill in terms of simple battle power you are quite the opponent right now when i came right in fro nt of him diodora stops attacking and tried to make a distance gon i ignited the boosters on my back and caught up to diodora immediately then he created many defence barriers it looks thinner than valis barriers break my fist breaks all of his defence barriers with ease hit then a punch to his face i finally did it there isnt a hit which makes me feel better than this because of the impact of being hit diodora slams on to the ground his face is bleeding and he also had tears in his eyes it hurts it hurts it hurts why my demonic power hit you i was supposed to have had my power increased drastically with ophiss power i lift diodoras bodyand hit him with my fist covered in aura a strike to his stomach guha gaha then a strike to his face its not over yet i gathered the aura to my right hand and i tried to hit him with
the enormous amount of aura i wont be defeated by a damn rotten dragon like you diodora put his left hand forward and creates a thick wall of aur a bang break break my fist hit the wall and my impact was stopped this what can this possibly do ahahahahahaha did you see i have higher demonic power than you there is no way that a power idiot sekiryuutei can defeat me i then used the powe r of sekiryuutei in front of diodora who is smiling how about i show you the power of the power idiot then boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost gooooooooooooooooooooon intense amount of a ura burst out of the booster and the impact of my punch increases bang a small crack is made on the wall and then break the wall perishes with my fist which increased its impact sorry im a power idiot so i can only use my power like this but i f you are my opponent then this should be enough hee diodora changed his expression right away dont make our asia cry i released my punch at him while shouting crush
i crushed and bend diodoras left hand which was put forward and from there i directed my fist towards his face hit my fist nailed into his face with my strike diodora flies back and crashes against a pillar diodora who fell on the ground gets up and then shouts this must be a lie there is no way i will be beaten i won ag ainst agares im also planning to win against bael theres no way i will lose to the untalented heir of the great king gremory who holds affection cant even be my opponent im diodora from the house of astaroth when diodora puts his hand upwards ma ny circular sharp things made from demonic powers appear around me the sharp objects all point towards me and come at me like missiles i wont be able to dodge all of it i lower my head down or i jump to the side to evade it but there is a limit to it i fend the sharp objects with a punch or kick the tip of it bends and it wraps around me as if it has its own will crack it goes around me finding the
thinnest part of the armour and it destroys it to pierce my body shit it hurts so he gathere d the demonic power to the tip and opened a small hole on my armour with it since he cant take me on from the front he decided to aim for the single point huh but not yet i used both my hands to pull out all the sharp object at once because i pul led it out by force my blood spills on the ground diodora tries to do the same attack again so i used my booster to shorten my distance with him and released my kick crush a sour sound echoes throughout the shrine my kick hits diodoras right thigh and it seems like it crushed his bone daaaaamn itttt diodora who put on a painful expression points his hand towards me and started to gather demonic powers immediately hes trying to shoot the demonic power with his utmost level i also directed my hand towards him i gather dragon aura to my hand dooooooon a red light shoots out from my right hand and a massive demonic power is also shot from diodoras hand dooooooon our shot
collides and pushes against each other but with something like this you wont be able to stop me goooooooo boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost the power which has been increased by my sacred gear passes on to it and the power of my dragon shot increas es don my dragon shot blows away his shot and it skids through along his side my dragons aura which went past him creates a huge hole in a section of the shrine it pierces through the wall and goes outside even so he still tries to gather demonic powers dooooooooon i slammed my fist against the floor the shrine itself vibrates his eyes twitch when he sees the giant crater on the floor diodora is trembling while his teeth chatter i missed on purpose i could have hit him with it shit im too soft hearted i walk to him and pull him up i then open the mask part of my helm and glare at him with my face exposed while emitting my red aura violently dont ever get near asia again the next time you show yourself before us then that time
i really will blow you away diodoras eyes get dyed with the colour of fear partner his heart is already crushed his eyes are that of those who have become ingrained with the fear of dragons i see ddraig i let go off diodora he is just sha king like mad ise arent you going to finish him off xenovia asks me while pointing ascalon at diodora her eyes are dangerously cold this is bad her killing intent is at the max he might approach asia again dont you think it will be better for the future if we cut off his head here xenovia is serious if either me or buchou agrees she will decapitate diodoras head but i shook my head to the sides this guy is also a relative of the current maou even if he assisted the terrorists it wou ld cause trouble to buchou and buchous brother if we kill him i already beat him enough buchou raises her eyebrows and then closed her eyes buchou was incensed at him but she must have decided to let the higher ups handle diodoras punishment xenovi a seems very regretful but then stabs down ascalon on to
the floor she did that to get rid of even the slight anger i understand if ise is saying that then i will stop but yeah thats right xenovia and i point our sword and fist towards diodora dont ever come and talk to asia again with our words filled with intensity diodora shakes his head numerous times while having eyes full of fear when we let diodora go we walked towards asia asia along with me the other guys also g athered around the device isesan i pat gently on asias head we came to rescue you asia hahaha i did promise you that i will definitely protect you maybe because she felt relieved asia starts to shed tears of joy its okay after we rescue a sia we will escape to the basement of the shrine and wait until sensei and others take care of everything but after a while kibas expression changes i cant take off the restraints on her limbs what impossible i tried to take off the restrai nts connecting asia and the device shit it wont come off it cant be pulled of even with my power of sekiryuutei all of us try to
take off the restraints on asias limbs even if we try to cut them off with holy demonic sword or holy sword or even by using demonic powers it wont even budge what is this restraint is it specially made then diodora said it with a very small voice its useless that device can only be used once due to its mechanism but its made that it wont stop unless you use it once it wont stop unless asias ability is activated what do you mean when i asked he answers timidly that device is one of the special barriers created by a longinus possessor the strong barrier protecting this field was also made by hi m dimension lost is the ultimate barrier type sacred gear having the possessor in the centre it spreads an unlimited amount of mist it can seal everything inside its zone and it can even teleport it to a different dimension when it reaches balance breaker it changed its ability in which it can create any type of barrier device the possessor wishes with the mists dimension create the barrier made cant be stopped unless it is activated once properly kiba then questions diodora whats
the req uirement for activation and what is the ability of this device the activation requirement is either i or someone affiliated with us gives the signal to start or if i was to be defeated the ability of the barrier is to increase the power of the on e in the restraint in this case asia and reverse its effect reverse hold on then i thought of a bad conclusion in the match against sitri asias healing ability was reversed and kiba seems like he also realised it and he questions him again what about the range of its effect this field and the viewing room where the observers are present at everyone got shocked at that answer this is bad asias sacred gear ability to heal is enormous it can even heal devils and fallen angels if that was to amplify and be reversed and if the range of its effect is this field and the observing room the leaders of each faction might be eliminated we turned blue at the shocking truth if that happens all of the human world underworl d and heaven will be in serious trouble so they thought of a plan like that
with the match against kaichou diodora shook his head to my doubt no it seems like the possibility of it was predicted quite some time ago except since the ones in the s itri group used it the plan was proved to work buchous face turns into that of anger the traitor in the fallen angels remained in the organisation and let sona borrow reverse so they gathered data from it and might have been using them hous e of glasya labolas the match against sitri diodora so khaos brigade was behind all this shit so this device made from the longinus is someone affiliated to khaos brigade huh ddraig cant you do something about this you are also a longinus right no dimension lost is a higher rank longinus than the boosted gear and if it reaches balance breaker its near limitless please remember it longinus more powerful than the boosted gear exists of all the places why is that bastard with such a power ful sacred gear in khaos brigade shit damn it what should we i became frustrated and slammed on the floor and then asia says isesan destroy this along with dont say something stupid if
you say that again then i will get pissed i wont forgive you asia even if it is you bbut at this rate sensei and michael sama willwith my power if that was to happen i would rather i put my hand on asias shoulder and say it straight to her i i i made an oath that i won t let asia go through sadness again thats why i wont let you do that i will protect you yeah i will i will definitely protect asia i cried but im serious i will definitely protect asia isesan asia also became emotional and she started sh edding tears i then said it to asia with a smile thats why lets go home together mum and dad are waiting at home lets go back to our house guuuuuuuun the device is activated silently shit it finally started we shot demonic powers and dragons p ower towards the device again but it was unscratched so this is the power of a longinus which is ranked higher than the boosted gear no wait i then thought of something i look at asia yeah its directly attached to asia ddraig i believe in y
ou what do you mean partner ddraig asks with wonder and i then touched the restraint on asia if its impossible by using ddraigs power directly how about a special move in which i use ddraigs power on my imagination asia i will apologise befo re hand eh asia tilts her head adorably but this is all for the sake of saving asia im sorry rise my sexual desire my worldly desire dress break balance breaker boost version boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boo st boost boost boost boost boost all the jewels on my armour glow red and the power flows to my hand which is touching the restraint what i imagine is asias naked body yes the appearance of when she was born wearing nothing i saved that on my brain before i remembered that and imagined strongly while getting a nose bleed the sensitive and smooth white skin a soft body a beautiful one the pink nipplessssssss then break break tear the sound of metal breakingand the sound of clothes being blown away the restraints on asias limbs are blown away and at the same time her nun outfit is blown away too iya
asia ducks down immediately nosebleed seeing asia chans naked body which is still growing i had blood coming out from my nose yes even today asia chans oppai are white and beautiful guuuuuun maybe its because asia was released from the device the device also stops ara ara akeno san made asia wear clothes right away using her demonic power buchou then knocks on my armour and then asks how did you come up with the idea that dress break can destroy it can that destroy anything which is attached to the womans body iim not actually sure but the restraints were on her wrists and ankles so i thought maybe it would be counted as one of her clothings i then remembered about asias naked body within my head and imagined seriously that i want to turn her into that state maybe it wouldnt work if i did it normally i think i succeeded because i was in balan ce breaker state and increased it with the boost version it feels like i cleared the grey zone i made a bad explanation like that but i think thats how it is even buchou tilts her head saying hmm maybe
ises imagination and wild ideas were also a f actor for it anyhow asia is safe i also destroyed the device diodora is also disheartened and we are all doing well my wild delusion saved my comrades yeah then its mission accomplished isesan asia asia who is in new nun costumes hugs on to me sobits a shame that im being hugged while im wearing the armour but im glad asia is back i believed in you that ise san will come to rescue me of course but im sorry you heard something painful right asia shook her head to the sid e and then says it with a smile im alright i was shocked that time but i have ise san with me sob she is such an adorable girl mou your brother isnt going to let you marry ever i will adore her while she is with me xenovia also had teary eyes asia im glad if you were to disappear i asia smiles while wiping xenovias tears i wont go anywhere since ise san and xenovia san will protect me yeah i will protect you definitely oh best friends are hugging asia and xenovias friendship is so
beautiful kiba and i fuck i definitely dont want to hug him buchou san everyone thank you very much for doing this for me asia bows and everyone responds with a smile this time buchou hugs her and she then says it with a smile asia its okay for you to not call me buchou at home you know you can think of me as your older sister yes rias oneesama buchou and asia are hugging its an emotional scene im so glaaaaaad im so happppppppy that asia senpai returned gasper is also crying a lot ah hes even getting his head patted by koneko chan ah looks like we can return home safely the device is destroyed so this should be the end maybe i should deactivate my armour once we hide in the basement it might b e better to stay in this form till the last minute it would be scary if someone comes and attack us now asia lets go home yes but before that i need to pray asia seems like she is praying something to the sky asia what did you pray for asia then says it shyly its a secret asia runs towards
me while smiling flash then something very bright appears when i looked asia is surrounded by pillars of light when the pillars of light disappeared asia no one was there lord can you please listen to my wish please protect ise san forever and also please allow me to continue living with ise san juggernaut drive part 1 we didnt know what happened for a moment no even now i still dont know what happened isekun defeated diodora astaroth and destroyed the device made by a longinus and we rescued asia san safely i kiba yuuto and the group were trying to leave this place then that moment asia san disappeared inside a bright light what just happened an ob ject made from a longinus perishes from the attack of a longinus huh damn mist user he eased up its necessary to readjust the plan an unfamiliar voice when i looked at the direction it came from an unfamiliar man was floating in the sky hes wear ing light armour that had a cape on it what is this amount of aura which feels like it froze the core of my body buchou then asks that man who are you
its my first time meeting you sister of the annoying fake maou my name is shalba beelzebu b the true successor of the great true maou beelzebub im different from the relative of the fake one you fought earlier diodora astaroth i lent you my power and look at the situation you are in in the match against agares you used ophiss snake with out my authorisation and had the enemy predict our plan you are very foolish indeed old beelzebub at a time like this seems like the mastermind of this terror that azazel sensei mentioned has showed himself then diodora astaroth begs the descendant of old beelzebubshalba beelzebub shalba please help me if it is with you we can kill the sekiryuutei if the old maou and current maou were to join forces stab a strike of light which was shot from shalbas hand pierces through diodoras ches t pitiful i even told you the power of that girls sacred gear and yet you couldnt do anything that explains how useless you are shalba says it while laughing diodora turned into dust and perishes the power of light an ability which is similar t o that of angels
and fallen angels or does the khaos brigade have research on how devils can use the angels and fallen angels power i then saw a unfamiliar device on shalbas arm is that the source which created the light then asia san has really it looks like everyone else realised it too xenovias body trembles with rage now sister of sirzechs it may be sudden but i will have you die here the reason is simple that is to destroy every blood relative of the current maou shalba says it wi th a cold voice his eyes are also filled with hatred he must have a huge hatred towards the current maou authority and nobility and the seat of maou was taken away from him and they were pushed away to the end of the underworld so their hatred must be very deep so you mean to kill glasya labolas astaroth and us the gremory shalba narrows his eyes with buchous words that is correct it is simply displeasing we the true successors to be called the old by you people the relatives of the cu rrent maou and it is something very hard to endure shalba made a sigh our
plan ends with this it is our defeat i never thought that a boosted gear a mid tier longinus would win against the dimension lost a high tier longinus i can only say that this was something we didnt anticipate well we got significant results for future terrorism so i have to be satisfied with it cruzerey died but it wont be a problem as long as im active we can still progress even without vali the true beelzebub is great now as my souvenir while returning sirzechss sister i will have you dead you dont challenge the current maou directly but kill their relatives what cowardice thats alright i will kill the family of the current maou first it won t mean a thing if we dont have them taste despair scum most of all the crime for killing asia i absolutely wont forgive you buchou rages and she increases the red aura around her body to the limit akeno san also puts an angry expression and s he started to wear the holy lightning on her whole body i also dont plan to forgive him asiasanwas finally able to conclude with her whole past the one she loves
ise kun ended it by breaking the obstacle she was finally able to resume with her cu rrent happiness and the one in front of us took her away from us the crime for killing our important comrade he wont be able to repent even with the cost of his life but i will have this terrorist die right here asia asia isekun calls for asia san while walking unsteadily on his foot asia where did you go hey lets go we are going home dad and mum are waiting i if you hide then we wont be able to go home hahaha asia sure likes to play around isekunstarts to look around for asia san while walking weakly on his foot asia lets go home now there is no one here anymore who would bully you even if there was i would beat them up so lets go back asia we still have to do the three legged race for the sports festival i wasnt able to look at him seeing that koneko chan and gasper kun started crying akeno san also looks away and tears are flowing out from her eyes buchou is hugging ise kun gently i
also couldnt stop t he thing coming out from my eyes buchou i cant find asia even though we are finally able to go home we still need to hide under the basement sensei told us but if asia isnt here d dad and mum said asia was their daughter asia also said dad and mum are like her real parents as well she is my she is our important family isekun says it with an emotionless face and buchou gently strokes ise kuns cheek i wont forgive you i wont forgive you i will cut you i will cut you up a nd kill you xenovia slashes at shalba with durandal and ascalon while shouting futile guun shalba reflects the two holy swords with a defence barrier and shot a demonic power bullet to her stomach don xenovia falls on the floor the holy swords w ere also pushed away and it stabs into the floor return asia she ismy friend she is my kind friend she was kinder than anyone why even though xenovia was slammed to the ground she is trying to find the holy sword which i s away from her and then grips onto it
shalba then says it to ise kun vulgar reincarnated devil and the dragon which is the same as garbage the princess of gremory seriously has bad taste indeed that girl disappeared beyond to the dimension her body should have perished by now it means she died then ise kuns gaze locked onto shalba who is floating like that he continues to look at him he looks bizarre he continues to look at shalba emotionlessly rias gremory leave this place at once i f you dont want to die then it would be better to leave here immediately ddraigs voice he emitted a sound so even we can hear him leave what does he mean buchou also put on a puzzled face like me ddraig then directed his voice to shalba the de vil over there shalba was your name right isekun pushes buchou away and stands up you isekun heads towards shalba while walking like a ghoul when he went underneath shalba ddraigs voice comes out from ise kuns mouth his sound that doesnt have any slight emotion gives chills to my body made the wrong choice dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo n the shrine shook violently and ise kun starts to emit a
blood like red aura that aura starts to rise and it gets bigger it started to dye the whole area inside the shrine red i can understand from the quality of the aura i can feel with my skin that aurais dangerous from isekuns mouth a curse like chant is emitted the voice isnt just that of ise kun young old ma le female a creepy sound which is mixed with voices of several people i who is about to awaken it started looks like it will start am the heavenly dragon that has stolen the principles of domination from god it was always like that no matter what thats not right it was like that every time i laugh at the infinite and i grieve at the dream the one the world seeks the one the world rejects i shall become the red dragon of domination it was always power it was always love you guys choose destruction no matter how many times isekuns armour starts to change it became more sharp and it grew large wings from both hands and feet claw like things appeared on the helm many horn like things appeared that appearance is a dragon
itself and then from all the jewels in its body a mixed scream like voice of the old the young man and woman is emitted and i shall sink you to the depths of crimson purgatory juggernaut dr ive gooooooooooooooooooooooon isekuns surroundings were blown away the floor the wall the ceiling all of that is destroyed by the blood like red aura emitted from ise kuns armour gugyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah isekun makes a beast like roar and stands with his four limbs at the spot while moving his wings cut the sound of the wind so fast i couldnt follow it with my eye nggggggggh i heard sh albas scream when i turned around ise kun who turned into a miniature dragon is gnawing on shalbas shoulder a mouth like thing appeared on his helm so he must have bitten using that fang munch munch munch munch the sound of flesh getting torn apart damn you shalba creates a light with his right arm and tries to release it towards ise kun but from one of the jewels a dragon arm covered in red scales appears and stops shalbas right arm then from another jewel a blade appears and cuts
of f shalbas right arm guu shalba shows an expression of pain his blood spreads around the floor of the shrine gunch while making a creepy sound ise kun bites off shalbas arm and descended to the floor when he comes down with his limbs he spits o ut the flesh from shalbas shoulder the red armour mixes with shalbas blood and it was giving off a creepy brilliance gegogyuuga gyhugohaaa guooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooo hehas already lost the voice of a human on all of the jewels which are shining either a dragon arm or blade grows out from it and it started to turn into a shape which has lost the form of a human dont screw around with me the enraged shalba wh o descended to the ground releases an attack of light with his remaining left arm then sekiryuuteis wingglowed with light it looks like that of hakuryuukous wing the moment shalbas pulse of light was about to hit divide divide divide divide divide divide divide divide that sound echoes and the pulse of light halved and halved again it didnt know when to stop halving and shalbas attack became so weak that it was like penlight this
isthe power of hakuryuukou that ise kun stole before he can even use it at this high level valis power damn you how many times do you have to stand in my way valiiiiiii shalba roars but instead of releasing a light this time it was the pulse of demonic power huge enormous amount of aura g oes toward ise kun slide isekun moved its direction just by flapping his wings he fended of such a powerful attack with just that but does shalba beelzebub hold a grudge against vali the descendant of old beelzebub and old lucifer maybe due to t heir standing point there must be a rift what then i realised the change in ise kun the mouth on the helm of sekiryuutei opened wide a laser cannon thing appears from inside it then a single laser piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii the red laser comes out fr om the mask and it goes straight to shalba blowing away his left arm the power of the laser doesnt stop and it leaves a skinny line on the wall floor and ceiling of the shrine then doooooooooooooon an explosion happened from a far off place smoke appears and spreads dust everywhere nuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
isekun makes a roar and when he covers himself with enormous amount of aura a hole is made to the floor and it turned into a huge crater just by exposing his aura it seems like it will blow aw ay the surroundings yyou monster a are you telling me this is the juggernaut drive this is no joke m my power should have been raised to that of the former maou due to ophis power he has surpassed the boosted gears specs recorded in the data shalbas expression finally turns into that of fear his eyes are dyed with fear and looks at ise kun as someone he should fear we could only stand there and look in a daze buchou has her eyes opened wide and her whole body is trembling akeno san xeno via koneko chan and gasper kun are looking at ise kun with fear my body also couldnt stop trembling that is a monster that isnt ise kun anymore ise kun sekiryuutei started to change his stance it spread its wings and looked directly at shalba slide a sound of something sliding when i looked the chest and stomach part of the armour opened and
something that looks like a launcher shows up doooooooooooooooo after the silent vibration a red aura gathers to the launcher that starts to get bigger and the aura is compressed and is charging at the launcher the wings which are spread to the sides are glowing red and the creepy red colour spread around the area ku i cant die in a place like this shalba tries to draw a magic circle with his remaining leg but that leg was stopped you stopped it my leg the eyes on the armour shone red are you telling me it activated an ability similar to gasper kuns sacred gear boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost longin us smasher it echoes through the shrine numerous of times the sound coming from sekiryuuteis sacred gear then from the launcher that has been charged an enormous amount of red aura is shot this is bad at this rate we will also get dragged int o it buchou lets retreat
at once we have to evacuate from this shrine isei buchou walks towards ise kun craving for him but i stop her my apologies i hold buchou in my arms and ran akeno san lent her shoulder to xenovia and koneko chan and gasper kun follow after me baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang iimpossible i the true successor of the true maou i still havent made a fool out of vali yet beelzebub is greater than lucifer curses a mere dragon red dragon wh ite dragoooon shalba gets enveloped by the red aura that was shot and he disappeared into the light along with the shrine part 2 when i got out of the shrine i created many holy demonic swords to make a shelter and had everyone evacuate in it when i confirmed that the sound of the shrine crumbling stopped i released the swords and checked outside the shrine is completely destroyed the device made by the longinus is still remaining but it had broken parts everywhere and has many cracks as well sekiryuuteis power can be this powerful oooooooooooooooooon isekun stands on the shrine which turned into a ruin and releases a sad echo towards the sky even if he lost
himself he still has the sadness of losing asia san within h im shalba beelzebub and diodora astaroth are no longer alive the fight is supposed to be over yet ise kuns armour shows no sign of disappearing what should i do what should i do to make ise kun return to himself including buchou the whole group can only just look at the roaring ise kun looks like you guys are in trouble huh a new person then a crack is made in the air from the crack the one who appeared is hakuryuukou vali and also the man wearing ancient chinese armour its my first ti me seeing him but he must be sun wukong and another unfamiliar man wearing a business suit the sword this man is holding has a great amount of light i have never seen before i knew right away the man ise kun met the wielder of the holy king sword col lbrande vali buchou gets shocked at valis appearance but she made a stance to attack immediately we also made the stance to battle too but i couldnt sense hostility from them i have no will to fight i just came to
observe sekiryuuteis jug gernaut drive that is but by looking at it it seems like he went through an incomplete juggernaut drive you are lucky that juggernaut drive occurred within this specially made battlefield if this had happened in the human world the urban areas and it s surroundings might have vanished buchou asks vali this form is he able to revert from it since it isnt a complete juggernaut drive there would be cases where he can revert but there will also be a case where he remains like this trimming hi s life and die either way staying like this for long would put hyoudou isseis life in danger so it is a dangerous form after all then bikou walks towards me he was holding onto a familiar girl here she is part of your guys group right this healing sister the girl who bikou handed over to me isasia san asia asia chan buchou akeno san and everyone else gathers around asia san from the looks of it she had no external wounds it seems like she is unconsciousbut shes breathing shes breathing everyone got in tears with my answer even i have tears coming from my
eyes im glad im seriously glad but why when i ask the wielder of collbrande answers we were investigating the dimensional gap around here by chance then this little lady came flying into the dimensional gap vali said he recognised her so we brought her here she was lucky if we werent there by luck this girl would have been exposed to nothingness and would have perished i see so thats the r eason but im glad that asia san is safe uwaaaaaaaaaaaaan xenovia confirms asia sans safety and maybe she felt relieved so got on her bottom crying i put asia san down on where xenovia san is she hugs on asia san with a lot of care and is sheddin g tears of joy whats left now is ise buchou looked towards ise kun ise kun is still continuing to roar because of the sadness of losing asia san is he able to revert to himself if we tell him about asias safety vali shook his head to the side t o buchous suggestion its dangerous you will die though i wont stop you from doing it akeno san and koneko chan approach vali i know we are
not in a position to ask but please please help us save him if its you the hakuryuukou can you not f ulfill the role to bring back his consciousness please we will also help using our full strength so please let us borrow your power to bring him back both of them are thinking deeply about ise kun i thought vali would decline right away but he s tarts to think about it yeah it would work if there is something which will stimulate his heart wouldnt it be okay if we just show him oppai bikou says that while scratching his head i also thought that was the best method but i couldnt let i t slip out of my mouth not if hes in that form what always calmed down a dragon was a song we dont have such a thing and a song for the sekiryuutei and hakuryuukou doesnt exist there is a white winged angel flew towards us while speaking ove r vali its shidou irina san haa i finally arrived wait thats ise kun i heard it from michael sama and azazel sama but such a serious thing was actually happening getting shocked and
to be in high spirits like always shidou irina san has su ch strong emotions irina why are you here when xenovia asks irina san pushed forward the holographic projector its the one used by devils the fact that ise kun went into a dangerous form is already known by the vips who are at the observation ro om and at this field so they thought leaving it like this isnt a good idea maou lucifer sama and azazel sama made me carry this secret weapon by the way the one who teleported me here is odin sama he sure is amazing the god from the north and he ha s a huge beard her spirit is so high that it destroyed the atmosphere here i dont actually get it but if it is something prepared by onii sama and azazel then we can depend on its effect buchou took a breath and then pushed the button thena huge holographic vision appears to the sky ah ise kun also looked that way then something which surpassed our anticipation appears from the vision oppai dragon now starting when ise kun in an armour form appears on the vision and says thatchildr
en gathered around him oppai children in the vision around him said that loudly ise kun and the children started dancing then a casual music started ise kun and the children started to dance along with it letters appears on the sky the title and the lyrics of the song appeared everyone had their eyes pop up at the shocking happening what is this the song of oppai dragon lyrics azazel composer sirzechs lucifer choreography serafall leviathan there is an oppai loving dragon living in th e edge of a certain country the dragon goes for a walk when the weather is good dragon dragon oppai dragon grope grope suck suck pafu pafu there are so many types of oppai but he likes the big ones the best the oppai dragon also flies today in an edge of a certain town the oppai dragon was laughing even in a stormy day the oppai dragon becomes happy by pressing oppai dragon dragon oppai dragon click click zoom zoom iyaaan he has seen lots of oppai but he likes big ones the best oppai dragon also pushes today everyone was dumbfounded we didnt know how to respond i then understood this is
most likely the video taken at that television studio looks like the filming when only he was asked to come was a childrens music programme and the name of the song is the song of oppai dragon they filmed it by having ise kun using his balance breaker and made him dance with the children seeing this video im really shocked and the ones who made the songs are what are you people seriously doing this is just horrible uuuoppai isekun held his head down and he actually said a proper word wait why oppai no he isnt proper after all he responded buchou sheds tears of joy no he actually responded to a song like this koneko chanhad her ears facing down and seems heart broken shidou san can you play the music one more time irinasan accepts buchous request yes leave it to me the resume button for the holographic projectile is pushed there is an oppai loving dragon living in the edge of a certain country the dragon goes for a walk when the weather is good dragon dragon oppai dragon grope grope suck suck pafu pafu there are so many types of oppai but he likes
the big ones the best the oppai dragon also flies today uuuoppai gropegrope sucksuck isekun started to groan while holding his head down in an edge of a certain town the oppai dragon was laughing even in a stormy day the oppai dragon becomes happy by pressing oppai dragon dragon oppai dragon click click zoom zoom iyaaan he has seen lots of oppai but he likes big ones the best oppai dragon also pushes today z zzoom zoomiyaanpush isekuns finger is making a posture of finding something sharp claws have dis appeared from his fingers looks like it will work now vanishing dragon balance breaker vali turns into balance breaker immediately wearing a white armour he gets closer to ise kun while flapping his wings and shortens his distance in god spe ed divide the sound of hakuryuukou which echoes through the area at the same time it feels like ise kuns power reduced quite a lot vali must have touched ise kun at the speed of light and activated his ability it was thought to be impossible befo re but because of the music ise kun started getting his consciousness back and worked now rias your nipples are what
he is looking for eeeh buchou gets so shocked that her eyes were about to pop out with akeno sans words akeno san continues wi thout any care isekun reached balance breaker by pressing your nipples then the opposite effect must work as well we couldnt approach because he was covered with a dangerous atmosphere but it is a different story if isekun started regaining his con sciousness with the song bbut will ise really revert back from juggernaut drive with my nipple he will its impossible with me fufufu roles like these suit you better that makes me a bit jealous akeno san puts on a sad face but the thin gs she is saying is nipples this and nipples that that is just absurd buchou glances at vali but vali had sweat coming from his forehead and looked away it seems he doesnt want to get involved with us any longer that is harsh bikou is holding o n his stomach and cant stop his laughter from coming out yeah laugh all you want we can only laugh at this ise kun how much of an oppai dragon can you be buchou took a deep breath and she
looks like she is determined okay she walks towards ise kun she doesnt have the slightest hesitation in her steps is that really okay buchou is it just me or lately you dont think twice when it is about ise kun while the song is getting repeated buchou shortens her distance with ise kun and she finally stood in front of him she unhook the buttons of her uniform and then her bra we arent able to see from this angle so rest assured buchou mmyo oppai isekun found what he is looking for and then takes his shaking fingers towards buchous breast s during that the song was played again dragon dragon oppai dragon click click zoom zoom iyaaan he has seen lots of oppai but he likes big ones the best oppai dragon also pushes today next moment ise kuns armour disappeared and he was released are rias gremorys breasts like a control switch for hyoudou issei vali asks that with a serious face but bikou replies by saying hey isnt that just too mean and was laughing out loud i dont care what happens anymore isekun you are a sple ndid oppai dragon life5 the great red
hmm huh what is going on when i opened my eyes i wasnt in balance breaker form anymore i was confused when i found myself being hugged by buchou and akeno san who are in tears i dont quite remember but according to kiba i went berserk and defeated the guy called shalba yeah i dont remember that at all wait isnt the girl xenovia is hugging onto asia why vali rescued her kiba points at vali ah so vali was here wait why s he here and why is he smiling when i asked for the reason i found out that vali came here by coincidence but im glad asia is safe asia asia when i called out her name asia opens her eyes slowly huh ise san oh shes okay im glad my asia cha don i was about to hug her but i get pushed away by xenovia asia xenovia hugs onto asia oh my shes crying like mad xexenovia san whats wrong i its hard to breath asia asia asia asia asia asia asia you and i will always be friends friends forever thats why please dont leave me again asia pats gently on xenovias head
yes we will always be friends im so glad irina who was besides me started nodding her head down while crying looks like case closed i m ade a sigh of relief then vali comes to talk to me hyoudou issei looks like you are alright yeah looks like i caused you trouble well it may be alright at times more than that its about time look up the sky i was in wonder but i looke d up the white sky of this battle field then break break a gigantic hole was created in the sky then something appears within from it that i became so shocked that my mouth dropped open because of what i am seeing from the thing which appeared from the hole vali says it while putting on a smirk look carefully hyoudou issei that is the one i wanted to see a gigantic creature a true red coloured dragon appeared in the sky swimming magnificently huge hes much bigger than old man tanni n it easily exceeds hundred meters vali continues while narrowing his eyes there are two dragons called the red dragons one of them is the ancient dragon from wales residing in
you welsh dragon the sekiryuutei 1 hakuryuukou 2 also comes from the same origin and the same myth b ut there is one more red dragon that is the red dragon which is recorded in revelation 3 revelation the true god emperor of red drago n apocalypse dragon the great red its the great dragon which is called the true dragon it chose to live in the dimensional gap and swims there for eternity today we came here to confirm that the field of the rating game is inside a section in t he dimensional gap by putting on a barrier this time ophiss true aim was to confirm that shalbas plan was something which wasnt important to us but why is it flying in a place like this no idea there are lots of opinions about it that is op hiss aim and the target i wish to defeat valis target that time vali showed the clearest eyes ever seen before the one i want to fight the most the apocalypse dragon great red who is called dxd dragon of dragon i want to become the tru e god emperor of white dragon it wont look good if the
white is a rank below the red when there is the ultimate class for red right thats why i will become one one day when i defeat great red so that is valis dream so this guy also has a dr eam so the reason why he put himself within the terrorists is so he can fight that huge dragon i know hes doing bad things but after hearing his dream i realised he has a thing called a dream as well great red it has been awhile near us a bla ckhaired little girl wearing a one piece was standing there who is that girl she wasnt there before vali makes a bitter smile after seeing her ophis shes the ouroboros shes also the head of khaos brigade are you serious that is the b oss more like what is she doing here dont tell me shes here to fight me the small girl made a posture of shooting a gun using her hands at great red i shall definitely get my hands on silence flap this time a sound of the wing flapping don it seems like something heavy fell down as well what is it this time
wait its sensei and old man tannin sensei old man oh ise looks like you are back to normal i was scared about what would happen to you but i knew that you will revert b ack to normal from juggernaut drive with that song and womens breasts you are the big idiot who reached balance breaker by pressing womens tits after all looks like it wasnt a waste that i made the lyrics for that song that song was filled with dr eams but that is too horrible by the way the offer came from sirzechs that guy and serafall were so eager in it that they composed the music and even made the choreography for it sensei even i was shocked when i found that out afterwards you can s ay that it is the joint product of the devils world and the fallen angels world the old man also laughs lively hahahaha to be expected from the breast loving sekiryuutei oh looks like something outrageous appeared while we were following ophis sensei and old man also looked at great red how nostalgic great red huh have you also fought him tannin oldman shook his head to the
sides to senseis question no he didnt even pay attention to me so even old man couldnt become his opponent then that giant dragon how powerful is it its been a while azazel vali speaks to sensei did you defeat cruzerey asmodeus yeah but sirzechs was the one who took care of him if their leaders are taken down then their henchman will run awa y looks like shalba beelzebub was taken care of by ise in juggernat drive and onii sama buchou asks sensei the barrier collapsed so he returned to the observation room sensei then says it to ophis ophis the guys from the old maou faction who were rampaging in each area either retreated or surrendered in reality the old maou faction which was controlled by the descendants is now basically finished yes that is also one of the conclusions ophis didnt show even a slight sign of bein g shocked so it doesnt hurt them even if a single faction was crushed hearing that sensei shrugs his shoulder among you guys the group with power apart from vali is the faction assembled by the humans who are either the descendants of heroes or sacr ed gear
possessors i think they were called hero faction right hero faction there are still factions remaining in the terrorists group ah if i remember their organisation consists of dangerous heretics from different places now ophis shall w e fight sensei points his spear of light at ophis is the battle going to resume and the fight will be between bosses but ophis turns around i will go home oh my looks like she has no desire to fight people on our side wont be satisfied with t hat and old man tannin shouts and tells her to stop while spreading his wings wait ophis but ophis just put on a creepy smile tannin the dragon kings are gathering once again this will turn interesting hyuu when i thought the air vibrated fo r a momentophis has now disappeared oh my she ran away sensei and old man tannin were making a sigh we will also retreat valis voice he was just about to enter the cut to another dimension created by the guy wearing a suit you guys are too fas t at escaping hyoudou issei do you want to defeat me i do but you are not the only
one i want to surpass i want to surpass kiba who is in the same group as me and i also want to surpass my pal saji there are so many things i want to surpas s me too there are those i want to defeat besides you this is weird looks like the current sekiryuutei and the current hakuryuukou have dreams and objectives more important than their destined fight maybe you and i are weird dragons but something l ike that might be good at times but one day i then pointed my fist towards vali yeah lets settle it it will be a trouble if buchou and akeno sans oppai were reduced to half like i thought you are truly amusing get stronger hyoudou issei see ya oppai dragon and also switch princess ku bikous smile he showed at the end pisses me off wait whats a switch princess ah buchous face turned very red why kiba yuuto kun xenovia san the man wearing a business suit calls kiba and xenovia i am the wielder of holy king sword and the descendant of arthur pendragon call me arthur one day lets have a battle of holy swords good
bye after that vali and his comrades disappeared into the crack to another dimension i did think i should have gone after them but he saved asia i dont know whether he did it out of boredom or not but i didnt feel like fighting him here but one day i will definitely there will be a time when we have to face against each other so i need to prepare for then i took asias hand and said it to her with a smile this time lets go home for real asia to our home yes i will go home to the house otou san and oka san are waiting at i was looking at the smiling asiaand then i lost consciou sness vali lucifer vali i received contact from the leaders that guy shalba is on the verge of death but survived i see bikou either way shalba rushed it he was talking about resisting till the end and our ancestors who were exiled by the current maou government rushed it too they destroyed themselves because they only acted with hatred those guys from the old maou faction said they want you to become their leader what will
you do tell them im satisfied with my current position i dont want to increase my duty as the descendant of the former maou any more than this aaaah looks like the old maou faction is basically done for looks like the other factions will start to rise up now cattleya cruzerey and shalba you guys h ad too much envy if you chose to live as the prideful descendant of the former maou then you should have lived with pride like one so what was the reason for saving that healing sister from sekiryuuteis group it didnt seem like you at all just boredom thats the only reason heroes shalba beelzebub was defeated hakuryuukou vali also said he wont stand at the top i see so that means the old maou faction of khaos brigade is done for well maybe it turned out like that because the dimension lost possessor from our group held back as if you ordered him to do that so what now is it about time that we the hero faction which consists of the descendants of heroes act cao cao now what shall we do i was having fun gathering those with talents just
like the original but in the near future we will have to act whether we like it or not the thing which resides in you wont allow you to stay like that that ultimate longinus true longinus huh the dire ction this spear is pointing to is it domination or new life hhmm when i opened my eyes i was in my room huh i defeated diodora i then met vali and then what happened it feels like i have been losing my consciousness a couple of times are you awake when i looked in the direction from where the voice came from a silver haired maid grayfia san was there wait the crimson haired boy milicas is with her hes looking at me iseniisama has finall y woken up okaa sama milicas sama i have asked you not to call me that in front of people boo yes when i got my upper body up grayfia san gave me a cup of water ah thank you while i am drinking it grayfia san is trying to start up a holog raphic device huh what is this the device starts up and the vision of a man appears in 3d
its sirzechs sama he is wearing quite a rough clothing is he out somewhere secretly hey ise kun looks like you are awake ah yes thank you very muc h about the incident earlier thanks to you and rias effort we were able to settle things with the old maou factions for now i was then told that i lost consciousness at the end and that i have slept for a couple of days after that apparently turning into that juggernaut drive put a lot of burden on my body i cant turn into that form right now but i was also told i shouldnt while you were sleeping azazel talked about a couple of things with ddraig when you thought that you lost asia argento san your rage increased to the utmost level which released the sealed power i see so i turned into that outrageous form due to my anger but that ddraig appeared while i was unconscious huh that form allows you to attain the power which surpasses go d and maou temporally but it also reduces the life of the possessor considerably its better you dont turn into that form anymore if you die lots of
people will be sad even my sister yes i understand i dont remember what that form was but i dont want to turn into that form again there will be no meaning to it if i were to die i turned into that form after i thought asia died and went berserk but if possible i dont want to have to turn into that form ever again i was also told that the oldmaou faction of khaos brigade has collapsed because they lost their core members and vali who is the descendant of a maou has no interest in their matters so he declined their offer to become their leader sirzechs sama said the old maou faction is basically finished the remnant devils either surrendered or hid themselves in the darkness because of the incident involving diodora the house of astaroth lost all their trust the crime of their next heir having aligned with khaos brigade was serious and so the current head of the house of astaroth was dismissed the house of astaroth lost the privilege for having a maou come from their family for a while the current beelzebub was asked to take responsibility for this incident but
it seemed like the current beelzebub was also receiving an assault from the khaos brigade during the incident as well also because the other three maou defended him the voices of those blaming the current beelzebub have settled down right now losing ajuka beelzebub who is the current beelzebub will be fatal for the devils he is a man talented in technological programmes he is also the one who created the basic theory of the rating games most of all you cant find someone of his calibre sirzechs sama says that loo ks like the lack of manpower in the devil business world is a serious issue maybe its because i am the sekiryuutei so sirzechs sama also told me about ouroboros ophis but i had doubts about her especially with her aim can i ask you one thing wha t is it ophis the boss of khaos brigades and their aim is to get rid of that giant dragon called great red so she can return to the dimensional gap correct then if we help her wont she leave the terrorist group but sirzechs sama shakes his he ad to the sides no unfortunately that will be very hard
right now it is thought that all the dimensional gaps located in every part of the world are balanced because great red resides in it if great red was to be killed by ophis or vali or if ophis w as to rule the dimensional gap we wont know what will happen to this world nothing would have happened if it was ophis in the past but the current ophis stayed in this world too long so she has changed a lot from the first time she appeared so it mean s a serious thing would happen if the balance of the world collapses then ophis and valis aim are very dangerous so thats why leaders of each faction are having a hard time about this ngggh if i was to defeat vali in the future i need to hope someon e defeats ophis instead i dont want to be the one fighting her as well my goal is to become a high class devil and to make a harem we need to reconsider about the rating games for young devils in the future as well it will be too dangerous if they ar e all being interfered with by
the terrorists then it will be cancelled we probably have to restart it but there is a match which we want to see no matter what the people who live in the underworld and those from other factions are saying strongly that they want to see this certain match definitely a game between who and who the match between rias and sairaorg so many people want to see that match huh a battle between buchou and the number one youth sairaorg san i desire to fight you with only pure power the thing he said to me i still have it burned in my ears i see so if we were to resume the game we will fight sairaorg san next huh at the same time the match between sitri vs archduke agares is also desired strongly if we were to have the match played then it will be the matches of power vs power and tactics vs tactics sirzechs sama seems like hes enjoying it he must be looking forward to those matches anyway until the match makeup is decided all the young devils ar e asked to be on standby terrorism did just occur after all there is
a possibility that the game itself would be cancelled due to the public opinion of the underworld looks like the rating game for the young devils is also put in a tight spot but abou t the oppai dragon it seems like it became super popular amongst the children in the underworld im coming up with a second song ufufu when i was a child i dreamed of becoming a musician im happy that one of my dreams is fulfilled ah sirzechs sama has eyes sparkling with lights so he composed that song with so much passion huh sirzechs sama then says it to me you are amazing mme yes the audience group with the least number for the rating game is no you can say that it is basically zero and that audience group is the children for the children watching rating games among adult devils it would be far from entertainment for them the truth is the only game which is popular among children are the ones with reincarnated devils li ke tannin dragons monsters youkai and the match with those without human form for the children it would be like monster films with lots of impact hahahaha
a monster huh certainly old man tannin has the appearance of a monster in the future i don t mind if it is just during the game if possible i would like children who will carry the future of the next generation to see your fights so you are asking me to become the hero of the bratsi mean the children during the game yes but i wont force you it is just my hope i dont understand anything complicated about the how the game is important in the underworld but for the children huh thats the oppai dragon chichiryuutei i then remembered about the children who became happy se eing me when i took an interview somehow there was a side of me feeling eager to do this i never had someone become so happy to just see me just aiming for a harem as your goal is a waste i remembered what old man tannin said to me at the underwor ld no old man i wont change my ultimate goal of making a harem after all i want to have my own harem full of beauties but showing my cool side to the brats wouldnt be a
bad thing either maybe young mums might come with them as well someones wi fe a young wife wonderful if i remember right the recent hero programme also targets the mums for their audience as well if i become famous then my own hero show might start the kids will come bringing their mums maybe i will have a fateful meeting with someone i felt like i found the door to gather the beauties of the underworld uoooooooooooooooooooooooooo i will capture many wives oldman i will aim to become a harem king after all of course i will even allow wives roger that sirzechs sama for the wives no i will try hard for the kids by the way i can hear cheers from behind you whats going on ah thats right today it is the kuou academys school festival i also came to see my little sister shine w wwwhat i check the calendar and the digital clock to confirm the date and time of today ah it really is the school festival todaaaaaay craaaaaaaaaaaap i slept in so i almost missed it grayfia send ise kun to the academy using the transport magic circle ri ght away yes

show for kids which is currently being broadcast and as you can guess from the titleim the main character but its not like im the one who is acting they use an actor who has the same build as me in addition to using cg to insert and alter my face apparently it became very popular as soon as it was broadcast in the underworld the tokusatsu hero chichiryuutei oppai dragon koneko chan who is sitting on my lap and is very well informed about the shows of the underworld says while swaying her tail i know that the show is very popular because they told me that last time as soon as it was broadcast it exceeded the viewing rates of 50 and became a monstrous show i was actually shocked not only about the fact that a show with me as the main character was being broadcast but it was also quite popular the story synopsis goes like this a young devil who made a pact with a legendary dragon ise gremory is a hero who pledges to fight evils which are a threat to devils he is a man who loves oppai and fights for them he
tu rns into the legendary oppai dragon to defeat those who do wicked deedsand so on im watching the show for the first time today and even though im happy im also feeling embarrassed the house of gremory has the copyright to it and from what ive heard they made quite a fortune from it something about selling merchandise and stuff the devils sure act fast a toy version of the boosted gear has been sent to me as well and its pretty impressive its so identical that it frightens me it eve n has a voice module equipped the boosted gear scale mail which appears in this show is identical to the real one and the skill used to recreate it is truly astounding kiba is eating popcorn while nodding w well even from my perspective their skill in resembling my boosted gear scale mail is amazing here i come you evil kaijin tou dragon kicccccccck the oppai dragon who is wearing the armour used his special technique superbly on the kaijin flashy special explosions were used as well after that the protagonist was in danger because of the power of a special weapon used by the enemy then
the heroine appeared oppai dragon i have come the one who appeared wasbuchou wearing a dress obviously she wasnt the real one but an actress who has the same build as buchou and her face altered oh switch princess with this i can win oppai dragon then touched switch princesss breast uoooo what is this outcome and switch princess is that the name for buchous character if i rememb er its the name that bikou made it has been used officially the protagonists body glowed in red after touching the breast and he regained his power there is an oppai dragon with a switch princess on the good side and when they are in a crisis h e turns into the invincible oppai dragon just by touching switch princesss breast azazel sensei said that with enthusiasm spank and buchou hits senseis head with a paper fan excuse me azazel sensei i heard everything from grayfia sama you know the one who sent the idea of s switch princess to the house of gremorys data team was you right thanks to that ii buchous face was really red and it seemed like she was suppressing her anger who cares i heard
that since you started getting the support of the children your popularity got higher right sensei said while rubbing his head if i remember correctly in the next release of the magazine aimed for the young people in the underworld they will change the name of one of its article s from princess riass special to lets turn into switch princess everyone i wont be able to walk on the streets of the underworld anymore buchou said that with a sigh even i am now scared to walk on the streets in the underworld if i get caught by the children they will likely point their fingers at me and say ah its the oppai dragon who cares now after all you and i are the chichiryuutei there was yet another one here who sighed in grief the legendary dragon ddraig sanit felt like he didnt care about anything right now im sorry ddraig but i think its fun you know yeah i seriously never get bored when im with you fufufu i will also be tagging along with you from now on after all kukuku aaah he sounded quit e depressed ill need to cheer him up later i
realised that we had introspectively swapped places seriously get better soon sekiryuutei but you know i feel proud that my childhood friend is getting famous like this said the perky irina who seems to enjoy oppai dragon a lot although she is an angel she has blended in with the other occult research club members well she is a club member after all if i remember correctly ise kun loved tokusatsu hero shows when he was a child i also tagged al ong with him and we acted as heroes she said while doing a transformation pose ah i remember that pose its the transformation pose of the hero i liked when i was a kid we certainly did irina was a tomboy back then and i remember she was quite nau ghty too but now she is a bishoujo3 you really cant predict a humans growth mou suddenly seducing me like that so you seduced rias san a nd the others like that truly a frightening hidden power i will fall i will fall down to a fallen angel oh irinas wings are switching on and off between white and black p perhaps this is the moment when an
angel becomes a fallen one i heard t hat when angels lose to their desire or accept the devils whispers something serious happens hmm so this is it huh seeing that sensei laughs heartily hahaha dont worry i welcome the fallen plus you are a direct subordinate of michael i will w elcome you to the vip seat nooooooo the boss of the fallen angels is encouraging me to fall michael sama please help meeeeeeeee irina started praying to the sky with teary eyes but it is my pride that ise san is famous yeah it will be good pu blic exposure for our group asia who was next to me and also xenovia seemed to be enjoying it well i do think that oppai dragon is a success im shocked and even though i feel embarrassed im definitely not feeling bad about it instead i fee l thankful for it if i become famous like this it will become a status for me in the future most of all it seems like i will be popular with the women in the underworld gufufu next time i walk in the underworld ill be surrounded by beauties and i might be
able to take several of them to a hotel like that my dream sure is expanding ooommph i can feel something soft on my baccccck i remember this feeling when i turned around akeno sans face appeared behind my shoulder akeno san then put her face on my shoulder and whispered into my ear with a stimulating voice seducing irina chan is okay but id be troubled if you dont keep your promise with me my cheek is rubbing against her cheeks it makes me excited the silky and elastic skin of a keno sans is the best asia became unpleasant buchou has her eyes twitching koneko chan who is on my lap is pinching my thigh silently ah it hurts koneko chan it hurts promise when i asked akeno san said with a smile the promise to go on a date with me remember that you said it to me during the battle against diodora astaroth ah i certainly did say that so you remember now that i think about it it certainly did happen i said it to akeno san on koneko chans advice so that even c ounts as asking out on a date huh of course
are you telling me that was a lie you look so cute when putting on a sad expression with teary eyes this is cheating akeno san it wwasnt a lie i dont have a reason to decline it and a date with akeno san seems good i just answered like that and akeno san hugged me more tightly and said with a very happy voice im so happy then our date will be on our next day off ufufu my first date with ise kun a date with akeno san huh it seems good but judging from the way the other girls are glaring at me and akeno san something might happen life1 peace is the best part 1 in kuoh academy i was eating my bento with matsuda motohama and asia during recess if i remember correctly its almost time for the school trip and we still need to decide on our group motohama says while eating fried eggs oh yeah the school trip is coming up and we the second years are going to kyoto it totally slipped my mind all thanks to various circumst ances ive been through lately it is also this time around we change
into our winter uniforms though the essence of summer is still present hmm do we make a group of 3 or 4 people i ask matsuda nods in response to my question oh yeah apparently t he place where we will sleep in is for 3 or 4 people we have to make a group with the three of us as we are hated by the others after all dont say that baldy i know that very well the three of us are hated by the girls for being the perverted high sc hool boys this school has a higher ratio of girls than boys which is why they have strict opinions but after the life and death summer holiday opinions about me changed quite a lot but still i do not get along with girls very well leaving aside asia xenovia irina and kiryuu thats the reason we have our lunch together like this perverted trio do you want to pair with our group during the trip its paradise because it consists of four bishoujo you know a bespectacled girl asks us with a wink dont say paradise with such a lecherous face yeah leaving you aside they are
the bishoujo trio matsuda says while nodding and his head gets hit by kiryuu shut up well lets ignore this guy hyoudou its asia you know isesan will you p air with us asia chan asks with a smile mou if she asks me like that i will be troubled of course i definitely will yes hug me and asia forgot about our lunch and hugged yyou guys sure have gotten closer after the sports festival you guys are talking twenty four seven while sending the glares of love kiryuu says while adjusting her glasses fufufu asia and i share one soul in one body we are always together right i then had asia feed me a vienna sausage while saying aaah yes i will always be with ise san yeah it feels like the distance between me and asia shortened after the sports festival before i thought of our relationship as that of a brother and sister and tried to protect her as a brother but after the kiss ive started to think of asia as a woman rather than a little sister i see her like that a little more often now furthermore ive started to like her
more after retrieving asia from diodora ive come to realise how important she is to me i have to stay with her forever thats what i think she isnt a lover nor a little sister she is my family i think i will always be with asia until our death though i dont know after how many hundreds or thousands of years it would be ill take care of her fo r the rest of my life oh and i will add one more thing after that incident i have her give me a kiss on my cheek every morning well thats how it is so we will pair up with you guys i cant leave asia to other guys since she is pure and cant decl ine other peoples requests and that way xenovia chi4 and irina san will feel better as well right xenovia stops eating the especially large bento and nods at kiryuus idea yeah i also want to be with ise it will be more fun with ise kun irina who is eating bread also agreed shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit why is ise the only one getting popular like this man god is so cruel i also want to
be hugged by a bishoujo matsuda whines well yeah god is dead after all and rather than being popular im just in the environment which seems that way well it seems like im popular from different perspectives so i wont say anything wait am i pop ular if it is just limited to asia but the love between me and asia is different from the naughty harem ones so its complicated hmm lately it seems like there are so many flags for ise if i can actually see those kind of things i would break the m with a hammer motohama says it like a curse while fixing the position of his glasses your eyes are scary just like that lets move as a group with these seven people kiyomizu dera5 and kinkaku ji6 and ginkaku ji7 are waiting for us kiryuu declared it while having her glasses glow anyway the group members for the trip are decided the guys consist of me matsuda and motohama three of us the girls consist of asi a xenovia irina and kiryuu four of them looks like we will go around the town of kyoto with these members if i remember there is
a temple called tenryuu ji8 i have one of the two heavenly dragons ddraig residing in me so it might be good to go there so the school trip is coming up huh hmm maybe i should go shopping with asia and the others to buy the necessary products part 2 after school in the club room it was usually around this time that wed head back to our homes but today we were talking about the trip while drinking green tea our adviser azazel sensei didnt come to the club room today because he had to return to the underworld to discuss something as expected of the leader of the fallen angels he was often tied up with various things even so he still shows up at school so school life must be fun for him if i remember its about time for the second years schoo l trip buchou said while drinking green tea elegantly where did buchou and akeno san go last year akeno san answered my question we also went to kyoto and i explored kinkaku ji ginkaku ji and other locations with buchou buchou nodded and contin ued yes but there are only a limited
number of places you can visit within three days and four nights you should therefore keep in mind the places youll be visiting make a plan beforehand and act accordingly if you dont include enough time for eati ng and sight seeing youll regret it and as youll mainly travel from one place to another by bus or train lots of time will be wasted while travelling too buchou wanted to go everywhere but unfortunately we didnt keep track of time we spent while tr avelling and thus we werent able to go to nijou jou which we were planning to see last she was literally stomping her feet at the railway station when akeno san said that with a small laugh buchous face turned red geez you promised me that you wou ldnt say that remember i was in high spirits and for a japan lover like me visiting kyoto was bliss therefore i had my eyes taken away by the town and souvenir shops more than necessary buchou started talking about her memories she must have enjoye d kyoto a lot hadnt you been to kyoto before the school trip you could have used the transport magic circle
buchou said no no with her fingers in response to my proposal you dont understand ise how wonderful it is to visit kyoto for the first ti me on a school trip and i would definitely not do something as tasteless as visiting through a magic circle it was the very kyoto that i longed for i wanted to walk around with my own feet and feel the breeze with my own skin ah buchous eyes had a s parkle in them buchou becomes all dreamy when it has something to do with japan she did say she wanted to have a lifestyle which involved going between japan and the underworld even after becoming the head of the house of gremory oh yeah azazel sensei said he will also come with us to the school field trip he apparently wants to enjoy kyoto too after finishing her tea buchou changes the topic the trip is important but we also need to discuss what we need to do for the school festival ah the sc hool festival is also coming up at our school there isnt much of a delay between the sports festival school trip and school festival so they
occur consecutively when i think about it that way second years like us are certainly busy yes the schoo l festival happens after the school trip there are so many events in the second trimester buchou received a sheet from akeno san and placed it on the table it looked like we had to write our idea for the occult research clubs school festival presentati on and submit it to the school council thats why we need to discuss about the school festival now and prepare for it if it is decided before hand the third year and first year members can prepare for it while all of you are away there are so many mem bers this year so it will be a big help its just like buchou said the school trip is important but we also need to focus on the school festival as well school festival im looking forward to it asia seems like she is looking forward to it she lik es these kinds of events yeah i enjoy high school events too the sports festival was also great even though her expression hasnt changed xenovias eyes are sparkling she also made a big rampage
at the sports festival and claimed first place in everything after the sports festival each sports club tried hard to have her in their club it will also be my first time being involved in club activities so im looking forward to it i sure did transfer in at a good time this is also the guidance of michael sama irina says while making a pose to pray to the heaven the church trio seems like they are really looking forward to the school festival it might also have to do with the fact that they didnt have any chance for these sort of things due to the customs of their religion last year was the haunted house right i wasnt part of the club then but i heard it looked realistic and was a hot topic i didnt enter the haunted house but one of my classmates did and said that it looked real a pparently the ghosts that came out seemed real yes we did use real ghosts after all so it should have been scary buchou says this as if it were nothing rreal ghosts when i asked buchou responds normally with a smile yes i requested
the yo ukai which dont cause harm to humans to have the role of scaring people those youkai were also troubled because they didnt have a job so it was good for both sides thanks to that it was a great success buchou and akeno san started laughing like o neesamas we were scolded by the student council afterwards sona kaichou who was the vice president at that time yelled at us saying using the real thing is more than just ignoring the rules akeno san i also think you guys ignored the rules then will it be the haunted house again this year or should we do a circus show including a vampire in abox gasper made a weird face and started hitting my head senpai is a meanie you always use me as a joke playing with your kouhai is the senpais privilege im going to pick on gasper like mad until i graduate he is a valuable junior after all i will look after him properly buchou then started thinking about my suggestion maybe we should do something new when buchou was about to say somet hing our phones rang at the same time everyone knows what
that means so we looked at each other buchou took a breath and said with a serious voice lets go part 3 we the gremory group and irina made our way into the abandoned factory within the t own the sun had already set and the sky was getting dark there were several presences within the dark factory mixed with hostility and killing intent gremory group huh you guys come fast the one who appeared from the darkness was a man wearing a black coat from the darkness around that man black abnormal humanoids appeared there werent just a dozen but hundreds of them within the factory buchou took a step forward and asked with a cold tone khaos brigade i presume you are from the hero faction hello my name is rias gremory im a high class devil who was asked to look after this town by the three great power alliance hearing buchous greetings the man smirked yes i do know you sister of maou our aim is to purify you devils and to save this town he was looking at us like we were garbage yes that guy was a member of the group called hero faction
of khaos brigade who have been making small scale assaults in our town more like there are many incidents where people from t he hero faction are assaulting important places for each of the factions lately we have been taking care of them but our opponents had been humans in most cases twis humans appeared next to the man one was wearing sunglasses and the other was wearing a chinese native costume all three of them were foreigners you could say the weird abnormal black things were their combatants it seemed like the hero factions was using that as their weapons even if they were combatants they were too strong to be take n down by low class devilsit required the power of a mid class devil or higher and luckily in terms of power we were between mid class devils to high class devils flash my gauntlet glowed red the countdown had already finished so i went into balance b reak right away i wore the armour and step in front as the vanguard at the same time i took ascalon out and gave it to xenovia xenovia caught it and made a stance the two main vanguards consisted
of me in balance breaker and kiba standing at the very f ront a bit further away from us was xenovia her role was to support us and at the same time attack the enemy as the vanguard the middleguards were irina koneko chan and gasper they would support the vanguards and guard the rearguards and also do thi ngs like middle management supports it was the role of koneko chan and irina to defeat the enemies we forgot to take down the rearguards were buchou akeno san and asia buchou was the leader and did supporting attacks akeno san also supported us by att acking from the rear with her demonic powers asias role was to send the healing aura to the vanguard if we were to take damage this wasnt the formation of the gremory group but the occult research club when irina is added 3 33 i would fall back to the middleguard when im not in balance breaker and had the role to support it then would become 2 43 it was a different formation to that in a rating game the game forces you to move your comrades accordingly depending on the battlefield when the
ene my saw our formation the man wearing the black coat creates what seems like white flame from his hands kiba who was next to me narrowed his eyes another sacred gear possessor i see so this guy was also the members sent by the hero faction wer e basically all sacred gear possessors so they come at us by using the power which was bestowed to them from the sacred gear programme that god left behind this is a problem lately we have been fighting sacred gear possessors buchou also made a si gh but her eyes were filled with determination the moment the man waving the flame approaches us gooo i lit the fire on my booster on my back and made a dash right away from the start at the same time i reflected the fire doooooon they avoided it immediately but i was able to get rid of the abnormal combatants the combatants disappeared into the air when defeated shit i wont be able to move as i want inside the building because of my power output i could break the buildings in this town and that will gather attention and it will become a problem
but for dodging my attack they were quite trained but they werent enemies that we couldnt defeat we had the upper hand here by a big margin then one of the main enemies shouted be careful with the sekiryuuteis power we will get killed even from a single attack but he wont be able to move freely within the factory so they knew i could defeat most sacred gear possessors by hitting them once and also i gathered the demonic powers to my hand and shot it to the front while holding back as much power as i can don small scale dragon shot if my opponent was human then this would be have been enough since the fight against saji i practiced shooting a shot for small scale battles and t his becomes very useful in battles which take place in this town with this attack i took down members of hero factions numerous times it will be a lethal attack if hit zoon dragon shot disappeared the moment when it was about to hit the enemy it seemed like the shadow within the factory stretched and devoured my attack no maybe it was actually like that the ability
to control shadow the one who had done it was the man wearing glasses so its that mans sacred gear swift kiba went dashed fo rward at godspeed the holy demonic sword swung down at the man wearing glasses but the shadow from before devours kibas sword by moving fast then spit from kibas shadow the blade of the holy demonic sword came out kiba twitched his body and dod ged it he then stepped back the ability to release things it devoured from a shadow to another shadow as it wishes its not a direct attack type its a defensive type which changes the flow of an attack its a troublesome type of sacred gear kiba said while narrowing his eyes i got it now when the attacks get devoured by that shadow it comes out from a different shadow t then the dragon shot i shot before is boon along with the air vibrating i felt my aura from the shadow within the building when i looked a red demonic power shot is coming this way its target is asia xenovia who was slaying many creepy combatants sensed asias danger as well hell no i created another shot
of demonic power quickly and made it collide with the one heading towards asia to have them cancel each other out blow the two shots collided and a bomb blast is created within the factory i wont let you lay a finger on asia xenovia immediately acted as asias shield and started guarding her thanks x enovia but when it becomes about asia her response is insanely fast but protecting asia together is something we have decided its also because she barely has any combat ability but she is the key of the team and a valuable healer we cant let her get taken down in a team battle in the event that she faces danger its decided that the one who can respond to her danger would defend her this time it was xenovia puuuuuu inside the blast i saw something glowing in blue light when i lookedthe one w earing a native costume is holding onto a bow which looks like it is made from light and he was about to shoot light this is bad for us devils power of light is very poisonous and its an attack from a sacred gear with many mysteries we dont
even know what kind of abilities that bow has even if im wrapped with the power of sekiryuutei myself it will be dangerous for my comrades who arent wearing any protection the arrow made from light was released and it changed its direction in mid air so it has the ability to change its direction after being released sparkle sparkle several light attacks also came from the direction behind me if its a light attribute attack then leave it to me when i turned around irina made lights within her ha nd irina who is a reincarnated angel can use attributes of light she cancelled the attack of the enemy by using the spear of light freeze freeze wind cut the sound of something getting frozen and also the sound of the wind akeno san released spears of ice towards the light user without any pause but the shadow from before stretched and devoured the spears the ice then comes out from buchous shadow but buchou dodged it as if it was nothing you are so splendid buchou then the shadow appears ar ound the light user and started to create a wall then many arrows of light come out
from the shadow wall also the fire attacks of the flame user come out from the wall as well haa i the vanguard responded and hit away all of the attacks so they can even attack from within the shadow huh from our eyes the shadows are so thick and we cant see the light user gasper kun did you get the data of it kiba asks without taking his eyes off the enemies gasper who is a rearguard and who had been using a device for the whole time answers kiba yyesssssss i i got it the flame sacred gear is called flame shake and the defence counter type sacred gear night reflection lastly the light attack sacred gear is staring blue gasper has bee n finding out the sacred gears of the enemies by using a device created by azazel sensei the sacred gear scanner machine created by azazel sensei has been very useful lately its very effective in a fight against sacred gear possessors until now we got all the information of the sacred gears gasper once you finish drink my blood yyes i had gasper carry a small bottle with my blood in it thats so
he can activate his sacred gear to stop time anytime he wants to normally in a battle inside the town we make gasper turn a section of his body into a bat and make it fly around the whole battle area thats so we can find if there are enemies hidden koneko chan also uses senjutsu to search for the ki in the areas the two first years have the jo b to search around the area gaspers eyes are indeed powerful but in the battle against sacred gears it cant be used that effectively it seems like they know about gaspers ability so when gasper shows his glowing eyes and tries to face them a co mbatant reacts and becomes the shield for the sacred gear possessors and keeps them from being stopped they know about my powers and also about asias healing ability the reason why there is a light user with them is because they probably predicted th at it would be us the devils who would come to fight them the stronger we get the more likely we would become their target and the methods to take us down would be researched thoroughly probably something like
that i think kiba smiles sarcast ically target methods and to research then i remembered what sairaorg san said no matter how much power you have you will lose if you get trapped they will aim for the slightest opening with full power a slight opening even though we are ove rwhelmingly stronger we dont know what will happen when we show them a slight opening first of all that light attack is troublesome we are devils after all apart from me my comrades will be in trouble if they get hit by it head on it seems like kiba was thinking about the same thing as me so he was looking at the light user who is being protected by the shadow defence type sacred gear then the combatants appear in front of the sacred gear possessors looks like there are still plenty of grunts left how will we be able to get rid of that shadow defeating the possessor must be the best option but the shadow will most likely stretch and defend him and transferring my power to others needs to be thought out thoroughly in these circumstances everyone in our group is already strong so they
will turn into a monster of destruction if i transfer my powers thats why we cant do that inside the town we are invincible if we were allowed to go all out there is no use for me to think about the hard things i am the pawn who is also a vanguard after all i will just follow buchous orders buchou then gave her orders i will now give the orders to the vanguard team of ise yuuto and xenovia ise will take on the flame user yuuto you aim for the shadow user and xenovia will eliminate the grunts to make a path for the two of them middleguard and rearguard will support the vanguard with all of their powers we will eliminate all of the grunts roger everyone responded and moved out al l at once xenovia moved forward and started annihilating the grunts to be expected from a power type her power sure is different to others after the grunts perished kiba and i saw our targets kiba closed his distance with god speed and started slashi ng at the wall protecting the light user gulp the blade of his holy demonic swords were devoured after
this the holy demonic sword should come flying from somewhere spit it then came out from my shadow when i was heading for the flame user ise dod ge that and shoot the dragon shot to the shadow buchous order i dont know whether i can but roger that i dodge the blade of holy demonic sword ha ive seen kibas strike many times and received that with my own body during our training while dodgi ng it i shot out a red aura to the shadow don don oh my demonic power got sucked in i see so when it lets the attack out of the shadow that shadow will still be connected yuuto the shadows are connected so the dragon shot would come back at you cut the dragon shot in half inside the shadow and make it explode before it appears roger that following buchous order kiba wielded his holy demonic sword within the shadow dooooooooooooooooooon guwaa along with the sound of explosion there was a scream when i looked the shadow user was blown away i tested to see what will happen if the attack explodes inside the shadow but it seems like he couldnt take
care of it and it returned the explosion back to him even though he can change the direction of the attack it seems he cant change the impact of the attack buchou was putting on a smile of victory what foresight to be expected from our king while i was admiring her an arrow of light was flying at me its not blue its a green coloured arrow i got shocked at the sudden attack i somehow dodged it but another one came from the direction where i dont sense any enemies from everyone was also shocked at the sudden attack buchou then looked at the shadow within the fact ory looks like there is one more enemy using the shadow as intermediary the enemy attacked from outside which is the safe zone even if we took down the shadow user looks like the ability will still remain for a short while what theres more hidden enemies there are two light users then so the enemy can snipe us through the shadows which we cant see through that shadow sure is convenient ah but the shadows perished looks like the ability died off because the possessor was defeated gasper then
says it while looking at the device aamazing the data came out just from the attack now that was the staring green i will take care of that one then koneko follow me you can search the enemies location with the ki right yes x enovia senpai xenovia leaves the factory taking the cat eared koneko chan with her oh i also have to do my job gooooo i go forward while igniting my booster on the back damn sekiryuutei burn the flame user creates a powerful fire attack with bot h his hands aiming at me goooooooo the fire comes at me but weak its rather cold instead of hot raisers flames were hot even with the armour comparing it with old man tannins fire would be comparing it with a match stick if you want to burn me then bring a phoenix or a dragon don my fist cut through the enemys fire and then went deeply into his stomach a direct hit the same time the flame user went down kiba also defeated the light user who is a bit away from me we defeated all of the sacred gear possessors thats what we thought ngggggggggggggggh the
shadow user who was defeated got up and screamed then a black thing started covering his body the shadow spread even more and it started to cover the whole factory chills what are these chills im feeling i felt a weird power from the shadows how do i explain it i felt like a sudden change from him or it seems like he reached to something new flash then a light appeared below the shadow users foot and a magic circle was formed its a magic circle i have never seen before it looks like a transport magic circle but its not that of a devil it doesnt have the devils symbol at all fallen angel types but i still havent seen that before i have seen the magic circle sensei uses quite often so im familiar with the fallen angel type ones as well then the shadow user gets enveloped by the light after the flash the shadow user disappeared phew looks like its finished i took a breath after the battle and rem oved my armour good job ise san i dont have any wounds but i still got healed by asia asias aura is warm and that
alone feels like it healed me the combatants all perished the remaining ones vanished as soon as the shadow user disappeared go to sleep go to sleep gasper moved his fingers in a circle and made the sacred gear possessors lose consciousness its a vampires power gya kun sure has a cute pose buchou and akeno san created a magic circle so that they can send the two men capture d to the underworld all thats left is for xenovia and koneko chan to come back we defeated him we beat him up quite a bit but we didnt kill him xenovia returns while carrying a man on her shoulder koneko chan is behind her oh so you girls defeated him as to be expected from xenovia and koneko chan we also made that man lose consciousness its a shame that we let one of them get away now the transmission to the underworld is done well we probably wont get any information this time as well we have been sending sacred gear possessors to the underworld using the magic circle but apparently their memories while being in the hero faction have been erased we send them just in case
we can have them checked but i think there is a high probab ility that we wont get any new information it seems like they put a certain kind of programme on the sacred gear possessors memory when they send them to the crucial locations of each faction and if captured deletes their memories i heard that it is near impossible to retrieve the deleted memories its good that we can send them alive its the basic rule to kill terrorists without any exceptions oh yeah after the incident with diodora there was a change in my sacred gear especially to my balan cebreaker it took 120 seconds for activation but now i can get into balance breaker within 30 seconds also the duration where i can stay in balance breaker mode also extended a lot now i can wear my armour for 2 hours per day on good days ddraig sai d i would be able to go up to 3 hours the limit of one transformation per day is also gone if its within the range of my transformation duration i would be able to transform as many time as i want the two things which were a
major weakness of mine hav e been fixed quite a lot thats a major improvement im seriously improving i heard that this was due to the phenomenon of the so called juggernaut drive but this is still nothing i still havent caught up to vali yet but battling without breakin g as much things as possible is something really harsh for our team which is the super attack type kiba makes a bitter smile at my comment it cant be helped we have powerful abilities so if we dont fight while suppressing our powers then this town will collapse oh yeah there are people within their homes so thinking like that we cant destroy buildings even if it is an unused building and we destroy it people might realise about the incident if we think of this as a rule for the rating g ame then it would become a good experience we did suffer once with this its just like buchou said if we are going to do rating games in the future then there would be games with different rules if we adapt to these types of battles then it will be come useful for the actual game
in reality i think the experience in the match against sitri has become useful i can use the power of the sekiryuutei to a good degree but it certainly has become troublesome kiba says it while making a sigh what do you mean kiba i mean there are those who use special techniques among the sacred gear possessors who are sent to us if we say it in a way of devils then it means those who specialise in techniques and support types started showing up the ones sent first were all either power or wizard types have they started to grasp hold of our battle styles if you mention it the battles against the ones that have been sent by the hero faction have certainly increased in time their attacks were simple at fi rst then they started sending the ones with abilities that i cant understand this time the example is the shadow sacred gear sensei also said it that there are many unknown things about sacred gears buchou agrees with koneko chans comment yes thats why they devoured the power of sekiryuutei and holy demonic sword using the ability from just before they must have realised that
if blocking the attack is impossible then you can just do it with a different method uumm there is something i feel suspicious about can i give my opinion irina asks yes please irina starts saying her opinion with buchous request i think the actions of the hero faction are weird if they came to research about us or to defeat us weird xenovia asks and irina nods because if they really are planning to defeat us then i think they would have made battle tactics after 2 or 3 battles then they would attack us seriously in the fourth battle right but even in the 4th or 5th time they attacked u s nothing changed i did think they are just being very cautious but how should i put it it seems like their bosses are doing some kind of experiment experiment do you mean about us irina tilts her head at akeno sans question more like it feels like they are experimenting on the sacred gear possessors its just my gut feeling so i cant express it properly they are sending their forces apart from this town which belongs to the other factions so maybe they are just
sending their force s to the places where the ones with strong abilities are at everyone became quiet at irinas opinion even i started to think hard about irinas opinion i see so you can see it from that way huh i thought they were just sending their forces to each f action because they have them down as their targets so there must be a reason why they make the sacred gear possessors clash with us a sudden change everyone put on a serious face when koneko chan said that wait that is w wait dont tell me then the reason why hero faction send those guys to us is so they can reach balance breaker but ise kun the response that shadow user showed before disappearing into the magic circle dont you think it resembles it i couldnt disagree with kibas opinion that weird atmosphere that shadow user had it certainly seemed like he was trying to obtain something different so you are telling me it was balance breaker but can they reach balance breaker just by fighting us buchou says it while sharpening her eyes sekiryuutei the one who controls holy lightning holy demonic sword holy sword
durandal and ascalon the time stopping vampire nekomata senjutsu user and also an exceptional healer ise from the enemies viewpoints i think they see us as irregulars and as very powerful opponents more than winning or not to humans fighting us is something not normal so we are basically rare monsters with high exp to them huh ah but shes right i had a start for my power up by traini ng with old man tannin and i reached this high by fighting the legendary youkai sun wukong and a nekomata who uses senjutsu though i needed buchous oppai in the end the last stage of reaching balance breaker is different for each person but you can say that their methods are too forced and messy irina continues after kiba it feels like even if dozens or hundreds of their allies are killed it would be okay as long as one of them reaches balance breaker we have so many opinions about them now so i think they know that we are getting a grasp of their true aim we couldnt conclude our opinions so its decided that we will leave it for now we activated the magic circle and
then returned to the base when we took a breath after returning to the c lub room akeno san started humming and singing while we were preparing to go home she looks really happy ara akeno you seem to be in a good mood did you find something which will satisfy your s personality akeno san then answers buchous question with a big smile no thats not it ufufu its tomorrow i cant help myself from smiling the date tomorrow ise kun is my boyfriend yes tomorrow is the day off and is the day for our date the atmosphere changed immediately and it was scary that a ll of the girls were directing their killing intent at me part 4 we returned home after the battle how is it koneko chan who came into my room asked me she was in cat ear mode and was being embraced by me yeah it feels good koneko chan was u sing her whole body andher senjutsu on me lately i get my fatigue taken away by koneko chan who uses her senjutsu on me i get my external wounds healed by asia but i cant get my stamina healed with it
koneko chan controls the flow of the ki to rep lenish my stamina so i dont have any fatigue the next day apparently by controlling the flow of the ki properly the natural healing ability increases and the circulation of blood and things which are good for the body happen koneko chan is trying har d to improve that right now im having koneko chan use the ki on me and it feels good and warm im sure koneko chan is wearing a thin white cloth apparently it was given to her by akeno san because it purifies ones body and will be easier to use k i but this white cloth is so thin so i can feel the body of the woman directly koneko chan is small but she has a soft body so again i realise that she is a girl no no i shouldnt think like that about my junior from her soft body a warm feelin g gets sent to my body and spreads to my whole body it feels as if i am taking a bath at the ideal temperature and it feels so good at the same time even the inside of my
body is getting warm at the same time im removing the fatigue you have the l ife energy which was consumed by juggernaut drive can be healed bit by bit if i use the healing type senjutsu on you koneko chan says that to me while smiling maybe the reason why her face is a bit red is because she is being embraced by me who is a m an like koneko chan explained the feeling it feels warm inside because the life energy which was taken away is being healed bit by bit yeah it seems like the years in my life has been taken away quite a lot by this thing called juggernaut drive i h eard that i would be in danger at this rate at this rate you wont live longer than 100 years after the sports festival i was told that by sensei when i was unconscious sensei talked to ddraig regarding my body even if it was incomplete due to the effect of juggernaut drive my lifespan was shortened drastically and i was finally told that i wont live more than 100 years in the battle from earlier my life as a devil has
shortened very much a hundred years would be plenty for humans but it is v ery short for devils buchou heard that andshe was crying afterwards i couldnt let asia hear it if she finds that out after we promised to stay together forever i could see her fall into despair after i was told that i would die if i go into that fo rm whether incomplete or perfect my face remained pale for a while i was shocked what was more shocking was that i would have to part ways with my comrades after 100 years and i was very saddened by that fact well it might be weird for a brat in his teens to talk about whether he was going to live for more than 100 years or not but when i had 10000 years more to live and was suddenly told that i wont live more than 100 years the shock i received was huge i have only been a devil for about half a year and that means i used up 99 of my life span you know the shock i felt cant be expressed in words if it trimmed my life span by
a bit then i would be fine but this time i wasnt if i only have 100 years to live then i wont be able to fulfill m y dream of getting a promotion and becoming a harem king using the dividing gear was also forbidden apparently i will also die if i use it in this state as well it seems like even absorbing the opposite power will trim down my lifespan so i wont be a ble to do that anymore using the power of the sekiryuutei wont be a problem but by using the power which surpasses the limit will also start to shorten my life span it seems like vali uses the enormous demonic powers within him in place of his life and somehow manages that but for someone like me who has barely any demonic power would be since i dont have anything to use besides my life i will get closer to my death when i use the power which surpasses the limit of a heavenly dragon now using t he power which surpasses the limit due to rage would mean death for me but sensei also continued like this there is a way
to return the lifespan lost bit by bit and that would be the healing method by senjutsu losing my lifespan is one of the conseq uences for using juggernaut drive and if the core of life energy is broken or hasnt been broken then by using senjutsu on my body it can gradually return back to normal there will be many people saddened if ise senpai was to die i would also ha te it if senpai dies thats why i am doing this to retrieve the life energy which has been lost bit by bit i will spend all my life trying to heal it so please dont turn into that form again koneko chan says it with teary eyes as if she is be gging me i got a heartbeat if you ask me like that then i wont be able to say no koneko chan yeah i got it i wont make everyone worry about me anymore but i dont remember how i turned into that form so im not confident in it even so i will mak e sure i wont use juggernaut drive again yes please do koneko chan then hugs me tightly it feels
like she is trying to say please dont use that form again i never thought that koneko chan who is a powerful and strong tongued girl would h ug me like this when i first saw herbut im so happy having a close relationship with koneko chan is fun and i dont want to die before becoming a harem king more like i dont want to die before having sex with buchou i also want to have sex with ak enosan and i also want to work hard making babies with xenovia i even started thinking that it might be alright to have a relationship like that with asia so i dont want to die before fulfilling those dreams when i was thinking about such greedy thin gs koneko chan put on a very red face senpai there is actually a much more faster way hmm how do you do that its bobouchuujutsu hmm its a jutsu9 i never heard before bouchuujutsu what is that a woman who specialises in using the ki has to share her ki to the man and it heals the life core greatly hmm so there was a convenient jutsu like that maybe i wi
ll ask you to do that next time when i said that koneko chans face became even more red and she panicked she then says it with a determined voice u understood b but it is my first time so huh her response is weird maybe i should ask her for more details about it it seemed like something is going to happen because of my misunderstanding hey i will ask you just in case but how do you actually perform that bouchuujutsu koneko chan answers my question with embarrass ment the man and the womanhave to become one its a jutsu where the woman has to send their ki directly to the mans body heyheyheyheyheyheyhey that is that sex mugaa i was about to say that loudly but koneko chan covers my mouth yyour voice is too loud senpai i nod my head while having my mouth covered and i had her remove her hand from my mouth after taking a breathe i said it with a small voice then that means koneko chan and i would have to i cant do that this is outrageous i never thought that bouchuujutsu was tohave sex are you dissatisfied with me
koneko chan says it with sad eyes is it me or does she look more sexy than usual nno thats not what i meant koneko chan is my junior and its still its still too early but i didnt say it i knew that she would feel unhappy if i said that im really grateful but wouldnt that lead to making babies ah but even if we ar e devils it should be impossible between a former human and a former youkai no the female nekomata normally mate with the male of different race mainly it often happens with human males the topic changed to the issue about nekomata but i think this is good its better if we change the topic koneko chan cares deeply about her comrades and it scares me because it feels like she will give her virginity to me she needs to fall in love with someone seriously and do that with the one she loves arent there any male nekomata my question to her yeah i need to change the topic from sex to the population of the youkai the number of them are low but there are but female nekomata mate with males
from different races due to the old teachi ngs so they have a tradition like that huh even if she is a youkai i wonder if they have different ways to keep their kinds my kind is the rarest so its certain that i need to leave offspring i have reincarnated to a devil but i do want a ba by i see it would be normal for koneko chan to want to have a baby when that time comes i want her to make babies with the one she loves hearing koneko chans thought i was nodding my head koneko chan then says it while acting hesitant she se ems shy but she has determined eyes my b body and breasts are small but i still can have s sex properly i can still make b babies and if senpai really does come into danger then i would have to perform bouchuujutsu by force i am already pre pared for it nosebleed i started to get a strong nosebleed the erotic voice stimulated my brain immediately no you cant do that koneko chan kkoneko chan y you cant you cant turn into an erotic girl but if i live
in this house it seems like i must know about those kind of things lately thats what i started to think holy shit buchou and akeno san have finally even influenced koneko chaaaaaaaaaaan i put my hands on koneko chans shoulders so i can talk to her seriously please fo rgive me though as my nose is still bleeding if a girl says that to me no matter even if it is koneko chan i cant help but fantasize about it listen well koneko chan i have also said this to asia as well you shouldnt compete with buchou and akeno san it is very bad if you start learning from the scene between me and the two great onee sama koneko chan has to always stay as koneko chan onii san is very strict about those things i understood that buchou and akeno sans erotic attacks towards me not only give me a huge impact but also to the other members that isnt good those erotic attacks are overwhelming because they are being done by the two onee sama with erotic bodies but if pure girls like asia and koneko chan were to do that then i then i
would have my instinct blown away but asia senpai is also trying hard as well koneko chan seems a bit disappointed looks like one more push would be enough wait i have a date with akeno san tomorrow and what am i doing koneko chan you shouldnt copy buchou and akeno san okay they are just bad influences she shouldnt copy who again i wonder what this is about t this voice when i turned around my onee sama was standing there with a smile while emitting a dangerous aura bubuchou bouchuujutsu the mating with other races and i wonder what this bad influence is about yyou heard all of it im going to get killeeeeeeeed even asia was standing there behind her when on earth did both of them return to my room during this time they should be talking with the others in someone elses room until koneko chan finishes her treatment on me sob so you will make babies with k koneko chan i am always left out asia has teary eyes and sh e is totally misunderstanding this situation perhaps these girls heard the talk between me and koneko chan before entering the room and have
a total misunderstanding because they only heard bits of it koneko you are done with ises treatment right koneko chan also got scared at buchous smile and she just nods her head silently because of buchous intensity she left the room after saying g good night quickly nooooooooooooo dont leave me here koneko chaaaaaaaaan i see now ise lets go ins ide the bed since its already late but i wont let you go to sleep until you tell us what you were talking about with koneko right asia yes rias oneesama you arent allowed to sleep until you tell everything ise san both of them have some stran ge intensity in their words and they then drag me into the bed like this my interrogation continued till late at night but thanks to koneko chan my fatigue disappeared by the next morning part 5 next day day off i was standing at the convenience s tore near the station where we are supposed to meet up at it certainly makes you nervous when it is a date my heart is beating so fast my clothes are set properly even if we see each other everyday i need to dress
properly i look around the town loo ks like its in the autumn season but the heat from the summer is still present im wearing long sleeved clothes but maybe half sleeved would have been okay when it was about to become 10 oclock the time we promised to meet at a girl my age wearing a one piece with a cute frill on it stops in front of my eyes wait aakeno san im sorry did i make you wait nno i blinked my eyes and my heart was racing akeno san with her hair down her clothes are those cute ones worn by girls her age it is my first time seeing akeno san wearing boots i actually thought she would wear sophisticated clothes more mature women would wear thats what i imagined so this is how she dresses up when she goes out with buchou today akeno san is wearing c ute clothes worn by high school girls she looks the same age as me no she may even look younger than me she looks even more beautiful than usual no akeno san is always beautiful but today she looks exceptionally beautiful no rather than looking b
eautiful she looks cute while my eyes were taken by akeno sans cuteness i i feel shy if you look at me like that do i look weird today she asks me but i shook my head to the side you look super cute you look amazing akeno san seems embarr assed but also happy at my direct opinion she is usually the ara ara onee sama but today she is like a maiden this is cheating today ise kun will be my boyfriend for the whole day can i call you ise looking at me with those eyes and acting shy is really cheating akeno san pplease do even though my heart was racing i could only answer her like that and akeno san put on a big smile after hearing that yay thank you ise her expression of joy was simply the best oh crap a single express ion from her is like a weapon then i felt someones killing glare while i was feeling overjoyed when i looked around hau i saw a crimson colour when i looked carefully a crimson haired person who is wearing a hat and sunglasses is looking this w ay from behind
the telephone pole ah and also the blonde person who is wearing glasses with teary eyes and a small built person who has cat ears growing out from the mask worn by wrestlers and the suspicious guy wearing a paper bag on his head and ki ba who is dressed like he usually does waves his hands apologetically to us yeah its buchou and the club members did they decide to come and follow us while disguising themselves are they perhaps trying to secretly follow me and akeno san while were on our date ara ara for checking on whether we are having an affair they sure have too many people to check up on us akeno san realised it as well and made a small laugh she then approaches me as if she wants to show our closeness to them ah akeno sans hair smells so nice its so hard to resist crack i heard a dull sound behind me when i turned around timidly buchou who is filled with rage made a crack on the telephone pole s scary i will act as if i didnt see that sshall we go then yes like this akeno san and
i headed towards the town three hours have passed during that time akeno san was acting like girls her age when we went inside the brand clothes shop she would ask me things like hey ise do i look good in this and or do i look better in this one just like an ordinary girl her speaking manners are just like normal cheerful girls her usual ara ara and ufufu completely disappeared when we bought a crepe from the booth she said this is deliciou s right ise we were holding hands while walking in the town and the way she gripped onto my hand tells me that she is relying on me my heart was pounding in my chest the whole time what i learned today is this person is insanely cute p perhaps th is is the side of her which she will only show to her boyfriend she is normally the japanese beauty with an elegant and noble presence and thats the akeno san who is popular at school with her elegant speaking manner and attitude she shows all of u s the way onee sama acts but right now both her speaking manner and attitude
is that of a normal shy playful girl any guy would fall for akeno san if they see how she is acting now no the usual akeno is plenty no a very wonderful woman who can fasc inate any guy but but the gap she has now and her usual self can give a one hit ko on any guy because of her cuteness i see so if she has a boyfriend then she would act like this during the date she doesnt have a boyfriend now and im just acting a s the substitute for now but akeno san will show this side of her to the future boyfriend huh the moment i realised it the more i started to become jealous of her future boyfriend shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit im really jealous of the guy who would make aken osan his i started to get pissed so i decided to have so much fun with her that it will make her future boyfriend jealous of me i took akeno sans hand and declared it to her akeno san lets go to the aquarium and game centre we need to enjoy ourse lves today to the extreme akeno san was shocked first
but she replies with the ultimate smile yeah my brain went down with that single blow like i thought akeno san is super cute today there are so many weird looking deep sea fish arent there akeno san said with enthusiasm after exiting the aquarium akeno san and i went to the aquarium after having some fun at the game centre the aquarium in the town is small but it has a good atmosphere since the beginning of the date till now i had been holding hands with akeno san every time we saw a funny looking fish both of us pointed it out and laughed maybe from the perspective of others around uswe might look like lovers that would be the best a love date with akeno san it seriously is fun it will definitely remain as one of the best events of my life and there is a bunch led by the crimson haired person who was following us they gave off intense pressure i think im going to die after this date akeno san confirmed their presence aft er the crimson haired group came out of the aquarium she put on an adorable mischievous face and we
started running after she took my hand oh did something happen she turns around and says it to me lets shake off rias and the others what but i didnt argue and started running as well ah buchou and the others also started running after they found out we are running away from them while being pulled by akeno san we turned right then left inside the town trying to lose buchou and the others after a few minutes of running we hid ourselves after entering a small road after seeing buchou and the rest go past us from the shadows akeno san and i came out to the main road ufufu looks like we lost them akeno san stuck her tongue out and she seems like she enjoyed it hehehe im definitely going to get killed afterwards im sure i would get over killed well who cares im okay with it as long as akeno san is enjoying it but because we ran without thinking we didnt know where this place is how much of a distance did we run for then when i looked around i saw signs which said rest for yen or night for yen tthere
are just love hotels around us we came into a wrong place if buchou realis ed we ran into a place like this crap im seriously in deep shit if we dont get out of here quickly i would get into serious trouble aakeno san we definitely have to leave here or they will definitely misunderstand it happened when i was trying to leave here quickly akeno san was holding onto my sleeve a akeno san when i turned around akeno san who had a very red face says it timidly im okay with it huh okay w what do you mean i was in bewilderment but akeno san says it with a determined face if ise wants to go inside then i dont mind im okay with it from my noseblood flooded down ssseriousllllllllllllllllllly eh are you serious for real its okay its really okay are you okay wi th going inside the love hotel with me you dont mean just to rest right it means we would do that right akeno sandidnt have her usual erotic face and she was showing an innocent maidens expression ooooo akeno san your expression is so pur e so i i can
you actually do it hyoudou issei your partner is akeno san it might be the best chance there is while buchou doesnt have her eyes on uswe willwe will have our first time uooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooo buchou i believed that my first sex experience would be with buchou but now its akeno san i just received the best offer from onee sama it feels like i wont be a man if i dont take up the offer it seems like akeno san is determined with it so i think i wont be a man if i stopped here can there be anymore happiness if akeno san would be the one i will have sex with for the first time should i do it or not calm down me i need to thank maou sama for this blessing while i was about to make the ultimate decision of my life there was someone who interrupted it geez trying to make love to a woman at noon you sure know what to do sekiryuutei brat huh who is it the one who appeared was the geezer wearing rough clothes and a hat behind him there was a man with a good build and
the woman who looked diligent the woman was amazingly beautiful her silver hair was long and straight i can tell its silky just from looking at it geezer dont talk to me im deciding whether to do it or not right now wait huh ive seen this geezer before hohoho its been awhile it is i i came here from the far north the eye patched geezer said it with a lecherous smile i remembered his expression odin the geezer yes he is the chief god from the north i havent seen him ever since the incident with diodora hohoho wwhy are you here yeah why is he here in japan for sightseeing isnt that a bit of a rash plan while there is so much terrorism right now thats what i thought then the woman butted in odin sama i would be troubled if you wander in a p place like this you are a g god so please act proper oh she started yelling at the geezer ah is this per son perhaps the girl who was wearing armour and yelling at odin the geezer let me rossweisse you are a valkyrie who has to take care of
heroes so you need to learn about these kind of places i am a valkyrie who has no appeal after all you two also shouldnt come here during noon you two are high school students correct go home and study somehow the valkyrie called ross whatever hername issan started being angry at me and akeno san as well oh man looks like it isnt the mood to decide wh ether or not to go inside the love hotel anymore i regret it so much i started crying within myself when i looked akeno san was being approached by a man with a good build who seems to be the geezers escort y you are akeno san had her eyes wid e opened and she seems shocked someone familiar she knows him akeno what is the meaning of this the man seems pissed i can sense anger from his words what intensity its none of your business m more than that why are you here akeno san sharpened her eyes and started glaring at him the maiden side she had just before is completely gone for akeno san to glare at him this much who is he that doesnt matter anyway
get away from here its still too early for you he grabbed akeno sans arm and tried to take her away somewhere by force no let go of me akeno san is fighting back hey hey hey hey what are you doing to akeno san i grabbed the mans arm quickly and made him release akeno san i dont know whats going on but let go of akeno san cant you see she dislikes it more like who the heck are you i ask with the attitude to fight then i received an answer i never imagined im here as odin donos escort today i am one of the leaders of grigori barakiel i am also t he father of himejima akeno hes akeno sans father life2 the shitty geezer from the north has arrived part 1 hohoho i have come to visit odin the geezer is laughing loudly in the vip room located in the highest floor of the hyoudou residence apparently he had business in japan and came to this town just to pass by it seems like this place which is controlled by the three great power of angels fallen angels and devils is much safer than
other places a god visiting my house something amazi ng is happening grandpa who is in heaven right now everyone in the gremory group has gathered in my house azazel sensei has showed up as well the date with akeno san was cancelled like i thought after that we reunited with buchou and the others and we returned home bringing the geezer with us akeno san was disappointed but she was more troubled about meeting her father she became upset she doesnt even step forward and she has stopped smiling akeno sans father barakiel san is also here but ake nosan doesnt even look at him it seems the discord with her father is very deep barakiel san i heard what kind of person he is from sensei before he is a warrior type man who is also a very serious person i hear that he is so strong that he is on par with sensei in terms of attack power alone he is the strongest within the fallen angels he must be insanely strong then here is your tea buchou served odin the geezer some tea while smiling fufufu i got my cheek pinched really hard by buchou just
before she said she needs to discuss something with me very seriously afterwards i want to escape you dont have to worry about me but it seriously is huge that one is also huge this shitty geezer he looked at buchou and akeno sans breasts with lecherous eyes i wont forgive you if you touch them buchou and akeno sans breasts belongs to me mou odin sama you cant look at them with such a perverted gaze she is the sister of the maou lucifer sama the valkyrie person hit odin the geezers head with a fan the geezer started massaging his head with his eyes half opened is it alright to hit the head of the chief god from the north with a fan that valkyrie person sure is amazing geez you are so hard headed sirzechss sister is famous for being a beauty with a glamorous body so it cant be helped if i end up wanting to stare at her breasts oh this here is my escort valkyrie her name is my name is rossweisse i will be under your care during our stay in japan nice to meet you all with geezers introductionrossweisse san greeted us
she looks different because she isnt wearing the armour from before but she sure is beautiful is she the same age as me she looks like a cool beauty who seems to be good at working e ven if she is so young she is a virgin girl where the years she didnt have a boyfriend equals her age geezer gave us extra information with a lecherous face rossweisse san starts to panic a lot ttthat has nothing to do with this i didnt choos e to not to have a boyfriennnnd i didnt choose to still be a virginnnnn sob ah she fell on her knees and started smacking the floor somehow she reminds me of myself so i sympathise with her i didnt choose not to have a girlfriend either but ros sweisse san i thought you were a cool beauty but right now there is a huge gap between your appearance and personality well the business world of battle maidens is also having a hard time even if there are those with looks they are mostly those wh o are not outstanding lately the number of heroes and yuusha10 have decreased and the valkyrie squad has been
minimised because of the lack of funds so even this one was at the corner of the room before she became my escort geezer says that while nodding his head is that so hmm i really cant understand the world of the north sensei then says it while laughing at the conversation during the time geezer is staying in japan its decided that we will be his guard barakiel is a back up support member from the fallen angels side i also have been busy lately so i only have limited times i can stay here during then barakiel would be looki ng after all of you in my place i look forward to working with you all barakiel san gave a short introduction so we are going to be geezers guard huh geezer dont you think you came a bit early to visit here the date of your arrival should hav e been few days ahead the reason for your visit this time is so you can talk with the japanese gods right michael and sirzechs would be the middlemen and i would be sitting with you in the meetingright azazel sensei asked while drinking green tea thats about
it and in our country there is a bit of trouble actually there is a troublesome lad who is against my ways i thought i should move things faster before he does something thats why i want to discuss several things with the japanese gods until now we were basically unsociable to each other and we didnt have any connections geezer made a sigh while stroking his long white beard so the god from the north also has problems of his own huh well it would be natural for each faction to have a trouble or two when you mean trouble do you mean that you have the vanir after your head i beg you dont start ragnarok by yourselves geezer azazel sensei puts on a sarcastic smile hmm there are so many special words that i dont know what are they talking about i dont care about the vanir well there is no point discussing it by the way azazel boy it seems the khaos brigade are increasing the number of those who can use balance breaker scary isnt it but i heard that those are a r are phenomenon we all became stunned and looked at each other
so you would go into that discussion like we thought the reason why they had sacred gear possessors fight against each faction was to make them reach balance breaker yeah they are rare but there is some idiot who used the quickest yet the most scary and easiest way by force to make the rare phenomenon happen that is something that one who is knowledgeable about sacred gear would at least think of once but it is something no one could do because you would be criticised by each faction its definite that you would be heavily criticised whether you succeed or not what is that method sensei answers my question riass report is basically correct the plan in which you will eve ntually succeed when you do it a lot first you gather humans who possess a sacred gear by force its basically abduction then brainwash them next you send the sacred gear possessors to the place which has strong foes gatheredthe crucial places where superior beings reside in you continue that until you have someone who reaches balance breaker when they reach it you summon them by force through a magic circle so that shadow user reached balance
breaker after all sensei continues these are thi ngs no faction can do even if they thought about it if i who has an alliance with the angels and devils confronts them and do the same things at crucial locations then that will signal the start of a war so no one wished for that but they were able to do it because they are terrorists so if you were to treat sacred gear possessors like that you would be prosecuted by the other factions huh i think i trained to reach balance breaker in an inhuman way i had a monstrous dragon chasing after me d uring summer holiday your face is saying that you reached balance breaker in such a way ise of course i am sensei but you are a devil you are tougher than a human you know even so i almost died aaah well it doesnt matter since its y ou aah you try to settle the problem like that you are cruel sensei sob im the only one who gets treated like this im going to become a delinquent now either way its the khaos brigades way to abduct humans like that and brainwash
them t o make them reach balance breaker what kind of people do those kinds of thing sensei continues to answer my question the regular hero faction members are a gathering of the great legendary yuusha and heroes sama11 their physical bodies dont lose out even if theyre against angels or devils they also possess sacred gears and legendary weapons on top of that they have reached balance breaker and on top of that they have a pushy longinus which can even slay a god from the reports the hero faction has a strong will not to lay their hands on ophiss snakes so in terms of their power enhancement it still is unknown either way the centr al members are super strong huh more like can heroes and yuusha sama do such an inhuman thing what are they going to do by increasing those who can use balance breaker now thats the problem odin the geezer isnt even putting on a serious face and s ays that while drinking the green tea this geezer is quite the easy going old man maybe you can say he is an courageous person even in the battle from the other day he
went against the armies of mid class and high class devils by himself something one would expect from a god well this is something which is still being investigated so nothing will start even if we discuss it here geezer are there any places you want to go when sensei asked the geezer geezer moved his fingers with a lecherous fa ce i sure want to go to the oppai pub haha you sure have good taste chief god dono hell yeah lets go there right now then young girls from my organisation opened up a shop in this town for the vips recently i will invite you there then uhohoho to be expected from azazel boy you sure know your things prepare me a big breasted one right away im going to grope many of them follow my lead shitty geezer welcome to japan do you want to untie their kimono obi12 that is something you must do at least once when you come to japan i will show you the japanese style i cant wait for it i cant wait for it indeed both of them heated up and left the room immediately what perverted leaders can you
believe that everyone can you believe that person is a chief god and for such a lecherous governor and lecherous geezer to be the leaders of their groups aaah even buchou has her hand on her forehead while twitching her eye brows please take me as well thats what i wanted to say but i stopped myself from saying that it feels like buchou will get mad at me odin sama iim also going rossweisse san follows after t hem but you stay here it wont be a problem if azazel is with me you can stay put in this house no im going they had a conversation like that at the corridor and she followed them all of us in our group and barakiel san who are left behind ma de a sigh akeno i would like to talk to you i was at the kitchen located on the first floor i then heard a conversation when i was on my way back to the top floor when i was heading therei witness akeno san and barakiel san having some kind of argument dont casually call my name akeno sans voice is so sharp and cold that even i
have never heard her talk like this before she also doesnt have her smiley face but instead she has an unpleasant face what is the meaning of this that you are seeing the sekiryuutei is this trouble about me this is harsh the way he says that is odd i thought its rude to be eavesdropping but i would be anxious about this if i were to leave this is my life why do i have to have you comment about this i heard rumours that he is a shameless dragon that fights eating womans b breasts as his energy source and he has another name called chichiryuutei as well am i having barakiel san misunderstanding me using the breast as an energy source thats crazy am i having such weird rumours about me going around i held my head at the shocking comment uuu partner give me a break how much more do you have to torture me ddraig cries inside me shut up for a sec this is also a life and death p roblem for me as well i can stand being called oppai dragon but how can i walk around the underworld when there is a
rumour about me eating womans breasts uooooon uoooooon dont cry ddraig i also want to cry breasts are a side dish they aren t main dishes im worried about you im worried that you arereceiving embarrassing treatments ah i see that is the way a father who has a daughter behaves more than that barakiel san doesnt seem like a bad person what happened between him and akeno san dont talk about him like that ise kun islecherous but he is a kind and dependable man so you judge people by rumours and gossip you are the worst like i thought i cant do something likeforgiving you akeno san shes defending me i feel happy my eyes are getting soggy im saying this as a father barakiel san says up to there but akeno san talks over him dont act like a father then why didnt you come for me back then the one who left kaa sama13 to die without helping was you barakiel san became silent with those words then i who was hiding behind the shadow met akeno sans eyes isekun were you listening i was caught no it was my fault for eavesdropping i came out
while feeling awkward barakiel san became enraged when he saw me ngh shameless for a man to be eavesdropping like i thought the rumours about you targeting womans breasts are true i wont let you eat my daughters breasts damn chichiryuutei he has a big misunderstanding i want to cry for akeno sans father to have this kind of a misunderstanding but since he is senseis friend then misunderstandings l ike that should be cleared up maybe it wont that person seems like he will find this kind of misunderstanding funny and he might add stuff to itttttt what you say sekiryuutei eats young womans breasts azazel yeah thats right when he touches them the womens clothing are blown off and when he talks their breasts start to talk be careful barakiel maybe akenos breast might become the victim as if dont take it seriously barakiel heeeey can you hear me absurd he is like a mons ter who is a womans natural enemy which took real physical form a breast eating dragon aakenooooooo damn it sekiryuuteiiiiiiii i easily thought something like that must have happened it really seems something like that happened and its scar y since half of
that fits with the rumours i wont allow you to see e each other sparkle sparkle barakiel san has holy lightning running through his hand heeeey whats going on am i about to be wiped out due to a misunderstanding akeno san come s between me and barakiel san and she embraces me as if she is protecting me dont touch him please dont take away this person from me he is someone who is necessary for me thats why disappear from here you are not my father akeno sans scre am hearing that barakiel san stops his holy lightning and then says it while closing his eyes sorry after apologising with such few words he turned to leave his back looked a bit sad even for a person with such a good build akeno san akenosan hugs me tightly it seems like she has some feelings inside her she cant tell me i beg you dont say anything let me stay like this for a short while please ise her voice was trembling i dont know what happened between them but i gently hugged her back part 2 the next day we the gremory group participated in an event
in the underworld sponsored by the house of gremory yeah thanks it was a handshake and autograph event a huge row of people are in front of us and i give my autograph sheet to each kid while shaking their handsthe kids take my autograph which is written in my bad devil letters happily then they shake my hand with a big smile oppai dragon do your best they say something like that to me just se eing that makes me man cry underneath my armour craaaaap im super happy right now i will continue to be an oppai dragon for these kids switch princesss oppai switch kyaa buchou who was next to me doing autographs and handshakes made a small sc ream a naughty brat was poking buchous breast oyyyyyyyyy you cant touch buchous breaaaaaaast this oppai belongs to me you cant i warned the boy while crying you cant touch it buchous oppai is mine other people cant touch it mou ise do nt get jealous its just a little child who is doing it i will let you touch them afterwards so calm down buchou says that while making a sigh uuuu thats because buchou buchous oppai
has yes please let me touch it afterwards haaa so th at means switch princess is popular as well ah if i look carefully there are many woman lining up in front of kiba im so envious of him kiba has the role of the darkness knight fang who is the enemy from the television programme his appearance is t hat of a leader from the enemy forces wearing chivalrous armour i was originally hoping to become that my first dream disappeared due to the kids support but kiba has obtained the thing i originally wanted i dont care im oppai dragon no matter how you look at it and in front of koneko chan who is wearing a cute beastly costume many of her big friends14 are lining up koneko chan also h as the role as the hellcat chan who is on the good side along with oppai dragon koneko chan didnt hate this role and was giving them proper responses what a pro i saw the spirit of a professional coming from koneko chan we finished the autograph ses sion and returned to our dressing room with this the event has finished its mission accomplished man im
tired i deactivated my armour and returned to my base form then a staff member approached me isesama thank you for your hard work the on e who came bringing me a towel isthe ojou sama15 with the roll hair style raisers sister ravel phoenix oh ravel thanks i took the to wel and wiped my sweat when ravel heard that we would be participating in an event in the underworld she came to help us out tthis is also part of my training and i think giving dreams to the children of the underworld is a wonderful job that is wh y i am helping i its not like i am doing this for ise sama and the gremory group she says that but she did her task very seriously i dont quite understand her but i think she is a good girl when i first met her she had a very proud attitude and i only thought of her as an ojou sama i didnt like her because she looked down on me but now she can talk to me normally sometimes i feel a gaze of admiration from her maybe im just imagining it i started to
think that giving dreams to the kids is not a bad thing lately all the children have their heads full about you yeah they came to shake my hand very seriously so i felt that i need to protect their dreams seriously as well yeah i dont know how much i can do for them but im thinkin g of being an oppai dragon for them as much as possible ise its about time to return to the human world buchou comes into my dressing room ah thats right we have to guard odin the geezer after this that shitty geezer keeps on asking impossible things since his arrival he goes to an oppai pub and hits on girls walking in the streets and he does whatever he wants i want to hit his head with a fan just like rossweisse san does at least once yes we need to return quickly good work to you as well ravel thank you for today tthats all right this is all for my learning ravel cheeks turn red when she was thanked by buchou then see you next time yes please call me for the next event if you n need me
then i will definitely help you out after having a conversation like that with ravel i returned to the human world with buchou and the others man a handshaking session i definitely want to do that again part 3 the event in the underworld ended and after having been dragged around by odin the geezer for his tour in japan me kiba and gasper of the mens team were battle practising gooooooooo i am in balance breaker form and i have fire coming out of the thrusters on my back and i am chasing after kiba who is moving aroun d in a zigzag at god speed kiba who is a knight has faster legs than me but boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost i can go past him directly if i multiply my power and increase my dash the boosters on my back give the maximum output and i close my distance with kiba immediately giiiiiin kiba wields his holy demonic sword and i made my ascalon appear to block his attack gin giin giiiin both of us move in various directions while moving at a very high velocit y during that time he was wielding his sword while not showing even a slight
opening shit fighting him using a sword will be disadvantageous for me i started to get pushed back and kibas blade started to reach me the speed of the holy demonic swo rd is increasing i start to lose the sight of his blade with my eyes when kiba reaches his top speed he will definitely come against me at once so there is no option but to fight him with my fists while closing the distance to him even more gooo i made the booster on my back go on and went within his range a body blow from a short range unlike me kiba has nothing on his body in terms of defence i have an overwhelming advantage i also have higher attack power as well if it hits then my chance of winning will increase but gakin i heard the sound of metals colliding kiba made the pommel of his sword strike like a bowling ball and he smacked my helmet from the side maybe he foresaw my body blow so kiba used a counter on me possibly due to being hit on the head my consciousness and sight became warpy for a moment i had my
brain shaken so if he cant hurt me with a direct blow to the outside of my head he decided to aim for the inside instead kibas counter is very effective for clo serange fighters i have received it many times and xenovia also received it many times as well im always on alert but i cant predict how and where he will counter attack because it always changes but i never thought he would use his pommel like that i thought that by closing my distance with him to where he wouldnt be able to wield his sword it would stop him from responding to my attack i cant be hit like that again so i decided to leave my current position and step back but i had my foot frozen and i had myself connected with the ground its the holy demonic sword of ice kiba has a sword made from ice within his hand with this i got my legs sealed and i wont be able to escape sparkle sparkle and another sword in his othe r hand he has a holy demonic sword covered with electricity a holy sword of lightning so hes planning to use
that to electrify me inside my armour then i will also show it my secret technique ban a pair of red dragon wings appear from my back on both wings there is a small claw just like those of a pteranodon its a new thing added to me due to the influence of juggernaut drive i still cant fly properly but i can at least move them i moved my wings very precisely and had the claws on my w ings grasp hold of kibas hands yeah i caught both his hands your guard is down i try to hit a strong blow to his stomach since his stomach is defenceless even though his arms are sealed he made a blade appear from his right foot and he tried to k ick with it so you can create a sword even there when my blow and the holy demonic sword on kibas leg was about to collide a heavy sound was made ttimes up thats the end of the time its a s stop gasper was jumping around while carrying a la rge bell kiba and i stopped our attacks just before they hit there is a time restriction for
practice battle kiba and i draw ourselves back while making a bitter smile today it is a draw there are times when i cant keep up with ise kuns training loads after the practice kiba says that with a smile while gulping a sports drink after the practice battle each of us do our own training kiba is resting gasper is training by stopping a small sized robot flying in the air using his eyes the robot is for gaspers personal use a training item created by sensei i deactivated my armour and made a bitter smile at kibas words while doing a squat maybe i had an insane power released from me after going into juggernaut drive but i cant use that anymore because i will die but if asia was to no my comrades might be put in a dangerous situation even if i cant use juggernaut drive that doesnt mean im done for i will become stronger in another way if i dont have talent then i can make it up by working harder if i lack demonic powers then i can make up with my stamina i wont give up i heard that sairaorg san also
obtained his place as the heir in the same way if someone has accomplished that before me then i can work even harder fo r it yeah even if an idiot like myself had his life shortened due to juggernaut drive there is no point for me to stay there and wait to rot i also cant show the children myself in that situation either if buchou and sairaorg sans match was to happen the whole match will be broadcast throughout the underworld i dont want to show my pathetic side to the children but in terms of speed i cant beat you kiba when i said that kiba shook his head to the sides the instant dash you did when you used the booster on your back was the same speed as me only at direct speed even if i close my distance with you directly you dodge it the majority of the time it seems like i would have to move around in a zigzag like you but i still havent been able to use my booster properly yet right now i can only move forward with it you have to get used to it but in terms
of power you overwhelm me also having sekiryuutei as your opponent puts a lot of pressure on me and i get chills every time your p unch comes at me no matter how many lives i have it isnt enough well thank you for that then but it takes time for my attacks to hit him kiba also counters so i hesitate because i have to think how to attack him lately me kiba and gasper have bee n training in this sturdy battlefield created by azazel sensei and sirzechs sama its made in a certain basement in the gremory territory of the underworld me and kiba cant train to our hearts content due to our abilities if we get serious we will des troy landscapes or fill the area with swords we were having troubles because there were only a few places we can train at then we got a present from those two people apparently it is a present because of our achievement in the incident involving diodora we transferred from the magic circle located at my house and came here its made quite special so apparently it wont be sensed by terrorists it seems like high class
devils who participate in the rating game have similar places as well and we who a re youth devils received it as an exception it seems like the ones who have this exception within the youth devils are us and sairaorg sans team other members also use this place quite often this time we wanted to do this with just guys so we are the only ones here right now we are getting stronger right i ask kiba while doing a squat of course i know this is rude to say but you and i have surpassed buchou and akeno san we probably can overwhelm average high class devils now but we can t let our guard down yeah since my abilities and yours are known by many its easier to deal with us right kiba nods at my words yeah my ability and kibas ability was shown throughout the rating game which was broadcasted throughout the underwor ld since that happened other high class devils would make a counter plan or a proper strategy to defeat us my weaknesses are that i wont be able to stand up against powerful attacks without balance breaker and my power increase is
easily sensed by oth er people when it increases the aura around my body increases drastically at once if the opponent senses ah he increased his power there is a threat that they would avoid me or run away it will be bad if they make me consume my stamina randomly to chase the opponent who fled away destroying the battlefield would be okay but if a special rule is created like the time in the sitri match i wouldnt be able to do that easily kibas weaknesses are that his defence isnt that high since he has nothin g protecting his body and also his legs legs are part of kibas speciality but it is also his weakness he would be out if they aim for his legs nggg like i thought the rating game is really deep for example there is apparently a sacred gear which s lows down the opponents legs so i would also be in danger if i were to encounter such a foe it will be alright if i dont get hit by it but we wont know what will happen in the actual thing kiba says that while drinking the sports drink so
that is k ibas natural enemy huh i also have a natural enemy as well and that is a dragon slayer even i would have to be on alert if i was to encounter a dragon slayer you are right so it would be dangerous if you were to be hit even once there is also com patibility during a match so if someone with a dragon slayer were to show up then we will take them on though we would have to depend on ise kun for other opponents i still havent received a dragon slayers attack with my body but it must really hurt just like the damage from light wwwwill i be of any use gasper asks while raising his hand timidly in your case rather than fighting individually its more wise to fight while pairing with us isnt it when i said it while looking at kiba ki ba nods thats right gasper kuns power is adapted for supporting so its real potential will be unleashed only when pairing with someone from the group as long as we continue to live as devils it is necessary to get adapted to team battles so coveri ng each
others weak points would be an obvious thing to do well becoming strong by yourself is good but we wont know how effective that will be against strong teams yeah ise kun especially needs to be careful since you are trying to become a ki ng by leaving buchou in the future it would be game over if the king is to be taken down huh yeah i know that really well so i will get used to team battles as soon as i can though it might be good if i can fight like sairaorg san the king stepping forward and fighting but if a strategy was made to counter that we are also thinking of tactics to take on sairaorg san individually but if we were to fight like how he does then we would be out huh man this is hard the world of devil s that is i got it then when i become a king i will think carefully about my actions besides certain times like this we the mens team gather here daily to train and discuss about game strategy if i remain on saying i dont know then my future ahead will be
unstable so i study really hard about this with kiba and others thanks to that im able to discuss about these things pretty well looks like your knowledge about tactics has become sharper then a new voice is heard when i turned aroun d it was azazel sensei here i have some food its onigiri16 hand made by the girls we the guys were in joy and stuffed them into our th roat immediately yum this onigiri has a taste of asia it has a kind taste to it sensei sits next to us who are taking a break and then laughs looks like your body is turning into good shape ise i can tell that it is due to training a lot by the l ooks of it i wont be able to become the ultimate pawn if i dont get even stronger its something i promised buchou so i need to fulfill that before i become independent oh yeah i heard when the time comes for you to become independent from ri as you are taking asia and xenovia with you right he heard it from asia or from xenovia well that doesnt matter i guess well yeah
you did it well i dont know how to put it but i promised asia i will always be with her i want to stay with asia too i also think it might be fun to do the devils business with xenovia as well i dont want to separate from asia after all sensei then says it while roughly patting my head one thing ise if you are going to become a king in the futur e then there is one thing you must remember what is that sensei suddenly put on a serious face and says it its sacrifice during the game there will definitely be a time when you have to abandon your pieces how will you cope with it when th at time comes your value as a king will be tested then so you are saying i should abandon the option to save them sensei shook his head at my question you can save them if you can save them then you should do that in real battle it is a seri ous thing saving your comrades that is but it wont be like that during a game since there is a transportation when you retire
chances of you dying are slim that being the case you may have to abandon a critically injured comrade and move on to the next step you sure ask me for a difficult option i cant abandon my comrades if my comrades are in a pinch then i would go and save them immediately you have the greatest affections with your comrades in this group and that will turn into an o bstacle in future games kiba sensei then moves his gaze from me to kiba yes during the game in the worst case who would you choose between rias and ise i will choose buchou kiba answers sensei without any hesitation yeah thats the right answer even i would have hit him if he chose me instead im not the one who has to survive in the worst case during the game that would be the king buchou if the king was taken down then all is done for sensei continues after confirming that other members also need to hold that determination as well maybe its because you guys are the gremory group but your love towards your comrades is strong your affections towards your comrades are amongst the
top class within the devils as well that wil l be your weapons but also your weak points if other devils learn that these guys wont abandon their comrades then they will build their tactics aiming for that point continuing to lose the matches due to saving your comrades will lower your ratings what you guys need in the future games is the resolve to abandon your comrades who go down in front of your eyes sona sitri has shown you that during the game in the summer holiday im not telling you to abandon your comrades during the real battle bu t keep that in your heads during the games ise especially needs to understand that if you are planning to go independent the one who has to survive till the end in the game when you are the king is you and not your servant devils the resolve to sa crifice my future comrades huh yeah hes right i need to understand that even i who havent become a king yet am suffering this much just by thinking of it so i wont be able to completely understand whats going inside buchous heart buchou do you have the
resolve to abandon me and kiba can you do that if buchou can win the game then i will happily give up my body i also need to hold that resolve in the future its frightening the courage to make your comrades into sacrificial pieces i would want to somehow avoid that i will have to think about it until that time comes what will i have determined when i participate in the game as a king wait i have to promote before becoming oneeeeeee im talking big by saying that i will become independent but i dont know when that will happen vali said something like i will be able to become a high class devil within few years but i dont know if that will happen nggggggh going ahead towards my dream day by day im thinking of goin g forward step by step without any lack of working hard but before that i need to think about the game in front of me i kind of understood what i have to do in buchous game i took a breath and then said it to kiba and gasper kiba gasper it seems like we have to be resolved
kiba nods you mean the resolve to abandon our comrades who fall in front of us during the game right yeah we need to make buchou win the rating games gasper also responds to my thoughts while having rice around his mouth yyes thats exactly right thats why lets be defeated while smiling for buchou except we are to be taken down after giving it our all and lets be defeated while taking on the enemy head to head we would look uncool if we were to show our back to our enemy lets take them on face to face and fair and square and then be defeated yeah yes thats right if we were to be taken down we the mens team will go down looking cool while protecting buchou but more than that lets win we cant discard the feeling of wanting to win sensei was scratching his cheek next to us you are saying something cool but you know ise can you do something about yourself when you fight women i know that dress break and pailingual are effective bu t if you just concentrate on using that they will aim for that point more like the
weak point of it is easy to tell if a half naked woman appears what will you do my eyes will be all over them sensei lowered his shoulders at my answer this guy i s useless hes definitely going to lose eeven if you say that if an erotic woman was to appear in front of me i wouldnt be able to calm myself ah thats why it is easy for them to aim at that and lower my guard hmm so i should get used to erotic things impossible i wont be able to charge ahead while ignoring erotic things in front of me thats because we have to look if there is an oppai in front of us phew well who cares when i finished eating the onigiri i confirmed that kiba and gasper also finished eating and raised my spirit okay then kiba gasper lets do another round of sparring from the beginning then yeah i shouldnt think too much about it and train for now when i tried to spar with kiba once again sensei tells me to come to him by gesturing with his hand ise come here for a bit he had a
lecherous expression he thought about something again huh what is it sensei the thing is another prototype for the oppai dragon came to me again check it out when i app roached him sensei got something out of his pocket wwhat is this the thing sensei took out isa small figure it was decided that oppai dragon was to collaborate with a hamburger chain in the underworld its a toy which comes when you order th e kids meal this one is the toy of you this one here is the toy of rias aka switch princess it ccertainly looks like a deformed toy of me in a balance breaker this one here is the toy of crimson haired buchou haa it certainly is made delicately it looks cute there is also a gimmick to it you get a bonus when you collect both of them when you poke on switch princess with your figure sensei moves the hand of the toy of me and pushed the breast of the toy of buchou then iyaaan buchou s voice echoed what is this isnt this amazing like that it makes a sound sensei said it while putting his chest forward proudly
what is this i really want it uwaa this will definitely be a hit product i took the toys into my hand while my body was shaking amazing this is a sacred toy y you can actually make these sorts of things hahahaha right even sirzechs praised that it is a world shaking toy i love thinking about these kinds of things listen if you want to become a high class devil then you have to value your ideas sensei who was laughing proudly looks so bright amazing i did think this person was a genius but never thought that he was a genius of this calibre terrifying idea indeed to make a business by using a single idea of oppai no wonder sirzechs sama would be in joy the future of the underworld is going to be bright the governor of fallen angels azazel to be expected from the charismatic fallen angel i think deeply from my heart that i was glad he was nt my enemy listen ise oppai are filled with dreams so lets show them to the kids there are dreams which grow using oppai yyes a business using oppai is the best i was making
the toy cry out iyaaan iyaaan continuously and then sensei tells me with a serious face can i leave akeno in your care i opened my eyes wide at the sudden request sensei continues as if he is telling me something you probably know but akeno hates barakiel and the fallen angels since barakiel came this time she wont listen to me as well the only man who can talk to her properly is you if something happens please support her i can feel safe if it is you i dont mind but i dont quite understand her situation you know want to hear it thou gh if you hear it from me i would talk as if im supporting the fallen angels side since im the governor of the fallen angels at the same time if you hear it from akeno it will be full of hatred if you want to hear it then hear it from sirzechs or gra yfia those two will tell you from the proper perspective i see akeno san is part of the gremory group it certainly might be better to ask those two who know about the servants of the house of gremory
sensei continues on im sure you realised it after living with her but there is a part in akeno where she is emotionally weak usually she acts as the admiration of the school students one of the two great onee sama who is covered with elegance but when that is removed the one there would be a gi rl similar in her age the most obvious time was when you were defeated in the match against sitri the queen who has to be the most calm acted differently to that of the kings tactics i kind of know what he is saying akeno san is usually an elegant and confident onee sama who says things like ara ara and ufufu but at times she has a side when she acts as a maiden and when that side comes out she looks very fragile she is a dependable onee sama and i think that the true akeno san is one of tho se girls around there thats what i think so i dont know how accurate this is sensei puts his hand on my shoulder and said it with sad eyes there will be times when she shows those sides of
her to you so try to do something about it when that happen s what do you mean by something this will test your ability as a man ise its nothing much girls will feel safe when you embrace them and kiss them once or twice my ability as a man thats something im most lacking at if i was man enough i would have done a threesome with buchou and asia who sleep with me every night already am i gutless for not doing anything at the most important part i dont want to admit it even if im like this i will be aiming to become a harem king but i wil l definitely make that true i will definitely become good at handling girls also about the juggernaut drive then sensei started to talk to me about the juggernaut drive i wont use it i dont want to die after all well thats obvious but it has awakened once so im thinking of looking into the power of the sekiryuutei from a different perspective different perspective there is another way then how would i do that because of the influence of juggernaut drive it should be in
the state where the thoughts of the past boosted gear possessors are released i asked ddraig and found out that the negative feelings of them are trapped within the sacred gear it is basically like a curse and it seems like they are trying to use the power of darkness to control you and rampage so they can drain your life to the sacred gear tthat certainly is a terrifying story negative feelings a curse this sacred gear is more like a type of horror genre than i thought if i think about it i s till dont know that much about this sacred gear i just use its power basically there are still unknown factors about it they say that the families and people close to the past possessors have become unfortunate due to the curse thats why if you eli minate the cursethe negative feelings then instead of the juggernaut drive i made the logic that you might be able to attain a power that rivals juggernaut drive without trimming your life for that you have to go deep into the consciousness of th e sacred gear and release the thoughts of past sekiryuuteis from their negative feelings
sso i have to put to rest the fragments of the past possessors thoughts who are residing within the sacred gear and then create a new powerful and safe power whi ch isnt a juggernaut drive well thats basically it putting to rest the thoughts of the past sekiryuutei try to do that ddraig help him out with it yeah thats okay but the thoughts of the past sekiryuutei are so covered in deep darkness that even i wont be able to approach them the oppai dragon hyoudou issei kun will do something about that this is insane i still have to test whether i can do that at all but i wont be able to use the current juggernaut drive anymore not just me but it might make those around me unlucky so thats even more reason not to use it looks like i have to believe in senseis hypothesis and find the new power that way ise i believe in your chances each one of the past sekiryuutei was devoured by the power your talent must be the lowest in history but i believe you are the embodiment of possibility since you attained balance breaker with a womans
breast and reverted back from a berserk state with a womans breast oppai dragon thats certainly something you know that it has been a while since a dragon reached such a unique name right even if your physical body and demonic power is lower than vali and other legendary dragons you can still get used to the power of sekiryuutei and become even stronger in your own way from now show your actions with your efforts guts and unexpected ways yes looks like i have to believe in sensei believe in ddraig and believe in my chances i will become stronger in my own way on top of that rather t han being used by this sacred gear i want to achieve using it instead the man who understood about the boosted gear the most in the history i also think having such a title would be awesome after thinking that i resumed my training with kiba and gaspe r part 4 on a certain night after several days since odin the geezers arrival we sensei geezer and rossweisse san were inside the wagon of the eight legged warhorse called sleipnir and we are flying if i may add we
are moving in the sky during the night maybe its because the warhorse is big but the wagon is also big kiba xenovia irina and barakiel san are flying outside as a guard this is done so we can take on the terrorists immediately if they show up the japanese yamato nadeshiko sure is good geisha girls are the best this shitty geezer odin was laughing hohoho while putting on a satisfied expression damn it think of us your guards lately we have been dragged to various places in japan with this giant warhorse we went to the kyabakura17 located in the metropolitan area we went to the amusement park and also went to a few sushi restaurants we were sightseeing j apan as the geezer wanted to because we are under age and high school students there were places we couldnt enter so we had to be on standby near the entrances damn you you shitty old maaaaaan if he treated me to go into a kyabakura then i wouldn t have had this much hatred towards him when i looked all the group members had an exhausted expression beside me asia is leaning her head on my shoulder
and is sleeping akeno san on the other hand is it looks like her mind is elsewhere she was e mitting an aura from her body which said not to talk to her but taking care of the geezer sure is hard when i get mad he says such things like im deaf so i cant hear you or azazel san is the oppai not ready yet and avoids me so obviously he is indeed an outrageous old man but this old man is an important guest so we didnt complain to him that much and followed him quietly odin sama its almost time for the meeting with the gods of japan so please lose that mindset of being on vacation a t this rate you will be yelled at by other people when we return to our homeland the past few days rossweisse san responded calmly and followed odin the geezer but it seems like she is at her limit and is about to explode geez you are a woman who do esnt know how to lighten up how about you relax a little thats why you cant even get a single man this has nothing to do with
me not having a b bboyfriend im not s single because i want to be aaaah there she goes crying again people from the north sure are hard to handle i hope they leave soon thats what i started to think but kakun hiheeeeeeeeeen suddenly the wagon stopped and the impact of it stopping hits us everyone lost their balance at this unexpected event what hap pened dont tell me its a terrorist i dont know though when things like this happen its never anything good rossweisse san and sensei were on alert i heard the cry of the horse so it means something happened to that big horsie when i looked out from the window of the wagonkiba xenovia and irina were in battle positions while having barakiel san positioned at the centre ii still cant fly i can have my devil wings appear but i cant manage to fly even sensei laughed at me it sure is f unny that you attained balance breaker before flying i think the sequence of it is the other way around normally i can make dragon wings appear during my balance breaker state if ddraig can handle the flight control then somehow
ill be able to fly looks like i need more training i also need to practice flying as well even if i raised my power i still cant let the kids in the underworld down i opened the window of the wagon and looked ahead of buchou and everyone else at the same time i started my countdown for balance breaker i dont know what will happen so it would be good to be prepared just in case up ahead a young looking man is floating hes a good looking man who has a bit of an evil look in his eye the thing he is wearing resembles the robe the geezer wears when he is dressed up properly though the main colour of it is black rossweisse san realised who the man is and puts on a very shocked expression and azazel sensei made a sound with his tongue w what is it who is he when the man lifts his robe he made a smirk and talked very mightily nice to meet you everyone i am the evil god of northern europe loki eevilgod did he mean god if hes from northern europe then is he from the
same place as the geez er everyone apart from me has serious eyes it seems like they are very shocked its as if their faces are saying no it cant be sensei flaps his black wings and exits the wagon lokia norse god buchou says that next to me god seriously tthen that means that person is a god from the same place as odin the geezer what did he come here for somehow it feels like its nothing good if it isnt loki dono to meet you in a place like this do you have some business with us on this wagon is the chief god of northern europe odin dono you know what the consequence of your actions are no azazel sensei asks calmly the god called loki then spoke while crossing his arms nothing much our chief god left our organisation to get in touch wit h other factions and that is very painful to endure a declaration which sounds completely like a villain hearing that sensei changed his speaking manners you are quite arrogant to say that up front loki his voice is also mixed with anger even if he looks like that sensei likes peaceful
days so he seems to hate those who come and selfishly disrupts the peace hearing sensei loki laughs with enjoyment fuhahahaha if this isnt the governor dono of the fallen angels normally i wouldnt want to meet you or the devils but it cant be helped along with odin and the others you shall receive my punishment so its okay for you to get in touch with other factions thats contradictory its okay if it is to destroy other factions i dont a gree about having peace it is your religion that stepped foot on our soil and spread the bible after all theres no point saying that to me say that to michael or the deceased god from the bible sensei replies like that while scratching his head either way it is a problem for the chief god odin to negotiate with the gods of the far east then we wont be able to have the day of ragnarok what is it you wish to obtain by trading for the information regarding yggdrasil sensei points his fingers and then asks i will ask you one thing are your actions connected with the khaos brigade wait if i remember you
werent an evil god sama who would answer honestly loki replies back without caring i feel sickened that you would mix my opin ions with those foolish terrorists i came here of my own will and ophis has nothing to do with this hearing that answer sensei loosened the tension in his body so you are not from the khaos brigade but this is also a problem in its own way i un derstand geezer so this is the problem that the north faction carries huh when sensei looked towards the wagon the geezer just got out of the wagon with rossweisse san he activated a magic circle under his feet and he moves in the air along with th e magic circle hmm there are still a few hard headed people and thats the current situation we are facing there are fools like this one who come out like this geezer says that while stroking his white beard loki sama your actions exceed your auth ority doing something like pointing your fangs towards the chief god this is unforgivable you should make an argument at the official meeting rossweisse san changed from the business suit to armour immediately and
then said that to loki but the enem y didnt listen a mere battle maiden shouldnt get in my way im asking odin are you still planning to continue doing something which is outside our norse world geezer who was urged to answer replied back normally yup talking to sirzechs and azaze l is ten thousand times more interesting than talking to you i want to know about japanese shinto they also have an interest in our yggdrasil after we make peace im thinking of exchanging our cultures by sending out each of our messengers hearing th at loki smirks i have confirmed your plans such a foolish act lets have a display of powers here then chills i suddenly felt uneasy an overwhelming hostility starts to pierce through my skin the god loki was releasing his hostility towards u sno i can understand he is aiming his hostility at odin the geezer so i can take that as a declaration of battle right loki also smirks at senseis last warning take it as however you want it to be dogaaaaaaaaaaaaaan then a wave hits loki when i looked around to see what happenedit seemed like xenovia swung her durandal
there is a massive amount of aura rising from the holy sword victory goes to one who makes the first move xenovia says that calmly you act too fast xenovia thats such a head start it seems like it didnt work to be expected from a norse god when i looked back after xenovia said thatloki was standing there as if nothing happened are you for real xenovias attack couldnt do a thing holy sword huh it has impressive power but it isnt enough to take on a god yet its no different than a gentle breeze kiba creates a holy demonic sword in his hand and irina also creates a sword of light in her hand loki laughs seeing that fuhaha futile even if i lo ok like this im a god a mere attack from a devil and angel is nothing loki points his hand forward slowly my instincts understood that some unknown pressure is gathering at his hand allowing him to shoot that isbad welsh dragon balance breaker the countdown is over a red aura envelops around me and it shapes into armour ddraig i will leave the flying to you yeah leave it to me i
got out of the wagon the same time my balance breaker activated and i charge forward in super fast speed towards loki jet a sound echoes from the jewels and the booster on my back ignites gon i close the distance immediately and try to release my punch but it was dodged swiftly my punch just passed his nose and misses i then shout at the sa me time buchou i will be using promotion receiving buchous confirmation i promote to the queen right away i felt power flow inside me oh thats right i forgot that the sekiryuutei was also here you have quite some power on you but glowi ng particles of light gather at lokis hand i can tell just by looking at it he is compressing overwhelming power and he is trying to release that at me a direct hit from that would be bad its still too early for you to take on a god i shot my drag onshot with my maximum power towards the wave of power loki is about to shoot boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost dobaaaaaaaaaaaaan the two forces collide violently and blow up the explosive wind created by them comes at me and my
comrades shit he easily destroyed my full powered attack so this is the strike of a god huh red smoke dissipates from lokis hand it seems like my dragon shot worked a bit loki saw that and he makes a smile its not like i he ld back completely this is truly amusing it certainly makes me happy so i will have a laugh then fuhahahaha im not happy at all if that wasnt him being serious then he is an opponent who would be very hard to handle by myself taking on a god wit h the power of sekiryuutei might be hard buchou and akeno san spread their wings and came out of the wagon buchou is covered in crimson aura and shes in a battle mode crimson hair house of gremorywas it you must be the blood relative of current ma ou two leaders of the fallen angels one angel many devils and on top of that the sekiryuutei is with you odin for a mere guard this is a bit overboard dont you think a fool like yourself ended up coming here it turned out to be the right decisi on after all loki nods at
the geezers words and made an even stronger smirk very well then i will call it saying that he spreads his robe and says it loudly come out my adorable son lokis shouted after a moment of silence a rift is create d in space what is it did he call something nuuuuu the thing which appeared from the distorted space isan ash grey dog no a wolf a giant wolf which looks like it is 10 meters tall appears in front of us chills wh w what is this this u unreal pressure the moment the wolf glared at me my body was unable to move as if i was paralyzed next i felt a cold thing running through my body i felt more fear killing intent urges to run away and sense of my heart being grasped more than w hen i was confronting loki shit my hands are shaking when i looked around not only me but other members of our group have their bodies shaking as well buchou kiba and also xenovia even our members who are daring are frightened at the unseen pressure that the wolf is giving out wwhat is that wolf what on
earth is that the wolf doesnt show any sign of moving it was just piercing us with its eyes partner he is dangerous if you can you should avoid him even ddraig who is called the sekiryuutei18 is saying something like that so it means that wolf is such an opponent huh that wolf is definitely way stronger than loki this is bad you guys dont lay your fingers on that giant wolf ise keep your distance from it senseis expression is so nervous that ive never seen him like this the daring azazel sensei who didnt even back down when taking on the old maou is saying that sensei that wolf what on earth is that sensei answers my question as if he can barely slip a sound from his mouth fenrir everyone became shocked at senseis answer but also at the same time they seem to understand the reason for their trembles fenrir impossible in a place like this this is certainly bad kiba and buchou both understand about the enemy and they were on alert what is it though i do understand that it is incredibly dangerous ise that is one of th e worst and greatest
creatures it has the fangs which can definitely kill a god if you get bitten by it even that armour wont last that much so this giant wolf is that dangerous and it can definitely kill a god isnt that cheating i unders tand now no wonder ddraig told me to avoid it perhaps we wont be able to defeat it even if we were to go at him at once loki says it while patting fenrir thats right you should be careful this one is among the top class of the worst monsters that i have created after all this ones fangs are something which can kill any god i havent tried it but it should be effective against gods from other religions it can give mortal wounds whether you are a high class devil or a legendary dragon point lokis finger is directed at buchou i actually didnt want to use the fangs of my fenrir on those not from the norse well having this child learn the taste of the blood of those outside the norse world might be a good experience for him that b astard dont tell methat hes my bad premonition then became true
by lokis mouth the blood relative of maou tasting that blood will also become useful for fenrir kill her ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon under the abyss night the ashgrey wolf made a howl that howl was enough to make our whole bodies shiver and it sounds so beautiful that our hearts were attracted to its howl swift a single flow of wind the wolf in front of me disappeared from my sight that moment my body m oved before my brain did jet i wont let you i will never let you buchou the woman i fell for dont you dare dont touch heeeeeeeer bang i dashed in front of buchou before the wolf did and i hit the wolfs face who came at her with godspe ed uwaa i became shocked at my own decision thats because i didnt move my body with my head just now its just that the giant wolf was about to head towards buchou so my body told me that i must protect buchou when i realised it i had hit th e wolf ise buchou also seems shocked bubuchou are you okay are you hurt nno im okay thanks to you protecting me phew i became
relieved and sighed i dont know what actually happened but it seems like i was able to protect buchou that shitty wolf was trying to bite and then kill my buchou the wolf which i had hit looks at me with a fine face it didnt work hahaha this wolf is a tough one gough hhuh i had just vomited out a blood w what i then realised the weird change in my body and when i looked at the area around my stomachthere was a hole in the armour the moment i saw that i vomited out more blood from my mouth then intense pain comes to me ise isekun buchou and akeno san made a scream like cry my stomach is hot ouccccch w when was i wounded when i looked at the wolf the claws on its front left leg were covered in blood did he also pierce through my armour just before i hit him dazzle my body wavers while in air grab my body was a bout to collapse down but kiba supports my body isekun lets heal it immediately with asia sans power isesan please come here quickly asia who is our healer says
it while crying from the wagon shes creating a healing aura in her hands she mu st be trying to send the power of healing to me no i wont let you sekiryuutei even if it was just for a moment you were able to follow fenrirs movement this is truly terrifying i will get rid of you before you become a threat loki tries to give an order to fenrir again being attacked again will be bad i cant dodge it if i dodge then it will hit buchou i cant do that i will protect buchou im scared of dying but more than that i cant let rias gremory die lokkkkkkkki sensei and bara kielsan each released a spear of light and holy lightning at loki with maximum output even without using fenrir just two mere fallen angels wont be able to stand a chance against me a magic circle with an equation ive never seen before becomes his shield which expands throughout the sky sensei and barakiel sans attack was easily blocked norse magic if i remember their magic is more advanced than the magic of our religion just to be expected from the world that has
greater magic and sorcery than our world sensei says that with disgust the two fallen angel leaders attacked at the same time but it didnt work so this is a god huh then i will use the same magic biiiiiiiin rossweisse san activated many magic circles which had the same equation as lokis magic circle and released many attacks from them randomly it seems like its a full burst attack it has a shocking power output so rossweisse san is also quite a fighter she is odin the geezers bodyguard so it wouldnt be wei rd for her to have that much power amazing that person is she talented at things like magic and sorcery ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba baaaan lokis defence magic circles are activated around his whole body to defend him and it easily blocks rossweisse sans attack its even useless with the same magic now it is my turn loki tries to swing his hand to the side fenrirs murderous intents increased along with it its emotionless and cold eyes are directed at us koneko chan and xenovia step in front of the injured me and their master buchou to act as our
shield stop its useless thats a wolf that cracked open my armour both of you wont be able to endure it my comrades are about to be killed no i dont want that at this rate we will be anni hilated i dont want that to end like this while my head gets full with despair a single light passes through my sight it went past the wolf at the speed of light half dimension kubabababababan the space distorts while having the fenrir in the centre of it fenrir also has his movement sealed by the space distortion but soon it bites and tears apart the distortion made in the space with its fangs a white silver thing descends down between us and the wolf hyoudou issei are you okay vali the one that appeared in front of us is the hakuryuukou vali that attack i thought i had seen it somewhere and it turned out to be this guy after all but that attack halves anything within its range just how powerful is that fenrir who was direc tly hit by it and just had his movement sealed for a second oy oy was the oppai dragon wounded geez
he sure is a guy who i cant tell whether he is strong or weak the one who came from the side riding on a golden cloud is bikou why are these guy s here oh my so its the hakuryuukou huh loki smiles happily at valis appearance how do you do god of evil loki dono i am the hakuryuukou vali i came here to eliminate you hearing valis declaration of war loki makes an even more stronger smile i am satisfied after seeing the two heavenly dragons i will retreat for today loki brings the wolf back to him when loki turns his robe a big distortion is created within space and it envelops around loki and fenrir but on the day of me eting the gods of this country i will come here once again odin next time fenrir and i will definitely tear the chief gods throat when loki and the wolf fenrir disappeared my mind went off i have been losing blood a lot lately when i woke up i was being healed by asia a warm green light envelops me and it took away the pain in my stomach completely asia thank you i
thanked asia while looking in her eyes because i woke asia sheds a tear isesan im so glad i cant die whi le leaving asia right i hugged asia back who started hugging me senpai im glad you are safe so koneko chan also stayed with me since her hands are covered with ki she must have been strengthening the natural healing ability within me thank you koneko chan i pat koneko chan on her head nyaa senpai yeah im okay now and where are buchou and others only me asia and koneko chan are inside the wagon rias oneesama is talking outside with everyone also hakuryuukou san as we ll thats right vali appeared at the end of the battle against loki i lifted my body up slowly and left the wagon it had already descended to the ground and it was in the park near the kuou academy since its still night there is no presence of people i walked towards the location of buchou sensei geezer and everyone else i then heard valis voice to make odins meeting successful you will need to take down loki correct vali says it without hesitation after looking around at everyone
you wont be able to fend off loki and fenrir with just these members and also because of the hero factions attacks the underworld heaven and valhalla are in a ruckus so they wont be able to send more people to your aid no one can argue back agai nst his claim my eyes and valis eyes met vali makes a bitter smile and everyone looks at me after seeing where vali was looking ise are your wounds okay yes buchou im okay now more than that i looked at vali when i looked bikou and arthu r the holy king sword wielder were behind him and also kuroka as well it seemed like they were looking at our response are you telling me that you will defeat him when i asked with a low tone he shrugged his shoulder its unfortunate but even th e current me wont be able to take on loki and fenrir at the same time and thats your answer you were talking proudly just now hes useless since he said he cant defeat him by himself but vali looks directly at me its a different story if the two heavenly dragons were to join
forces everyone including me became shocked at valis suggestion the only ones who arent shocked are vali and his comrades of course we would be shocked i never thought that he of all people would say that we became so shocked that we couldnt speak and vali continues for this battle im saying i dont mind fighting alongside hyoudou issei life3 the j oint army part 1 next day everyone gathered at the spacious hall located at the basement of hyoudou residence we the gremory group irina azazel sensei barakiel san sitri group andlastly the vali team was present which turned it into a place with an awkward tension it feels weird to have vali and bikou present at my house buchou and oth ers were against them coming to my house but after hearing sensei and sirzechs samas opinion they agreed to it sirzechs sama why did you allow these guys to come to my house dont tell me it has something to do with them saving asia it cant be more like what are their reasons for cooperating with us what are they thinking he said he will eliminate loki but is that his true intention i dont
get it at all odin the geezer and rossweisse san are contacting their homeland from another room it also became a big problem for them since loki came to japan now then we have already started discussing about the countermeasures against loki the maou sirzechs sama is also aware about this case we are having this has also been passed to the heaven and the fallen angel side to make odin the geezers meeting successful it was decided for the three alliances to cooperate and protect him so they are telling us to take on loki with just us our opponent is a god but the biggest problem is the wolf he is carrying with him fenrir a real monster which has power surpassing that of its father what i heard was that it has a power on par with the two heavenly dragons before they were sealed and even sensei and old man tannin cant beat it one on one of cour se me and vali who cant pull out the full power of the two heavenly dragons are no match for him apparently by using juggernaut drive we will have a chance to defeat it but i will
die if i use it and vali will end up using his demonic powers and wont last long enough to fight loki if it goes wrong vali will also use his lifespan and die we might win if the remaining members fight putting their lives on the line but there will be sacrifices i was told that it would be certain for several people to d ie in it reinforcementsare something we cant hope for from every faction that is the terror where the hero faction are sending sacred gears users is still continuing and each faction is in chaos because of it each important area has the maximum al ert on and it is a situation where they cant send any of their man power to us if thats the case then we would have to find a way to win this battle while minimizing the casualties as much as possible since there is a countermeasure for it the strate gy meeting is still ongoing first of all vali what is your reason for cooperating with us sensei who is standing in front of the whiteboard asks vali a question which we all wanted to know yes we want
to know the reason why this guy is helping us its too creepy vali makes a creepy smirk and then speaks i just want to fight loki and fenrir bikou and the others have already agreed to it does this reason not satisfy you he is a battle loving maniac he must be crazy for wanting to battle that dangerous monster hearing that sensei twitches his eyebrows with suspicions yeah im not satisfied but its true that we want you as our manpower right now we are in a situation where each faction cant send their manpower to us because of the hero faction there might be a connection between your team and the hero faction but due to your personality there is no way for you to cooperate with the hero faction yeah we try not to get involved with each other as much as possible im still pl anning to fight loki and fenrir even if we arent able to get your cooperation though if you dont cooperate with us then we will still battle them while dragging all of you into it a threat huh if we cooperate they will defeat loki with us if we dont
cooperate they will attack us along with loki in order to defeat him huh it seemed like sirzechs was also thinking hard about this but he said he wont be able to turn down the offer of you who is the sole survivor of the descendants of old maou he sure is a nave maou but i also think that it would be better to have you cooperate with us rather than letting you roam free though there are more issues which we cant come to an agreement with each other buchou says that after hearing sens eis opinion it seems like she has some complaints but since the maou who is the king of devils said that buchou also wont be able to talk back sona kaichou also seems to agree to this though her expression tells me she is very dissatisfied it must be easier to have them under surveillance rather than letting them free but i dont know if this guy will actually listen to us or not if buchou agrees to this then i have to do the same well if these guys show any suspicious movement then i think i should be prepared to beat
them at least asia who is very honest doesnt have that much suspicion towards them because they saved her once other group members seem to have some disagreement to this but they came to agree to it sensei then stares at v ali though hes probably plotting something who knows though it wont be a problem if we make it so that we can cut down any suspicious movements i dont have any intentions of doing something like that but if you were to come at me i wont go down doing nothing vali just smirks at senseis words well lets put this about vali away for now lets move on to the countermeasure against loki im planning to ask a countermeasure about loki and fenrir from a certain someone you are going t o ask about loki and fenrir yeah there is this guy who knows very well about those guys so i will have him give information to us who is this person i said that while putting my hand up one of the five dragon kings sleeping dragon midgardsor mr a dragon king huh so what does that dragon king have to do with all of this
well thats an obvious choice but will midgardsormr respond to our call sensei answers valis question we will open the dragon gate with the two heavenly dragons the power of the dragon king fafnir vritra and tannin we will just summon midgardsormrs consciousness over there his actual body is sleeping in the depths of the ocean in northern europe hmm so there is a way like that so legendary dragons can do those kinds of things huh is it me or am ialso included the truth is i feel pushed back because everyone else are monsters saji asks that timidly he does have the sacred gear of vritra after all well i will have you come as one of the factors needed leave the majority of it to me and the two heavenly dragons hold on until i get in contact with tannin i will go and talk to shemhaza about the countermeasure for this you guys stay on stand by until i come back barakiel follow me roger that sensei and barakiel san leave the hall after saying that the occult research club members and the student council are left behind and also the members of the vali team
sekiryuutei bikou puts his hand up wwhat when i ask bikou says it with a naughty smile can i go to the indoor pool below this floor i didnt know how to answer back because he asked something which i didnt expect buchou takes a step forward and points her fingers at bikou hey this house belongs to me a nd the sekiryuutei hyoudou issei i wont allow you to do as you please it seems like this house became mine and buchous well her spoiled comments like this arent something new so i guess its alright but buchou sure has a harsh attitude towards bi kou well he is mainly an enemy so that cant be helped i guess now now let me use it switch princess smack buchou smacked bikous head very hard oooooooo it made a huge sound bikou then talks back at buchou with teary eyes ouuuuuch what wa s that for switch princess you because of you iam being called weird names in the underworld buchou also has teary eyes she is super pissed she is about blow up ah so you werent okay with that after all if i think about it the first
one t o call her that name is bikou and sensei used that name after hearing that who cares oppai dragon i also watch that show im honoured since the name i gave is being used bikou just laughs loudly while having fun he seems like he really is enjoyin g it deeply from his heart nggggggh what should i do with you buchou seems like she doesnt like bikous attitude and her whole body is trembling she is enveloped in a red aura and she has a dangerous atmosphere around her sso this is the last e xcalibur so amazing yes vali got information from his personal connections and when we compared it to the scroll passed in my family we were able to find it though the location of it is a secret when i looked at the place where the voice came from irina and arthur were discussing about the excalibur irinas personality is useful at times like this she opens up to others right away next to them kiba and xenovia seem to be listening to their discussions while being alert they must want to k now about the holy swords since both of them are
swordsmen then asia pulls my sleeve shes acting hesitant whats wrong asia uumm asia directed her gazeat vali i then realised what she wants to say you want to thank him asia nods her he ad silently at my word the other day vali rescued asia who was blown away to the dimensional gap she must want to give him her gratitude mou asia chan you are such an honest and sweet girl you are my pride vali is dangerous but i cant decline asi as request i took asias hand and then stood in front of vali vali is sitting on a chair with his legs crossed and is reading a book which looks complicated vali can i have a second what is it hyoudou issei when i urged asia she steps in fron t of vali uum thank you very much for saving me the other day hmm ah thats right well i did it out of a whim lets not worry about it much vali just looked at us once and then continued to read the book yeah well this should be okay then i took asias hand to distance her from the bastard right away i
cant get used to this guy after all hmm then another pair of people came into my sight nyan so its koneko chan and kuroka huh koneko chan is glaring at her sister while being alert and kuroka on the other hand is putting on a bewitching smile kokoneko chans sister is beautiful but she is sscary gasper is shaking behind koneko chans back oi oi gasper dont hide behind a girl is kuroka trying to pick on koneko chan again i approached them and went between the two i wont let you take koneko chan i said it to kuroka while looking at her straight koneko chan also grips tightly onto my hand and hides behind my back like i thought she still doesnt get along with her sister i need to protect her kuroka put on an astonished face for a second and then makes a naughty smile it seems like she is looking at my face hee it seems like your face became manlier since the last time i saw you nya do peopl e turn out like that when they reach balance breaker or is it because you experienced a womans body nya kuroka gives a
wink to me s shes cute shes koneko chans sister after all of course she will be cute but i also cant forget that she is al so full of evil inside her but but will koneko chan also become this beautiful when she grows up then she really will turn into a beautiful woman i started to become eager to look forward for it oh my instinct turned into lecherous thoughts this i snt the time for it i shook my head i need to protect koneko chan with my life calmly lick i took a step back at the sudden sensation j just now i felt a lick on my cheek when i looked kuroka has her tongue out flirtatiously hmm is this perh aps still a taste of a virgin nya ssorry for being a virgin since it was a bulls eye i replied back angrily more like can you actually tell that just with a taste s senjutsu definitely shouldnt be taken lightly no the one terrifying might be a nekomata hey can i ask you one favour nya what is it wont you try making a baby with me huh i became troubled at how
to reply back at the sudden proposition j just now what did she say i was puzzled and kuroka continues you know i want a child of a dragon a child from an especially strong dragon i also asked vali but he turned me down then the only one left is you human based dragon is valuable nyan and i cant ask for more if it carries the genetics from the he avenly dragon i do want to leave behind a child thats why i want someone who will give me their genes nyan what is she saying mmmy child she s saying the same thing as xenovia and unlike xenovia it seems like she is hiding something so its scary bbut are the genes of the two heavenly dragons that valuable w well they are legendary dragons after all perhaps i can make a harem using that hmm i cant imagine it if one more person says that to me maybe i can star t a business by using my genes this is very hard nyahaha you will get a bargain if its now how about we have physical contact until i get pregnant nya deal thats what i
want to say but there is a loli girl glaring from behind me so i couldnt say that kuroka laughs with joy after seeing koneko chans reaction i wont hand oversenpais mumble mumbleto nee sama i couldnt hear what koneko chan s aid half way through but it seems like it reached her sister when i looked at her reaction kuroka made a big smile then waved her hands at me and koneko chan she then went to valis place akeno san is making a sigh at the corner of the room shes b een like that ever since barakiel san came the joint forceswill it actually become successful this monkey i will eliminate you try it switch ah buchou and bikou are still fighting part 2 after sensei returned me saji and vali teleported fr om the hyoudou residence using the transportation magic circle in order to summon that dragon king we talked about even though we made special preparations we still need to succeed in summoning his consciousness the place we arrived at wasa white spa ce is it those places used for rating games stadium and such even if i look around there isnt anything remark there
was a huge dragon was waiting for us it hasnt been that long since we last met all of you oldman yes it was old man tan nin oh yeah sensei did say that we need the power of each dragon to summon mido whatever his name was so the one over there is vritra huh oldman tannin looks at saji saji himself was trembling over his whole body dddragon a dragon king the ultimate class devil it seems like his feelings were mixed with nervousness and admiration dont feel nervous old man looks scary on the outside but he is a good dragon iidiot he is the ultimate class devil tannin sama to call him an oo oldman whats wrong with saji i certainly do think old man tannin is great as well saji then says it while pointing his finger at me ultimate class devils are those that only the chosen ones can become in the underworld add to that the current top 10 rankers in the rating game are all ultimate class devils the amount of contribution the results in the game your ability you can finally reach that rank when you receive the best estimate value
in all of those areas for devils it is the best r anking there is saji says that with a fervent speech haa so he was that amazing huh ultimate class devil i also want to aim for it but wasnt the amount of contribution only possible when you have your own territory or something hmm the road to b ecome one will be hard hakuryuukou the moment you show the slightest suspicious movement i will bite you apart without hesitation oldman tannin glares at vali vali just made a bitter smile sensei activated the spell right away and he draws his p ersonal magic circle on the ground a light runs through it forming a special symbol but will that guy actually come even i only met him two or three times oldman tannin says that while making a sigh if the two heavenly dragons are here then he w ill respond whether he wants to or not sensei says that while drawing the magic circle is he a difficult dragon when i asked the old man he answers while narrowing his eyes that guy basically never moves he is one of the creatures that makes his movement at
the end of the world he is sleeping till his role is to start he has come up to the surface at times but even at those times he continued to sleep several hundred years ago he finally declared that he would continue to sleep until the end of the world a dragon like that was able to become a dragon king i dont know how they determine things at all but i did understand that he is hard to visit even if you wanted to if hes at the depth of the ocean then there is no way to meet him the base of the magic circle is completed now everyone stand at the location given being urged by sensei all of us stood on top of the points which have an unfamiliar symbol on them apparently the symbol below all of us represents the marks of the two heavenly dragons and the dragon kings when sensei confirms that we are standing in the points given he uses the small magic circle in his hand and starts to proceed to do the last input flash the shallow light runs through the magic circle and the p lace im standing
on glows red in colour and the one vali is at glows white in colour the one sensei is standing on glows gold in colour the one saji is standing on glows black in colour and the one old man tannin is standing on glows purple in colour each of them reflects the colour of each dragon ddraig explains it to me they arent here right now but blue represents tiamat and the green represents yu long hee the truth is i dont even get it even if you tell me about the colours then the m agiccircle was activated but there isnt any response and we stood there for several minutes will the consciousness of mido whatever his name is actually come i became suspicious about this but a projection of something starts to appear the project ion starts to form a shape above us i just dropped my jaw open because the vision keeps on expanding when i looked saji had the same reaction as me and what appears in front of us is a gigantic monster which seems like it fills the whole space hhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge uwaa this dragon is bigger than great red san he appears to
be a huge dragon though its head is a dragon like the old man it seems like its long body is in a coil so its a dragon which has a long skinny torso oh yeah i did hear that there are western type dragons like ddraig and the old man and also that there are eastern type dragons which are long and skinny maybe he realised i was in shock so the old man explains this guy has the biggest body out of all dragons it must have five or six times the mass of great red thththen its size is five or six hundred meters it surpasses the category of a monster i was in shock and i hear a very loud weird noise gugogogogogogooooooooon is this snoring is this dragon san sleeping like i thought hes sleeping hey wake up midgardsormr when old man tannin calls out to him the gigantic monster opens its eyes slowly this nostalgic pulse of a dragon fuaaaaaaah a single loud sigh wow what a huge mouth its so big that it can swallow the old man easily oh its tannin its been a while he has a very laid back talking
manner midgardsormrwas his name right he then looks around us even ddraig and albion are her e also fafnirand vritra is it the end of the world no it isnt we came here today because there are things we want to ask you so we summoned your consciousness to this place oldman tannin says that but gugugogogogogn midgar dsormr resumed snoring once again this guy is useless this dragon sleeps during a discussion dont sleep geez you and yu long never fixed your lazy attitude so i cant stand it oldman gets mad midgardsormr opens its big eyes once again you are always angry tannin so what is this thing you want to ask me about i want to ask you about your brother and father oldman says his brother and father you are going to ask him that didnt we come here to ask him about the countermeasure ag ainst loki and fenrir i asked about the doubt i had to sensei to begin with midgardsormr is a dragon created by loki even though it had enormous power due to its gigantic body and his lazy attitude even the norse gods didnt know how they can use h im
so they ordered him to sleep in the depth of the ocean they told him to do something at least when the end of the world was to come sso thats why he is called the sleeping dragon he really is indeed a huge sleeping dragon midgardsormr answe rs the old mans question so its about wanwan19 and daddy okay daddy and wanwan are beings i dont care about anyway ah but tannin tell me one thing what is it arent ddraig and albion going to fight he looked at me and vali with its huge eyes no they arent this time they are planning to defeat loki and fenrir by joining forces it seemed like midgardsormr smiled at old mans answer hee interesting i was wondering about it because both of them are standing together without fighting after saying that he answered his question wanwan is more troublesome than daddy you would die most of the times if you were bitt en by his fangs but he has a weakness the magic chain gleipnir created by the dwarves can capture him you can seal his movement with that wanwan huh well from the point of view from this dragon
it would be a little doggy indeed we have already ch ecked that but from the reports from the north the gleipnir didnt work thats why i thought about getting another method from you hmm i cant keep up with their conversation well it would be okay if other guys smarter than me can understand it hmm maybe daddy enhanced wanwan if thats the case then ask the dark elves living in the certain land of the norse world if i remember their elder knows a technique to power up the magic residing within the dwarves items i will transmit the locatio n of the place where the elder is living to the sacred gears of ddraig and albion sensei points at vali send the information to hakuryuukou this one has an unfortunate brain so we are having a hard time im sorry for being an idiot but dwarves an d elves really do exist huh i spoke what came to my mind thats because they are beings i only know from fantasies and movies well if i say that then it wont be weird for them to exist if angels and devils exist as well the majority of them
hid t hemselves in the other world due to the major change in the human world small groups of them still live in a secret area of the human world though vali receives the information and then speaks i understood their locations azazel activate the world map using the holographic vision when sensei opens his mobile phone and uses it the holographic image of the world map appears from the screen vali pointed at a certain point sensei sends the information of it to his comrades right away hou you a ctually know that much oldman says it to midgardsormr with admiration yeah when i went up to the land the elves and dwarves took care of me wont it be a problem if this guy is to come up hes too huge so how do we take care of loki oldman asks about loki this time yeah daddy would probably be okay if you use mjlnir against him hearing midgardsormr sensei put his hand under his chin in other words we basically have to attack him normally huh but will the thunder god thor lend us his mjlnir if that shitty geezer odin asks him i doubt thor will
let us borrow it that is one of the weapons only gods can use vali says that at senseis opinion if thats the case then ask the dwarves and dark elves i mentioned earlier they should have received the replica of mjlnir from odin we are saved thanks to your knowledge midgardsormr sensei gave his gratitude with a smile no no talking like this at times is fun now i will be going then i will be sleeping again fuaaaaa midgardsormr makes a big sigh the vision starts to turn off yeah thanks it seemed like midgardsormrs big mouth smiled at the old mans gratitude its okay wake me up again if something happens after saying that the vision turns off complete ly and he has finally disappeared midgardsormr he was a huge and weird dragon king will i meet him again like this we obtained the information from the dragon king and we started our move part 3 the next morning we finished our breakfast and gathered at the hall in the basement all of us and the sitrigroup arent going to school today well we are planning to have the familiars disguise as us and have them experience
the school life the decisive battle against loki is closing in so we hav e to take some rest all the members of our group were feeling down because they were looking forward to school life everyone loves school after all i also love it it seems like sona kaichou also felt frustrated that she can not go to school its probab ly because she is the student council president so she must feel that something might happen while im not there sensei then appeared while muttering he has a very unpleasant expression here is the present from odin the geezer the replica of mjlni r geez that shitty geezer was actually hiding this thing but that midgardsormr i cant believe he actually knew about this is it that amazing when i asked he explains it to me it is the replica of the legendary weapon wielded by the norse thund ergod thor this has the lightning of god running through it hmm that sounds amazing yes odin sama said he will lend this replica of mjlnir to sekiryuutei san here you go what i received from rossweisse san isa normal hammer it has gorgeous ornament and design on it
though please send your aura through it after rossweisse san says that to me i insert my demonic powers very strongly in it flash a single flash after that the hammer gradually starts to get bigger bang it became a gi gantic hammer which exceeds my height and it dropped down on the ground putting the grip aside the head part of the hammer became insanely big the whole hall shakes because of the impact it dug itself onto the ground because of its intense weight funnnnnnnngh i try to lift it with all my might but it doesnt even budge so heavy maybe i cant lift it unless i turn into balance breaker state perhaps but i dont think i can swing this around as i want even if i am in a balance breaker state hey hey hey you put too much aura into it keep it down sensei says it while making a sigh when i lowered my aura down like he said it got smaller and became a size just right for my hands but the weight hasnt changed ngggggh i cant lift it after all you should be able to lift it in your balance
breaker state anyway just stop for now i let go off the hammer after sensei says that to me then it returned to the original size even if its a replica it has the power close to the real thing no rmally it can only be used by a god but with barakiels help we made it so even devils can use this temporarily dont swing it around randomly okay the whole area around this place will vanish because of the high energy of thunder seriously uwaa scary hearing what sensei just said i backed down a bit so hes making me carry such a dangerous weapon ah but if i transfer my boosted power to this certainly this is a weapon appropriate for the counter measure against loki vali how about yo u beg that geezer odin as well maybe right now he might give you something special sensei says that lively please stop it would just be scary if my rival gets any stronger than he already is but vali himself just put on a fearless smile and shook hi s head dont need it im planning to master the power of the heavenly dragons original power i
dont need extra weapons what i want is something else his words just now they pierced through my heart a bit thats right he has overflowing ta lents even if he doesnt work hard like me or gets any new power he is already strong enough with his talent alone i was told that i would never beat him in amount of demonic powers and techniques even his physical ability is high even without doing an ything and i on the other hand have to work hard to attain it im jealous the one who is my rival has qualities that greatly surpass mine no i think that there is my own way of growth i will get stronger in my own way and one day i will definitely beat vali i cant give up i will definitely bikou good timing i received a message directed to you sensei then looks at bikou huh to me from who bikou points at himself and put on a doubtful face it goes fool i will punish you as soon as i find you it was from the shodai20 it seemed like he was looking for you with yu long tthat shitty geezer
is so he found out about me being a terrorist on top of that yu long too bikou started sweating a lot from his face with senseis words and he turned pale oh my i never thought that this guy who is always laughing would become so panicked hmm shodai iis he talking about the first generation sun wukong bikou should we go to your homeland once it might be interesting to meet yu long and the first generation sun wukong dont do that vali putting aside yu long who seems to be retired the first generation geeze r is a real monster he can still be considered as active that geezer has mastered senjutsu and youjutsu completely so he is really strong for this guy who bravely fought against old man tannin to get this scared that old man seems to be coming on the day of the battle so right now he is on stand by in the underworld hes such a good mental support so im happy for the old man to fight alongside us that is ah i will be reconfirming our strategy first we will wait for him to show up at the p lace
of the meeting being held then the sitri group will use their powers to transfer you guys to a different location along with loki and fenrir the location of the place you guys will be transferred to is a demolished stone pitting site the ones takin g on loki will be ise and vali we will counter him with the two heavenly dragons the ones taking on fenrir would be the other members of the gremory team and vali team who will use the chain to capture it i will have you guys eliminate it after that we definitely cant let fenrir get to odin the fangs of that wolf can crush a god even if it is the chief god odin he will die if bitten with those fangs we have to stop that from happening at any cost that is our plan the sitri group will transfer us along with the enemy then me and vali will take on loki we are leaving fenrir to the other guys such pressure my opponent is a god after all even if vali is with me that doesnt mean that i will be safe due to the enemy we are facing
hehehe you really cant tell what will happen in your life now since we left the chain to the elder from the dark elves we just have to wait for it to be completed so what is left is saji sensei calls saji what is it azazel sensei you are also impo rtant for this strategy you do have the vritra sacred gear after all saji becomes so shocked that his eyes were about to pop out at senseis words plplease hold on a second ii dont have insane power like hyoudou and hakuryuukou i wont be able to fight by taking on a god and fenrir i thought i just have to transfer everyone with kaichou and others hes panicking certainly sajis ability is effective but it will definitely be hard for him to take on a god and fenrir sensei made a sigh whil e knowing that i know i wont say things like to fight in the front line to you but i will have you support your allies with vritras power especially ise and vali who are fighting in the front line need your support ssupport for that you wil l need a bit of training
there is something i want to try out sona i will borrow this guy for a bit sensei asks kaichou that is okay but to where im taking him to the fallen angels territory in the underworld grigoris institute sensei has a cheerful face ah i know this face it must be hell training this is from my experience but those who get dragged into something when sensei shows a cheerful face like that will see hell only a few months have passed since i met him but i have come t o understand that part of sensei saji senseis training is hell i almost died in the underworld as well on top of that you are going to the laboratory institute you are dead i put my hands on my friends shoulder and looked at him with pity in my e yes hearing that saji gets even more scared hahaha then lets get going saji sensei grabs on sajis collar who is resisting and he started to activate the magic circle seriously h help meeeeee hyoudoooooou kaichoooooou the magic starts to em it a light and glow and it envelops the crying saji goodbye saji i will never forget
you well putting that aside saji will be our support what is sensei planning in the battle against you vritra who was sleeping inside that boy started to wake up it must have something to do with that ddraig says that ha i see im looking forward to see what will happen by the way ddraig arent you going to talk to albion its a reunion after all i thought there was going to be some conversatio n no there isnt anything to talk about right white one ddraig says it so everyone can hear but dont talk to me i dont have a rival called chichiryuutei albions response was a harsh one oh my wwait its a misunderstanding the o ne who is called chichiryuutei is my host hyoudou issei ddraig tries to defend himself oi are you trying to put all the blame on me wait this is certainly my fault to awaken by pressing b breasts and to deactivate from juggernaut drive by pre ssing breasts this is so horrible that i want to cry red one albions tone is mixed with disappointment hearing that our ddraig started crying i also wept my tears never stop uooooooon
sob how did this happen we were supposed to be the prideful two heavenly dragons do you know how i felt when i saw a hero television programme which portrayed my rival as oppai dragon sob wwhat is this the legendary dragons the two dragons who were called the two heavenly dragons arec rying i felt complicated at this situation but vali was also troubled on how to respond albion are you crying again you were also weeping when we were watching the television programme which portrays hyoudou issei something like that happened i made the two heavenly dragons cry vali then asks me while putting on a troubled face im sorry hyoudou issei at times like this how should i comfort him like hell i know dont ask me as a start im sorry i am an oppai dragon after all geez i dont care what happens anymore while irrelevant things like that were occurring we continued our preparations for the battle against loki part 4 while the preparations are progressing me and buchou were trying to confirm how the thunder hammer mjlnir works then a magic circle appeared and a silver haired maid comes out from it its
grayfia san she appears to be carrying documents ojou sama here are the documents regarding the magical chain gleipnir on the day of the battle it is scheduled for the chain to be sent directly to the battlefield thank you grayfia buchou receives the documents from her and starts to look through them then i had something i wanted to ask them because both buchou and grayfia san are here i then ask them timidly uumm since buchou and grayfia san are here there is something i want to ask grayfia san looks at me with her cool eyes sirzechs samas queen and his wife and she is also millicas samas mother what is it u umm i was a bit hesitant to say it but i finally made my mind up and said it its about akeno san why isnt she getting along with her father i dont see barakiel san as a bad father buchou and grayfia san look at each other after that buchou finally spo ke its a sad past akeno sans mother was a miko21 from a certain famous temple her name was himejima shuri it seems like akeno san use d her mothers surname
then one day barakiel san flew near the temple where akeno sans mother was present after being heavily wounded in a battle against enemy forces akeno sans mother saved the wounded leader of the fallen angels and she nursed him back to health himejima akenos mother got into a close relationship with barakiel dono during then and it was as if she had a new life inside of her grayfia san tells me buchou then continues barakiel couldnt leave akenos mother and akeno so h e stayed there while fulfilling the role of the fallen angels leader even though they had a quiet lifestyle they still had a peaceful life but their peace didnt last long her mothers family got into a misunderstanding thinking that she had been b rainwashed by the fallen angels leader with black wings so they sent out a famous jutsusha22 well they could have been fended off with barak ielsans power but among the jutsusha there were those who had a grudge against barakiel san after being defeated by him those jutsusha told the location of barakiel donos house to the ones who were in conflict with the fallen angels when grayfia san said that
buchou put on sad eyes he must have been unlucky on that day barakiel was away from his home by chance the enemy attacked the house where akeno and her mother lived without any hesitation by the time barakiel sensed the danger and arriv ed akeno was saved because her mother protected her with her life but akenos mother was after that akeno san was told about how much her fatherhow the fallen angels had many grudges against them from lots of people in the enemy forces then she was shown what reality was when her mother was killed right in front of her eyes since that day himejima akeno didnt hold any good views towards the fallen angels she then had regrets of her mother being killed and closed her heart to barakiel dono i became speechless at grayfia sans words i never thought such an extreme thing happened it surpassed what i imagined a few years after that akeno san who was a half fallen angel was chased out from her house and she was alone wandering vari ous places it was then that she met buchou but you know ise when akeno became my servant and started
her new life as a devil she became brighter compared to before most of all her view towards fallen angels lightened after meeting youthe thing about her mother passing away is something no one can fix and akeno should also know that deep in her heart but akeno isnt strong enough to accept that yet part 5 it was all my fault after hearing about akeno san i told about what i heard to sensei who was working in the vip room just by himself and sensei also started talking about it that it was his fault that day the one who called him out was me there was a mission which could only be accomplished by him thats why i called him ou t recklessly during that short time i was the one who took away his wife and her mother from barakiel and akeno sensei is that why you tried to look after akeno san in place of barakiel san sensei didnt stop working and he didnt say anything then there was someone who entered the room azazel i have returned it was vali ah so its you how is it vali put his hand forward at senseis
word and then activated a small magic circle in the air this is the emblem carved on th e magic circle resembles the ones used by the norse gods i learnt quite a bit of norse magic i should be able to withstand lokis attack for some time what vali is carrying in his hand is a book which he has been reading this whole time dont tell me that he has been reading a book to learn norse magic to fight against loki in this short time he is gifted and talented in using his demonic powers but for him to learn that in such a short time sensei nods after confirming that understood okay since i finished quite a bit of work i will rest for a bit leaving me and vali sensei left the room me and vali are left behind a weird tension passes through the room vali sat on the sofa and i sat on a chair a bit away from him he is reading the book from before vali had been going outside with bikou when he wasnt needed he basically comes to my house when needed he probably doesnt want to affiliate with
us as much as possible well that goes the same for us as well i was also a bout to leave but i started to feel like talking to this guy for a bit i cant think of anything to talk about so i scratched my head and then spoke you know even if he is an evil god i still didnt expect to fight a god i didnt expect any answer coming from him but he surprised me and answered my question while reading the book you should remember this if there are good gods then there are also evil gods well there are situations when even good gods can be seen as evil from differen t perspectives evil god huh why does he hate peace im a devil but i feel satisfied just by enjoying my days with buchou and everyone vali stops reading and says it while looking directly at me it means there are people who consider your so called peace to be a painful situation pain huh so does it mean the perspective of enjoying life changes with the individual and the position they are in that is something very sad i dont want to
participate in a war hmm i feel people would be at peace after knowing the greatness of oppai is the current world we live in a pain to you vali looks up at the ceiling at my question i just find it boring thats why i cant feel anything but joy for this joint battle his mouth was lifted up s o much that it scares me a battle maniac huh he must really love fighting it sure does make me hate it since there are many strong guys but because of that this world is interesting i will become stronger than everyone valis dream huh eve n though he is the same heavenly dragon as me his dream is different from mine iwill become the ultimate pawn and i will be alright if i can become a high class devil im aiming to make my own kind of a harem well if i can aim for it i want to become an ultimate class devil but it seems like i need to do something in my own territory ah maybe i can make a big business with oppai dragon hmm will it work ah but this certainly expands my
dream it certainly sounds like you vali was smi ling ah i still have one more aim yeah i forgot the very important one i said it while looking directly at vali i will definitely surpass you hearing that vali put on a very happy smile which i have never seen before and then says it yeah you should come up to the place where i am standing it makes me happy as you get stronger there was a time when i felt disappointed because you were a sekiryuutei with no talent and who was weak but you are trying to grow in a different way from all the sekiryuutei until now you must be the first one to try to master the power of sekiryuutei while communicating with ddraig is it true ddraig that is correct i said it before remember that you are the first host to talk to me this much in the whol e of history and you dont drown too much in my power you dont rely too much on my power and you are trying to master the sekiryuuteis power vali continues after ddraig they were all hosts who used that very powerful and
dangerous power as they wi shed in the end they drowned in ddraigs power and perished in the battle you are the sekiryuutei with the least talent in history your power and everything else is weak but you are the first sekiryuutei who is trying to master the power of sek iryuutei having ddraig and vali say that to me i became a bit embarrassed is it just me or does it seem like you guys have higher expectations of me than i have of myself that puts pressure on me in a different way albion also speaks users like tha t are the most troublesome when we oppose them they dont show many openings vali agrees at his comments you are right and just now i had a thought in the future it might be interesting to have a match similar to a rating game with my team and you r team a game between my team and valis team huh yeah yeah yeah somehow that seems fun im not sure why but only that match seems very fun hee that seems good im going to get stronger and get the best servants there is you know on top
of that they will all be beautiful women and beautiful girls fufufu then i shall be looking forward for that time to come and ill wait though it will seem like i would have to fight against the gremory team first one day lets battle each other rias gremorys group also wont lose to you guys but dont come at us like how a terrorist does fufufu i cant promise that i dont know when that time will come but i want to defeat this guyvali yes yes it certainly is wonderful i can feel the youth from you two wow odin the geezer appeared between me and vali out of nowhere did he finish his business it seems like he was moved very much emotionally the red and white of this generation are unique the ones in the past were all wild ho rses they rampaged in every location they started the battle between the red and white selfishly while destroying the surroundings and then died they activated juggernaut drive when they felt like it just think how many mountains and islands were bl own away geezer says that while making a sigh rossweisse san who is behind him
then says it certainly one of them is a lecherous dragon and the other one is a terrorist which makes a very dangerous pairing but you two are calmer than i thought i thought fighting each other immediately is the way of the sekiryuutei and hakuryuukou im sorry for being lecherous but it certainly seems like me and vali are unique heavenly dragons so what are the difference between our senpai23 and us ah perhaps the key to convince the thoughts of the past senpai lies there by the way hakuryuukou which partdo you like geezer asks vali with pervert ed eyes dont tell me this geezer is trying to talk erotic things with the hakuryuukou what are you talking about vali asks while tilting his head then the geezer starts to point at rossweisse sans breast butt and then her thighs the womens body part that you like this sekiryuutei over here loves breasts thats why i thought you also have a fetish like that unthinkable im no oppai dragon vali says that with a vexing expression im sorry this is all my fault now now you are also a man there should be body parts that you like
in a woman i dont take interest in those kinds of thing that much if i had to choose then it would be the hip i think the line from their waist to their hip is the part which symbolises the beauty of a woman when vali answers like that i see so that makes you a ketsuryuukou24 when geezer said that nnuoooooooooon it seem s like albion was flooding his tears out i then say it to the geezer geezer please stop right now the two heavenly dragons have entered their delicate season even i started to feel pity for ddraig and albion maybe these two received a shock which makes them cry for the first time in their life im thinking of treating ddraig better from now albion do not cry i will listen to your worries anytime vali just said kind words to his partner everyone the two heavenly dragons have entered thei r delicate season such a pitiful dragon yes maybe a fairy tale will be made about a pitiful dragon one day geezer i will seriously get mad geezer then says it after making a single cough like i thought young ones are good suddenly
he started to talk like an old man what do you mean when i ask he answers while stroking his beard nothing much until this age this geezer right in front of you believed that he can solve anything with his wisdom but you know that was just the prid e of this old man what is truly important is the possibility of the young ones hohoho i started to realise that right now so how foolish was i my pride gave birth to loki and now because of my pride the young ones are going through hardships geezers eye was filled with sorrow hmmm i really cant understand how important people think i dont really get it but wouldnt it be okay just to take it one step at a time i said it without thinking that is something i believe in all the time but the geezer put on a shocked face wwhat is it with that reaction then this time he stared laugh kukuku as if he found it amusing being young is good they stimulate the old ones yeah you are right that is very true i dont quite get it but the geezer had a
satisfied face part 6 in the empty room i was in a zazen25 posture with my upper body naked and just wearing my pants this is to concentrate and sink my consciousness into the sacred gear im doing what sensei told me to do this is all to find the new possibility i send my consciousness deep into it for 30 minutes but haaa i felt my limit and took a brea th after breaking my posture its useless i send my consciousness into the sacred gear with ddraigs help i was swimming in the darkness and even if i pass through it there is only a white space there are many tables and chairs and people who seem to look like the past sekiryuuteis are sitting there everyone had a hollow expression as if they dont have any thoughts it cant be helped since they are fragments of their thoughts perhaps according to ddraig they regain their consciousness only duri ng the juggernaut drive and they continue to say the cursed chant of the juggernaut drive to encourage me to go berserk anyway i tried to talk to each of thembut i didnt get any response the burden on
me mentally is great so i wont be able to sink into my consciousness for long so i came back without any progress today it seems like this will be quite a pain will the power of sekiryuutei go onto another stage by persuading the past hosts either way i will stay strong by doing a zazen posture and continue to do this tomorrow i think continuing to do things is the way to progress door open the door opens when i looked up to see if someone entered andakeno san wearing a white cloth came in huh she sucked the dragon power which was charged within my arm just recently so i dont think i need it yet she closes the door behind her lock was that the sound of locking the door akeno san has her hair down it seems like she is lacking in judgement and there is a charm in h er expression isekun yes even though she spoke akeno sans tone sounds low akeno san stood in front of me after walking towards me slowly then akeno san unties her obi26and then shesheshe drop the white cloth drops on the floor flow blood floods out
from my nose t thats because in front of me akeno san is wearing nothing and is in the state she was born in a white naked body it isnt just her oppai that are visible my body became stiff at this intense situation oooooppai that isnt the only thing i cant move and akeno san approaches me while putting her hand around my neck she then hugs meeeeeee munyuu mnyuuun akeno sans oppai her arms her thighs her everything they all envelop meeee the womans soft and very elastic body blew my brain away aaaaaaaah akeno sans bodywhy is it so tender smooth and soft on my chest akeno sans oppai gets pressed down her whole oppai her nipples are touching me as weeeeell i couldnt move because of the sensation of the womans soft body i can smell a sweet perfume from akeno sans silky black hair aaaah why do girls smell this good her perfume hits my nose and my brain becomes a flower garden then akeno san whispers in my ear make love to me massive nosebleed for a moment my brain froze then after that my nosebleed bursts out mmakelove to heeeeer its mostly in
the top r ank of things you want a girl to say to you and i never thought i would get to hear that from akeno san more than that is she serious ssoso that means you mean to do that right akeno san hugs me with her full naked body and the sensation of he r oppai is amazing and her white skin is so bright and both my hands wander around because i dont know where they should go my first experience so my first partner is akeno san akeno san looks straight at me and our eyes met her expression seems a bit lifeless and it seemed like she doesnt care and is in self abandonment akeno san approaches my face and she closing in to try and kiss me if i kiss her like this i would probably push akeno san down and we might do it till the end such a n amazing chance has come maybe this is the most luckiest event in my whole life but even still this isnt right i put my hand on akeno sans shoulder and pushed her away from my body akeno sans skin that can be felt
through my hands is soft a nd that alone is enough to blow my instinct away but i have to endure because this isnt right why is my body not attractive akeno san asks me with a shaking voice it sounds as though she thought i would make love to her like this i thought t heres no point to lie so i told her my true thoughts ttthat isnt true its the best i never get bored of akeno sans enormous and large oppai no matter how many times i touch them i want to grab on to your butt i also want stroke around your hip s i also want to massage your thighs which have the right thickness i want to enjoy every part of akeno san and lastly i want to sink my face on your breast then you can do that you know iwant you to do that to me i want to give my body to yo u and be embraced with your chest and get rid of everything they are right in front of your eyes and you can have them by pushing me down but why ththen why do you have such
a sad face it seems like akeno san regained her proper consciousness with my words i continue when you do ecchi things to me akeno san you always seem to be having fun but right now it seems like akeno san is doing this to forget about a painful memory thats right what would you do if i said tha t im trying to feel relieved by making love with you and head towards the battle i thought that i can get rid of this feeling if i make love with you tthat is wrong even if she feels relieved that will only last for a short time then akeno san wont be able to go forward i picked up the white cloth that akeno san took off and put it over her body i then hugged her gently i felt her soft body once again and my brain was about to go crazy again but i tried hard to stay no rmal and then told her i will just stay like this and hug you i wont do ecchi things to you ii am lecherous i really want to have sex with akeno san but i dont want to
make love with you with these kind of feelings ise kun i heard about akeno sans past im an idiot so i cant say anything good for the burden she is carrying but if akeno san is relying on me then i will just hug her like this until she feels safe akeno san doesnt answer i think akeno sans feelings becam e a bit weird because she remembered her past after reuniting with her father thats why she tried to get a false sense of relief by getting embraced by mea man instead that would leave a scar in akeno san she will definitely regret it i thought i s hould tell her my true feelings i whisper to akeno sans ear while hugging her i will stay by your side i will always stay by your side whenever you feel sad i will hug you like this anytime so please please cheer up the only thing i could do is to hug her gently such an idiot both meand you even if i am an idiot i will protect akeno san ise thank you i love you her voice is mixed with crying sounds it has a mixed
feeling of insecurity i hugged akeno san gently like this until she left me akeno san if it is me you want then i will always stay with you thats why please return to the way you were akeno san part 7 the night that day me buchou and asia are sleeping on the bed buchou and asia are already asleep but i couldnt sleep because i was thinking there was the incident with akeno san as well and also the battle is coming up somehow it feels like many things happened today its been a short while but a lot of things occurred i talked to vali i me t a dragon king i heard about akeno san i heard about senseis feelings im glad i didnt hurt akeno san shiver my body suddenly trembles im feeling nervous i know why its because the battle is coming up im feeling scared my opponent is a god after all of course i would feel scared i want to run away right this moment if i can i dont want to fight thats because i might die but i cant do that hearing sirzechs samas thoughts buchou is trying to do
this i can only believe in bu chou and head forward to protect my comrades to protect the woman i love i need to overcome this with my power cant sleep buchous voice when i turned my body around buchou was there smiling at me akeno had a bright expression you did som ething to her right crap ddid she find out about it we didnt have ssex i say that while looking away seeing my reaction buchou pinches my cheek with her eyes half opened i didnt ask to hear that you really didnt do it yyes im still a virgin hearing that she stops pinching me very well phew buchou has a strict check on her servants when i was touching my cheek which became sore buchou took my hand and grope aaah this is it this is buchous op pai its smooth its elasticity it sticks forward and it is very enormous and soft my five fingers are receiving the best sensation there is i remember buchous oppai when i think of a sensation of oppai inside me i have a rule that oppaibuchous oppai uummbuchou i got a nosebleed while resting down on the bed buchou
then says it gently my heart is beating fast right of course it is we are going to fight against a god i also feel nervous i can feel b uchous heartbeat through my hand i certainly can b but why are you letting me touch your oppai ufufu during the event in the underworld i promised you that i will let you touch them remember also i thought that this was the best way to make you relax you cant go to sleep because you are nervous right she sure knows everything you are really amazing buchou you will be fighting in the frontline you have a crucial role a fight against a god so you are worried whether you can accompli sh that you cant go to sleep because you are worried about them right to be expected from my onee sama she saw through everything yes these roles are scary its an honour but i feel uneasy because i dont know if i can fulfil these roles i also wonder what would happen to everyone if we fail tomorrow i feel uneasy due to being nervous and the pressure on me i blurted out my weak thoughts
i never say to buchou why is this i cant blurt out these feelings to anyone but i can say it natur ally when i am touching buchous oppai and i also feel safe its okay you can say those things in front of me i love ise even including those parts about you i can show my honest feelings only to buchou i probably cant show this side of me to as ia or akeno san since its buchou i buchous oppai are very soft and i can calm down when i am touching them buchous oppai are really mysterious maybe its because im an oppai dragon so i started to get peace of mind when im touching your oppai buchou stokes my cheek with her hand i dont care if you are an oppai dragon ise is my pride so get even stronger your dream of becoming an ultimate pawn i also believe in it buchou if you can get stronger and feel comfort by touching m y breast then i dont mind being a switch princess the switch princess that only belongs to you if i can become the source of your power then that will fulfil
my wish my adorable ise buchous face approaches mine my lips and buchous lips overla p each other our third kiss it was much longer than usual and we kissed while doing it more gently buchou i will become stronger for you and my comrades odin yo geezer the meeting is starting soon our preparations are progressing accordingly as well so its you azazel boy hmmm what is it you are putting on a rare serious face i started to think that my ways of governing are causing trouble to those in my homeland and the young ones here i hated the norse guys who have old ways of thinking and shunning themselves doing nothing but you came out the chief god himself came out to the front stage you came to us who are trying to create a cooperation with other factions i am a geezer after all sometimes i feel like listening to the thoughts of the young ones and also by thinking about the future of the young ones in my world i think that i need to prepare a new path for them try to make that dream real geezer you came here to talk to
the japanese gods for that reason right you looked around this country under their religion while saying you were sightseeing so you have to finish the meeting safely we will help you with it hmm i know that even if you dont tell me i will make you tag along with me in drinking sake today youngster life4 two heavenly dragons vs evil god loki part 1 i wish for an oppai maid caf rejected buchou rejects my suggestion while making a sigh the club activity for the day was to plan what we will be doing for the school festival its a busy time right now but we still need to choose them before hand we are allowed to attend school just for today and for my suggestion i chose maid caf also with oppai buchou and akeno san if we do a caf using the two great oneesamas as our maids then we can most likely get the most sales within the whole school but if we do that other males would see buchou and akeno sans oppai you know i became shoc ked at kibas comment t that is true if that happens then other bastards besides
me would see buchou and akeno sans oppai i cant allow that i am the only one who can see and enjoy their oppai ku such a regret then we also wont be able to do o ppai haunted house either you were also thinking such a thing like that dosukebe27senpai even koneko chan was astounded by my stupid op inion i feel disappointed and buchou says it to me while making a sigh you know ise using an ecchi theme certainly seems like we can get lots of customers but the student council wont allow it and the teachers will also reject the idea ah thats certainly true its exactly like what you said but if that is the case what are we going to do will it be the same as last year but buchou rejected that idea by saying i dont want to repeat the same thing and no ecchi if i think about it other clubs are also doing maid caf though if we do the same maid caf as them we can still beat them the girls in our club are of high level beauty but that was also a no no since buchou doesnt
want to do the same thing as others even when buchou asks ev ery single member no one could give a new idea which sounds interesting i will quote the trait that we have occult type researchit wont be a hot topic rather the one which would become a hot topic are the two great onee sama koneko chan who is a loli and cute the famous 2nd year beauty trio of asia irina and xenovia gasper who is very popular among a certain group of guys and the idol of the school girls kiba and lastly the famous lecherous guy of this school me yup everyone besides me i s popular shit i feel like crying ah but wait if you dont include me and kiba other members are popular amongst guys you can say gasper is also seen as a girl i hear that he hangs around with girls in his class girls are worried about gasper if he was thrown into a group of guys because they might do something to him so the girls look after him how about a contest to find out who is the most popular girl in the occult research club for
example its something i blurted out without thinkin g muchthen the girls look at each other im curious which one of the two great onee samas is the most popular its something gasper said then buchou and akeno san look at each other there is no doubt i am the most popular buchou and akeno sans words overlap each other and then they glared at each other they both have a smile on but they have a very scary aura around them ara buchou did you say something you too akeno didnt you just say something i can not ignore im glad that akeno san is starting to turn back to her usual self but scary its really scary since it seems like they are about to start a big battle right now like this the two of them started to have a quarrel and the meeting was dismissed it was decide d that we would choose what to do for the school festival on another day will we really be able to decide this before the school trip azazel sensei was looking at our meeting quietly while drinking green tea at the corner of the room this whole time
but now he is looking outside the window where it is getting dark he then spoke so its already dusk hearing that everyone put on a serious face yes after this we have to battle loki the school bell which signals the end of club time is heard its still too early for a ragnarok you guys we are going all out yes we raised our spirits with senseis word and the time for the battle has come part 2 the time for battle the sun has already set and its night we were at the rooftop of a highrated hotel building in the suburb where the place of the meeting of odin the geezer and the japanese gods will be held maybe because we are standing in a very high place the breeze here is very violent on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings the members of the sitri group are positioned on standby i could also discern a person standing afar saji said he would come latei wonder what kind of training he is being forced to do saji kun whatever you do dont show up after the battle sensei has to be the middleman for the meeting
so he is staying beside the geezer replacing sensei who cant participate in this battle barakiel san is on standby with us on the roof rossweisse san is also participating in this battle so she is wearing her armour while on standby and very high up in the sky old man tannin is there if he flies up there like that he will be seen by humans and it could make things chaotic so he has a spell cast on him so that normal humans wont be able to see him vali and his team are waiting for the battle a bit further away from us its time buchou says that while looking at her wrist watch its now time for the meeting to start this means that an important discussion has started in one of the rooms inside t he hotel now whats left is to wait for that guy to come what should we do if he doesnt come like he promised maybe hes already inside the hotel disguised and trying to approach the geezer no tricks huh you have my respect vali made a bitter smile something happened the moment i thought that break break the sky
above the hotel started to become distorted and a big hole was created the one who appeared from the hole wasthe evil god loki and the giant ash grey wolf fenrir they appeared to us head on target confirmed mission start when barakiel san said that from the small communication device on his ear a gigantic barrier type magic circle was activated around the hotel the sitri group lead by kaichou activated the magic circle in order to transfer us loki and fenrir to the battlefield loki senses that but he just showed a smirk and didnt retaliate we were then covered in light when i opened my eyes it was just a spacious field its filled with rock s if i remember this was supposed to be an abandoned ancient mine apparently it isnt used now i confirmed my group members led by buchou everyone is here including irina barakiel san and rossweisse san are also here vali and his team are also here a bit away from us and in front of us are loki and fenrir i started my countdown for the balance breaker as soon as i confirmed them so you arent fleeing when buchou said
it with sarcasm loki laughed there is no need for me to flee all of you will retaliate anyway so i finish you all here and then i can go back to the hotel its just a matter of time even if he does or doesnt participate in the meeting i will have odin disappear you are wrapped with dangerous thoughts barakiel san say s that the first one to have a dangerous idea was your side an alliance between each faction to begin with when the three great powers recorded in the bible decided to have an alliance everything became distorted looks like you have no intention of talking barakiel san started to cover his hand with the holy lightning from his back 10 black wings appeared and my countdown has completed i do a promotion balance break immediately welsh dragon balance breaker flash while releasing a red light the power of sekiryuutei is materialised as armour on my body okay i can feel my power rising vanish dragon balance breaker vali is also enveloped in a spotless white plate armour vali and i step in front of loki at the same time seeing that loki becomes overjoyed this
is wonderful so the two heavenly dragons will be joining forces to defeat this loki my heart has never raced like this swish vali made his move he moved in the sky while creating a course of ligh t in a zig zag and closed his distance with loki at high speed i also ignited the thrusters on my back along with his movement from the sky vali and from the ground i go heading towards him a combination between the red and the white most likely im the first one to get a fight like this loki is very lively and he activates a wide range of defensive magic circles which covers his whole body when i thought like that the countless magical lights which appeared from the magic circles turned into a sash being released towards us it seems like its an attack with a high level of power which can follow the enemy many sashes of light are released towards vali who is flying around the sky even dozens of its attacks are shot towards me vali flies around in an acrobatic style in the sky and he dodges all of the attacks i just went ahead
without caring whether the attack hits me or not stab stab stab the magical attack pierces through my body but an attack like this is nothing i will close my distance with him right away gathering the strength to my right fist i fly towards loki who is at a low altitude with full speed i have my dragon wings appear from my back boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost break i charge forward and the magic circles surrounding loki all perish after making a noise from there vali releases an insane demonic power attack at him an equation besides the demonic power appears within valis hand is that the norse magic which he just learned as a start here is my first move baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan he shot it i leave the spot immediately that was dangerous that bastard attacked without even waiting for a moment as soon as i broke lokis defence it was an attack which covers one third of the area of this mining place what an insane attack its outrageouuuuuuuus after the attack ended a huge bottomless hole is created at the spot where loki was standing before he probably narrowed the attack range but a single attack of his has an
insane attack power once again i realised it my rival isnt normal fuhahahaha i started to hear someone laughing out loud when i looked at the direction where the laugh came from i saw a man floating in the air its loki his robe is a bit torn but it seems like loki himself is unscathed hes unscathed after receiving an attack like that this god is truly terrifying if it turned out like this i will use the secret weapon i grabbed on the hammer which is l ocated on my hip the mjlnir and send my demonic power through it to make it a convenient size i was barely able to lift it with my hands but i slammed it towards loki lokis eyes started to twitch mjlnir the replica even so you are carryin g a dangerous weapon over there damn odin does he want to make the meeting successful that much he seems pissed at odin the geezer for giving this away rather than the fact that i have this right now in my normal state this would have been too h eavy to carry but right now i am barely able to lift it with
my balance breaker state i ignited the booster on my back while having the posture of lifting the hammer up goooooooon i head towards loki at very fast speed and i slam down my hammer once i grasped sight of my target come out the thunder which can even defeat a god i release it while saying that in my head dooooooooooooooon loki dodges it a huge crater was created on the groundbut the actual thunder didnt come out whats the me aning of this wasnt this supposed to release a thunder which can even paralyse a god i swing it down a couple of timesbut even a slight buzz of the thunder didnt come out is this a defective produccccccct fuhahaha loki laughs at the miserable state im in its unfortunate that hammer can only be used by someone with a very strong and pure heart you must have some evil feelings within your heart thats why it doesnt create lighting normally i hear that doesnt have any weight and is as light as a feather you know seriously evil feeling y yeah i do understand what he means im lecherous after all so i cant use it because
im the oppai dragon its about time that i start to attack seriously then when loki clicks his fingers fenrir who was just observing till now steps forward the fangs which can kill god my servant fenrir who has such fangs you will meet your demise even with a single bite if you two can defeat this beast then come and get it loki gives an o rder to fenrir and that moment buchou raised her hand nyan buuuuiiiiiiiiiiin at the same time kuroka smiled magic circles are activated around her and a very big and thick chain comes out of it the magical chain gleipnir it was fortunate that we received it earlier than we anticipated but because it was very hard to carry it kuroka hid it inside her personal territory having been led by old man tannin and barakiel san my comrades and valis comrades grabbed on to the chain and then threw i t towards fenrir fuhahahahaha its useless countermeasures against gleipnir were already leaving loki laughing out loud behind the magical chain which was enhanced by the dark elves wraps around fenrirs body as if it has its own consciousness ooooooooooooooooooon the giant wolf howls
painfully which echoes throughout the area fenrir captured barakiel san says that while looking at fenrir which cant move its body yes they have succeeded in capturing fenrir amazing its perfect t he dark elves whom we never met sure did an outstanding job if fenrirs movements are sealed the group can defeat it with ease as long as they dont let their guard down then this means that loki is the only one left i thought that the evil god would panic by having fenrirs movement sealed but hes still laughing creepily does he still have something up his sleeve when i was being suspicious of him loki spread his arms wide their specs are lower but the space on both sides of loki become d istorted w what what is he planning to from the distortion created in the space a new thing appears ashgrey fur sharp claws eyes without any emotion and a very wide opened mouth skll hati it howls loudly towards the sky as if it respo nded to lokis call ooooooooooooooooooooon oooooooooooooooooooooon the cloud under the night is blown away and a full moon giving out a gold colour appears having the moon shine
on them the two giant beastsno the wolves howled fenrir no way why how it wasnt just one of them not only me but everyone else also had a shocked face no only vali seemed like he was having fun having the two new fenrir obeying him loki then says it i changed a jtunn28 woman living in jrnvir29 to a wolf and made it breed with fenr ir as a result these two were born their specs are quite a bit lower than their father but their fangs are the real thing they can easily kill a god and all of you so fenrir had children how the heck should i know that midgardsormr didnt te ll us anything about this it must mean that dragon didnt know about this as well this is the worst loki sends out an order to the two fenrir go skll and hati that bunch of people are the ones who captured your father tear and rip them apart with those claws and fangs of yours swish along with the sound of wind the two wolves headed towards my comrades one of them headed to valis team the other one headed toward the
gremory group ku there arent any more chains they used the chain on the parent fenrir after all hmph a mere dog goooooooon oldman tannin breathed out a powerful flame from his mouth wow to be expected from the former dragon king he enveloped the child fenrir with his intense flame but the child fenrir is moving inside the flame as if nothing has happened it has received damage but it didnt flinch at all those two fenrir have to be defeated head on when i looked towards my comrades loki shot out a huge magical attack ball gugaaan i dodged it just before it hit me but it wiped away the part of my armour which it grazed getting hit by it directly would be bad like i thought a god is a god even if he is called an evil god so it means he can destroy boosted gear scalemail i wont be able to activate t he power to halve if my opponent is a god class so i will have myself reduce your power slowly don don dooooooon vali created many attacks made from his demonic power which are mixed with the norse magic formula and
he shoots them out each of them gets taken down by lokis magical power but not all of them could be wiped out so several of them hit lokis body but he didnt receive any remarkable damage to be expected from the hakuryuukou it seems like you learned the norse magic in such a sho rt time but its still not enough loki releases a wave of magical power which is glowing like a rainbow vali makes his wings bigger and it seems like he is planning to take it head on dividedividedividedividedividedividedividedivide the divine dividings ability was activated and lokis attack continues to get smaller it seems like i can use my ability to halve without touching it if its an attack like this but this consumes a lot from me is it an applied technique of his move wh ich halves his territory even if it doesnt affect lokis body it works on his attack it seems like he is also growing and attaining new ability scary but several of the attacks he released hit and pierce through valis armour the divine dividing scalemail gets damaged heavily but vali repairs it immediately goooooooooooooooo boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost i also shot my
super special dragon shot towards loki without any pause if i cant use the hamme r then i have to attack him like this doooon my shot goes towards him but loki puts on a ghastly expression and takes my attack front on don he then made it go towards valis direction my dragon shot was heading towards vali but vali evades it by moving with a fast velocity fuhahahaha hakuryuukou has a more proficient strength while the sekiryuutei has an intense spirit in his attack you dont have techniques but i cant take you lightly hmmm amazing a blow which is filled with spirit rin gs a bell to peoples hearts just how much feeling did you put inside that attack just now it seems like loki who stopped my attack has a bit of smoke emitting from his hands he isnt an opponent i cant defeat huh it would be impossible by mysel f but if im with vali then there is a possibility that we can win if i still have some energy left i should transfer my power to vali or my comrades but i was told before that if i were to take the supporting
role the enemy would concentrate the ir attack at me along with my comrades rather than the hakuryuukou who moves in high speed its certain that it is much easier to capture the sekiryuutei if you were to transfer your multiplied power it would be just bothersome thats why i will kill you first oh my so he read through what i was thinking loki directs his hand at me hes planning to take me down first ignoring me is something i cant accept buun vali moves immediately and went behind loki who was aiming his attack at me he can pull it off vali has gathered an enormous amount of demonic power to his hand and he is trying to release his blow if that hits then even loki wont bite valiwas eaten by fenrirs large mouth which suddenly appeared from his side guhaa vali spurts out blood the fangs easily destroy the white armour with ease and valis body has been pierced through completely valis blood taints fenrirs mouth in red its not the child fenrir its the parent fenrir why is the parent fenrir here when i looked there isnt a chain on him perhaps when i
turned around the child fenrir had the chain in its mouth it acted as if it was fighting my comrades and then freed its parent fuhahahaha looks like i have the hakuryuukou crunched first loki laughs loudly vali i charge towards fenrir to rescue vali i turned the size of the hammer to its original size it certainly didnt go like how we planned vali if you go down here then our strategy wont work accordingly i dont want to admit it but we need your power for this fight not even flinching against my charge fenrir gets ready to take my attack head on so it doesnt think my attack is scary huh you damn dog i try to do a straight punch to its nose but zashun it sla shes down with its front paw it easily broke my boosted gear scalemail ouch gough from my stomach and from my mouth blood burst out this is bad if vali is down and even the only vanguard left which is me also goes down ngh i wont let you take down those two oldman tannin backs us up by breathing out a fireball its a fire with insane heat
and mass but like i thought fenrir shows no sign of running away battle of monsters their sizes are about the same if thats the case then drag on looks stronger than a wolf ooooooooooooooooooooooon it makes a howl with its beautiful voice old mans fire gets eliminated by the howl which shook the whole area around here seriously it can also eliminate an attack from a dragon king with a sing le howl swish fenrir disappears for a moment zashuun a sound of something being torn apart and then guoooooooooo i heard old mans scream old mans body is being slashed old mans blood covers the battlefield it moved at godspeed and t hen ripped old man with its claws i was filled with frustration a legendary dragon my benefactor who trained me old man who is so strong and grand got cut down without doing anything i feel very frustrated i was told that the dragons are the strongest creatures i was told that dragons are more prideful than anyone the ash grey wolf in front of me destroys my beliefs so easily the old man bit and drank something which was hidden in his back tooth while
spurting out blood from his mouth the n the old mans wounds starts to disappear while making smoke immediately old man used the phoenixs tear just in case all the members have a possession of the phoenix tear the phoenixs tears were distributed from the devils for this battle i also to ok out a small bottle from my stomach and sprinkled the phoenixs tear on my wounds shuuuuu while making a smoke from my wounds the phoenixs tear starts to heal my wounds but that was certainly a dangerous situation that claw dug deeply into my b ody what attack power the hardness of boosted gear scalemail is nothing in front of that wolf thats why it must have easily destroyed valis armour as well it also tore out old mans body with it fenrirs fangs claws and everything else must be unr ivaled how can he pass through three legendary dragons without a wound this wolf is an insane monster me and vali who are the vanguards were given several phoenixs tears but from valis situation where he is still bitten by it it doesnt change t he fact that he is still being bitten even if he
uses the phoenixs tear so there would be no meaning to use it i need to release him from that state i wont be able to win against fenrir if i just go straight at him so fenrir has the same power as the true ddraig i cant use ddraigs power to the fullest so fighting against it properly would be hard if its juggernaut drive it may work but i will die i definitely will die in the worst case i have to do that i should be prepared just in ca se its definitely better than buchou asia and my comrades dying but at this rate we will just continue to waste phoenixs tears even so i have to help vali on the occasion i will have you fight against these ones as well the shadow under lokis foot expanded and from there a giant snakeno several dragons with long skinny bodies appeared im familiar with that appearance its size is reduced a lot but there is no doubt about it so you even mass produced midgardsormr oldman tannin sa id it with disgust yes hes exactly right they are identical to midgardsormr but they are about the
size of the old man and there are one two threefive of them in total goooooon the mass produced ones started to breathe out fire all at once you wont be able to take me down with something like this gobaaaaaaaan the mass produced midgardsormrs fire was wiped by old man tannins fire woah like i thought the fire from a real dragon is amazing rather than that the situation of this battle is getting worse but i realise right away that everyone is staying strong damn it will be our loss if we go to the defence charge bikou and buchous voice both the vali team and the gremory group are having fights to the death against the child fenrir raikou30 flash dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon barakiel san strikes down the raikou on the child fenrirs it has more than t en times the energy output of the ones akeno san uses but the child fenrirs seem unaffected even when they received damage and then resume their attack i think they received quite a lot of damage from the attack just now but the battle instinct they carry surpasses the ones we have dont take lightly my training with the sekiryuutei kiba
moves in godspeed to follow the child fenrir and then swings down his holy demonic sword the holy demonic swords slash its head and the child fenrir has blood sprouting from its forehead yes to be expected from kiba guwaa xenovia who tried to attack the child fenrir with that slight opening gets pushed back after being hit by it with its front paw blood comes out from her xenovia irina uses the phoen ixs tear she is carrying on xenovia at the same time she threw the spear of light it wont give remarkable damage but it seemed like it stalled it for a moment after being sprinkled with phoenix tears xenovias wounds heal immediately and she then m akes a stance with her two swords using durandal and ascalon gasper blind its eyes koneko you use that chance to punch it using the senjutsu anywhere on its body the boss buchou shouts gaspers body turns into several bats ey ey ey gasper who transformed into bats gathered at child fenrirs eyes and blinded it gasper nice support i will lower fenrirs ki as much as i can thanks to gasper child fenrirs eyes were sealed temporarily and koneko
chans punch hits she only hit it on its fo ot once but that would be okay the attack which was filled with senjutsu would pass through its body to give damage to its source of life though it might be far off from a critical hit but if its to help comrades then that hit would be enough xenov ia do it now receiving buchous order xenovia makes a stance with the two swords i still havent lost yet xenovias shout filled with high spirit echoes throughout the area dooooooooooooon the wave of enormous aura she demonstrated with her two swords against diodoras servants hits the childfenrir zabaaaaaaaaaaaaan child fenrir gets devoured by the wave created from the holy swords xenovias attack left two deep wounds but it doesnt go down yet so its even useless with that attack no we start from here zubababababan kiba created many holy demonic swords below child fenrirs foot and stalled its movements for a moment he then went slashing at it at that moment in godspeed he creates many wounds on child fenrirs body flash rum blerumble rumble akeno sans thunder also struck down my team members are stronger than fenrir yeah
on the other hand hows this then a bit away from me old man tannin breathed out his maximum output of fire at the mass produced midgardsormrs the battlefield turns into a sea of fire it seems like one of the mass produced midgardsormr is in pain inside the fire to be expected from the fireblaze that the former dragon king made that mass produced midgardsormr turns into ash inside the fire here is another one goooooooooon oldman took a big breath and then breathed out another enormous fire blaze towards a single mass produced midgardsormr which it blasted away it creates a huge crater on the ground while making a bomb blast but we cer tainly can depend on him amazing so a mass produced dragon king wont even put up a fight against the old man huh like i thought the old man is strong it was just that the parent fenrir was too strong i wont let you rosweisse san also activated a norse magic and is supporting old man tannin the magical bullets fell down on the enemy like raindrops and it pierces through the enemy oh that certainly gave damage to the midgardsormrs what an
amazing battle maiden heal and also for you asia who is the logistical support sends healing aura at times to those who have received damage the effect it has is great but since she is sending her aura continuously you can tell from her expression that she looks tired she is supporting everyone wh ile having the pressure of knowing that she might die in this battlefield so its waning her psychological state pretty badly but its certain that asias power of healing is becoming our source of life we can not cope in this battlefield with only the p hoenixs tears stay strong asia when you are in danger i will definitely rescue you the vali team who is taking on the other child fenrir are oppressing their enemy ora ora ora ora bikou started to strike the child fenrir repeatedly with his ruyi jingu bang get bigger ruyi jingu bang don wow bikou swung down his staff which has gotten bigger and sharply smacked the child fenrirs head nyahahaha i will seal your movements then kuroka used some kind of jutsu31 to change the ground under child fenrirs foot into mud having his foot trapped and movement sealed
there was someone who came slashing at th e child fenrir with a holysword which is emitting an enormous amount of aura arthur the holy king sword wielder to begin with i will take one of your eyes slash he used the holy king sword to graze deeply into child fenrirs left eye your claws are next he then started to cut of its front paws claws along with its flesh uwaaaa that swordsman sure is attacking very violently its even scarier because hes putting on a calm face and now for those dangerous fangs if its this holy king sw ord collbrande it should be able to wipe a mere child fenrir along with the dimension the holy king sword erased the child fenrirs fangs while making the air vibrate gyaooooooooon the child fenrir starts to shout with pain after having its eye claws and fangs taken away strong so these are valis comrades huh even if their opponent was just a child of fenrir their power is abnormal and they took it out with only three of them without having a hard time most of all what was amazing is that not even one of them are worried
that their leader vali was taken down and are continuing with their task that is something we can never do hyoudou issei valis voice vali who was still within fenrirs mouth spoke to me just looking at him seems painful loki and the other onesi will leave them to you bikou and others i didnt know what vali was trying to say this parent fenrir i will definitely kill it hearing that loki laughs fuhahahahahahaha how would you do that you are already on the verge of death wont acting strong just lower the name of hakuryuukou instead heavenly dragon no dont look down on i vali lucifer chills after vali gave loki a chilling glare he quietly began to chant at the same tim e a very bright aura is emitted from vali each jewel on his armour gave off a rainbow coloured glow flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaash i who is about to awake they are going to be blasted away they certainly are going to be blasted away voices that do not belong to vali echo in the area it must be the remaining thoughts of the past hakuryuukou which are sleeping within so it gives out a curse like voice
like this i realise it when i see it for myself maybe what i am trying to convince is act ually an embodiment of the abyss am the heavenly dragon who had the principles of domination stolen from everything the dream will end the illusion will begin i envy the infinite and i consider the dream everything yes give us everything i will master the path of domination of the white dragon and i shall lure you to the utmost purity juggernaut drive the whole abandoned mining ground was shining with a bright light a huge output of light is flowing out from fenrirs mouth and it started to swallow fenrir as well woooooooooooooow i can feel an overwhelming power which i cant even calculate its so amazing that it paralysed my senses so this is kuroka transfer me and fenrir t o the allocated place vali who is glowing with light commands that to kuroka kuroka also smiles hearing that and directs her hand at vali then starts to move her fingers in the air if i look carefully valis armour started to change is it an effect from using juggernaut drive so the armour starts to change like
that huh ah the magical chain meant for capturing fenrir also got transferred to valis place kuroka must have done that if the chain is used well then the current vali should be abl e to finish it off duuuuuuuun vali who has turned into a giant mass of light and fenrir get wrapped by many sashes which look like theyre made from demonic power vali and fenrir start to synchronise with the scenery of the night and then disappeared from the area vali even if i shouted his name i didnt get any reply juggernaut drive its my first time seeing it but i realised it right away that bastard vali activated his juggernaut drive that guy is he planning to take fenrir to somewher e far by force and whats with this allocated place like i thought maybe hes planning to do something bad no he must be planning to settle this somewhere very far away he must have picked that certain place beforehand i was told from sensei that vali is able to use his demonic power in replacement for his lifespan so as to use juggernaut drive for a short time but i was also told
that he cant use it perfectly most likely there is a thin line from going berserk and it might be dangerous as it would reduce his lifespan then i heard a shout akeno buchous scream when i looked i witnessed akeno san who is about to be bitten by the child fenrir i wont let you i wont let akeno san be killed my onee sama that i like very much shes my important senior i looked at loki once and then ignited the fire at maximum output for the thrusters on my back i also expanded my dragon wings and accelerated forward jet the voice on the jewel also echoes while i try to shorten the distance but i wont make it in time no i will make sure i do make it you are full of openings loki tries to shoot his magic from behind me goooooon but from high up in the sky a fire ball and magical light comes down at loki i wont let you hes right oldman tannin and rossweisse san backed me up thank you old man and valkyrie sister when i looked there was only one mass produced midgardsormr left oldman and
rossweisse san are in high spirits they basically annihilated the mass produced midgar dsormr with only the two of them i didnt have the time to be shocked because right now one of the worst incidents was about to happen right in front of my eyes crap it was the moment where child fenrirs fangs are about to tear into akeno san zashu a bitter noise of the fang tearing a piece of flesh was made the one who was pierced through with child fenrirs fang was barakiel san barakiel san gets his back pierced with child fenrirs fangs while protecting akeno san gough blood a large qua ntity of blood came out his mouth a lot of blood comes out from his wound why i cant afford to lose you as well akeno san has an expression where she cant tell whats going on right now ora don i hit child fenrir with a punch from its s ide barakiel san gets released along with that and he steps back asia i call for asia who is nearby asia creates a light green aura in the spot and she sent the aura towards barakiel san being enveloped with the
light green aura barakiel sans wounds starts to heal slowly his bleeding should stop but it will be hard for him to come back to the fight immediately he should have lost about the same amount of stamina as how much blood he just lost quite a lot of blood spilt when the fangs wer e removed from his body ii akeno san is panicking a lot get a hold of yourself akeno the battle hasnt ended yet barakiel san says akeno san please dont cry its okay i will protect you but there is something i want to confirm does akeno san really hate her father i just want to know that i used pailingual on akeno sans breast quietly with this akeno sans breast should reveal her secret to only me hey akeno sans oppai tell me does akeno san really hold a grudge agains t barakiel san akeno sans breast wont answer me dont tell me that it didnt work or is she in such a really shocked state that her breast wont tell me what she is thinking then her oppai quietly started to talk im not himejima akenos op pai i am the seirei of
oppai eh who the heck are you i point at akeno sans breast and let out a shocked voice akeno san and barakiel sans body shakes violently because of my sudden shout please calm down i am using th is girls oppai as the medium to talk to you akeno sans breast started to say something even weirder eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh what is this what is this exactly more than that who are you i am the seirei which serves chichigami sama the god who rules all oppai your obstinate craving towards oppai has summoned me impossible so my pailingual connected to a different channel that is absurd can something so crazy happen oold man oldman tannin is in the middle of fighting loki i thought i should ask the former dragon king at a time like this what did something happen again is it another breast during his battle he gives some time to look at my direction after hearing my panicked voice which mythology does the go dchichigami sama come from it seems like the old man cant close jaws at my question i dont know why but when i looked around both enemy and ally stopped their battle and
looked at me after a pause old man shouts towards buchou rias ojouu uuuuuu can you heal that guys heaaaaaad its criticaaaaaal no you are wrong old man im normal im normal i tell ya ise get a hold of yourself its an auditory hallucination aaah how can this be fenrirs poisonous fang has reached the seki ryuuteis mind buchou also has a misunderstanding that my brain took damage more than that i havent been affected by fenrirs poisonous fang sparkle i received a healing light from asia to my head thank you asia no thats not the problem you ar e mistaken akeno sans oppai definitely said that its an oppai seirei i try to explain it to them but this time barakiel san says it to me while his voice is shaking you you are telling me that my daughter is something which is so absurd damn you oppai dragon hes snapped and there are raikou running through his boddddddy sparkle again i received a healing light to my head thank you asia no thats not the problem nno everyone listen to me i certainly can hear the voice of th e socalled oppai seirei as well i

you calling chichiryuutei shit how come you also know that name listen to the real thoughts of this miko32 and summon the power of chichigami sama here i dont get it exactly but is that something amazing chichigami sama is very merciful and gives divine protection to those who seek oppai i dont get it it absolutely doesnt make any sense b but its true that i want to know akeno sans true feelings tthen seirei san can you make it that only me akeno san and barakiel san know her true feelin gs then very well then listen to this girls true feelings when i closed my eyes a certain scene is shown within my mind i hear the voice of a little girl who is singing where are you you higo where is higo in the garden of a small one storey house there was a girl playing maritsuki33 akeno where are you a woman who looks like akeno san called for the little girl akeno san kaasama akeno san was called by the woman her mother and she rushes in to hug her she has silky black hair and seems like a kind mother shes beautiful yet
it feels like shes going to disappear kaasama when will tou sama34 be back today ara akeno will you be going somewhere with your tou sama akeno san shows a very happy smile to her mothers question if he comes home early we will go shopping together by bus i was lonely that just nowwas akeno sans voice the scene changed this time barakiel san and the little akeno san were inside the bath i dont hate tou samas wings they are black but silky and are the same as akenos35 i see thank you akeno it would have been good if tou sama was always with me at the houses veranda the little akeno san is having her hair braided hey kaa sama does tou sama like akeno yes of course he does her mother smiles while braiding her hair gently i could only see tou sama sometimes and the scene changed dramatica lly inside a worn out room the tansu36 is pushed down on the floor and there is a huge hole on the tatami floor the table is turned upside down and the dinner food is all over the ground everything in the room is in a
mess i will have you hand that child over she is the child of the hated and evil black angel several people who seem to be jutsusha37 are surrounding akeno san and her mother i wont hand over this child this child is my precious daughter and also an important and precious daughter of that person never i wil l absolutely not hand her over akeno sans mother shouts as if she is protecting akeno san it seems like you also have been defiled by the black angel it cant be helped then the jutsusha drew out a katana and went to slash her down kaasamaa aaaaaaaaaaa what appeared next was barakiel san covered in blood he killed all of the jutsusha and his body was soaked in blood kaasama noooooo kaa samaaaa akeno san wasshaking the body of her mother who had already passed away and was cryin g out shuri barakiel san tries to touch his wife with his trembling hands dont touch her the little akeno san clashed her anger against her father why why didnt you stay with kaa sama we always waited for tou sama if tou sama was here then kaa sama wouldnt have
died those people said this that tou sama is a black angel and that you are evil they said that black angels are bad people they said that im a bad child because i also have black wings if tou sama and i didnt have black wings then kaa sama wouldnt have died i hate it i hate it i hate these black wings i hate you i hate everyone i hate them i knew that it wasnt tou samas fault but if i didnt think of it like that then my mind wouldnt last thats because imweak i was lonelyand i just wanted to live with only the three of us i then heard akeno sans mothers voice within my mind akeno that was a very gentle voice what ever happens please believe in your tou sama your tou sama might have hurt many people until now but you know this might be a hallucination but my eyes can clearly see it that akeno sans mother is gently embracing akeno san and barakiel san its true that he loves akeno and me thats why akeno pl ease love him too when i regained my consciousness akeno san who is
beside me was having tears flowing out kaa sama i i wanted to see tou sama more often i wanted tou sama to pat my head more i wanted to play much more with tou sama tou sama tou sama and kaa sama i wanted to live together with the three of us those are the true feelings of akeno san which were hidden inside her that scene from before was only shown to me akeno and barakiel san barakiel san who is laying down sa ys it after hearing akeno sans confession shuriand you there wasnt a single day that i forgot about you two he reaches for akeno san with his shaking hand akeno san takes his hand tou sama then it happened spaaaaaaarkle every jewel on my boosted gear scalemail glowed and then the mjlnir starts to emit intense light i can feel something very strong what is this chichiryuutei can you hear me chichiryuutei i then heard seireis voice from akeno sans oppai you saved this gi rls feelings and this girls oppai now is the time i give you the divine protection from chichigami sama gooooooon aura burst out from every part of my armour
oppai dragon listen well the power given from chichigami sama can only be used once in any case if they are giving me power then there is nothing more i can ask for the pulse i can feel from mjlnir isnt normal i can feel something which greatly surpasses the power of me and vali i can sense the pulse of a god class power that i am not familiar with chichigamifrom another world the sekiryuutei of this era is certainly full of mysteries loki says that and lifts his robe and he once again expanded his shadow from thereanother group of midgardsormr came out there are still some left this time again there are five of them it really is a fierce battle there is no end to this i never thought it would be this hard to fight a single god and his subordinates consecutive appearances of child fenrir and mass produced midgards ormr phoenixs tears and asias healing wont last at this rate then it happened i was bewildered but a black colour appears in front of me buooooooooooooooon a black like fire thing appears from the ground it twists and it covers up loki the two
c hildfenrirs and the mass produced midgardsormrs w what is it this time is it a shirigami38 this abyss black aura is is it the prison dragon vritra oldman tannin shouts like that vritra its saji if you think about it it certainly resembles sajis aura but that guy didnt have any kind of fire a giant magic circle which appears on the ground from the centre of it a b lackflame shapes into a dragon hyoudou issei kun can you hear me i am the vice governor of grigori shamhaza i heard an unfamiliar voice from the microphone i have on my ear for emergency oh hes the person who is from the same place as azazel sensei ah hello the one who sent that big black dragon was you shamhaza san yes i was told by azazel that i have to send saji kun to that location after saji kuns training was completed so that really is saji oh man hes like a fire dragon hes pitch black it seems like a black fire is in the shape of a dragon so thats vritra yes it seemed like azazel made a bit of a miscalculation we started his
training but he ended up in a state like that the time was up so we sent him in that state well it seems like he can tell apart from an ally and a foe and you gave that as an okay hmm fallen angels are quite daring what did you do we put every vritra type sacred gear on him you guys did something so reckless like that i just made a forced smile and the vice governor san continues when vritra was exterminated and then sealed into the sacred gear he had his soul split into many layers because of that there are many vritra type sacred gear possessors but if you were to g roup them there are four types of absorption line blaze black flare delete field and shadow prison these sacred gears were hidden within each possessor and had some differences and our organisation grigori retrieved them and put the vritra type sacred gears that we kept into saji kun being in contact with you resulted in vritras consciousness to slowly appear so azazel predicted that all of the vritra type sacred gears might be able to become one i see thats why sensei took
saji with him as a result the sacred gears combined and vritras consciousness was revived but it seems like it became berserk because it only revived just now but it seems like saji kuns consciousness is still in there so he should respond if you talk to hi m through ddraig so i leave the rest to you will you be able to do it yes i will somehow try to pull it off if something was to happen i will stop saji by force saji vritras black fire covers over loki two child fenrirs and mass produced midgardsormrs and was sealing their movements the flame moves as if it had its own mind and it seems like a snake was wrapping around them ku what is this fire i cant move ngggh my powers are being taken away gradually i is this the power o f that black dragon i have heard that there is a dragon king but dont tell me this is it it seems like loki is also in panic child fenrirs and mass produced midgardsormr are going crazy inside the fire but it seems like they wont be able to escape vritra had more special
abilities rather than direct attacks his power might be weak among the dragon kings but in terms of diversity and variety of techniques he is the best among the dragon kings thats amazing umm vice governor if there ar e other vritra type sacred gears cant you mass produce them with the same method that would most likely have zero possibility to begin with adding sacred gears is a dangerous action and you can die if it goes wrong but for this case since you and sajikun are friends and since you two understand each other vritras soul was able to revive with a miracle but it will be hard for the same phenomenon to occur in the same way by the way even if a new power is added the evil piece sleeping inside him wont change the basic base is absorption line after all the stats of his base body wont change that much as well so saji has a limitation huh vritra power he sure did attain such a troublesome power putting that aside saji kun wont be ab le to maintain that power for long defeat the enemies while they are sealed roger yeah then lets
settle this i took mjlnir in my hand and changed it into a giant hammer its light i see they did say that this was originally meant to be as lig ht as a feather so this is what they mean buchou bikou child fenrir cant move because of that fire lets finish them off at once to my words both of themno everyone agreed and they started to resume their attack on child fenrirs and mass produ ced midgardsormr i will defeat all of odin samas enemies rosswiesse san activates a variety of magic circles all around her body and released a magical attack doooooooon it hit the child fenrirs and mass produced midgardsormr who can not move and ga ve them intense damage i see because of sajis power their powers are being drained and are slowly becoming weaker saji can you hear me using the sacred gear i tried to contact saji who has become a black fire dragon uu oh i got a res ponse saji its me ise hyohyoudou whats happening to me right now i dont know why but my body feels so hot that it might burn out get a hold of your
consciousness you came in with a cool entrance so fulfill your role till the end and then go down what should i do what can you see you look around inside a black fire i can see giant wolves and long skinny big dragons continue to restrain them like that i think it would be okay if you think like that anyway think strongly also can you see a humanoid enemy found him i can sense a mysterious magical power coming from him and hes trying to get rid of the fire with it that guy is the boss dont let him erase it think strongly and ke ep restraining him i will do the rest i will settle this i gripped the hammer tightly sparkle sparkle this time a thunder is running through it i wont miss i will strike it down with everything i got jet i ignited the thruster on my back wit h maximum output and i also expanded my dragon wings widely and charged forward there is only one target evil god loki loki shoots out a magical attack from his hand i wont be able to dodge it now i want to use the
hammer as a shield but if this p ower disappears there will be nothing left bashuuuuuun i took lokis attack from the front it hurts with that my armour broke greatly the attack even reaches my body under the armour i felt an intense pain to my chest stomach hip and legs bashu uun this time one of them hits my helm the helm also gets destroyed and my head gets exposed well i wont stop only because i have a better view i can also tell my head is bleeding i dont have the time to materialize new armour nor to heal my wou nds i will charge forward like this booon loki broke through sajis barrier of fire shit he is a god even if he is rotten you think you can continue to grasp hold of this loki with something like this loki flies high up in the sky hes trying to run away stop right there loki laughs at me who is calling for him to stop sekiryuutei huh but its futile i will retreat for now fuhahahahaha however i will appear for the third time and bring chaos pigagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagag agagaga the raikou flashed and an
especially big one covers loki when i turned aroundakeno san and barakiel san are holding hands both of them have black fallen angel wings growing out haha amazing a raikou attack of a father and daughter wwhat did you do loki falls down while having smoke come from him it doesnt seem like he has big damage but it succeeded in stopping his movements goooooooooon a black fire covers loki once again saji good timing impossible its a fire barrier which i have unsealed once already loki becomes shocked but saji has a willpower that is about the same as me so he wont give up that easily do it hyoudou yeah leave it to me saji i grasped hold of my target and aimed at him i then lifte d up the hammer immediately oryaaaaaaaaaaaaaa my style mjlniiiiiiiiiir don the head of the giant hammer completely hits down lokis whole body noooooooooooow lets do it ddraig yeah boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostbo ostboostboost transfer i transferred the power which i increased to the maximum to the mjlnir then an unbelievable amount of thunder is created from the hammer dogagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagaga a super special strike devours l oki lokis bodyhas many tendrils of smoke coming
out from it his body is already crumbled loki who is all worn out falls on the ground the reason why the god recorded in the bible left a phenomenon called balance breakerand a weapon called lon ginus which can kill a god without getting rid of them did he know something like this could have happened why did he leave humans a method to kill a god after saying that it seems like he lost consciousness completely about the same time the childfenrir and mass produced midgardsormr were defeated chichiryuutei it was splendid im looking forward to meeting you again ah the voice of breast seirei is getting further away it finished its role then no what on earth was its role to beg in with iim really starting to get affiliated with unknown things i wanted to grow stronger in my own way but i already have similar things like this happening to me so spare me of it i cant take it anymore i said that strongly within myself to the god of breasts who is apparently a god from another world part 3 yo saji i woke up my friend who was unconscious at the centre
of the battle field he reverted back to his original appearance from the black dragon state naais that you hyoudou what happened to the battle he has regained his consciousness but it seems like his body cant move i called asia and urged her to heal him saji halfway got up and then i said it to him it has ended many things have happened but it is o ur victory saji smiles at my answer i see i wasnt very focused as i was barely conscious at the time but i heard your voice i was happy while i was suffering from my body which was getting burned your voice came to me it gave me lots of mora l support hahahaha you can depend on me but it will be hard if you were to go on a rampage like that are you serious was i going crazy yeah very much but thanks to that we won you were an amazing support hearing that it seems like saji is relieved then i dont care but saji looks around the aftermath of the battlefield the place is in ruins there are several craters on the ground and it wasnt
the same as before it really looks like a place after a war other members were in joy because of our victory xenovia and irina are exhausted and sitting on the ground valis team members are nowhere to be seen they had evacuated before we even realised it they sure are good at disappearing without a trace vali also didnt return after that did he win i dont think he is dead loki had his power sealed by rossweisse san who used many types of norse magic seals on him after he was captured the hammer called mjlnir had amazing power even though it is just a replica well it was als o due to my multiplied powers as well but i was able to defeat a god with it youve been fighting in battles like this numerous times right things like god maou and two heavenly dragons and such saji says it as if he admires me well so many thi ngs happen in our group people say that maybe the power of the sekiryuutei is calling them but i almost died many times geez thinking about it i have been going through things like this since i became
a devil arent i fighting against legendary bein gs a lot i wont survive even if i have lots of lives at this point that is the reason why you are amazing i was really scared before doing the training such that i was trembling i really wanted to go home but if i ran away i wouldnt be able to fa ce kaichou and the others im in a similar situation as well im scared that i cant continue but i have to do it it seems like my road to becoming a harem king is rough so i have to break every single obstacle on my way for that i will have to adapt to the power of the sekiryuutei and other kinds of power and make them my own there are many things i want to make a reality and many things i want to protect i have to walk right ahead no matter what im no match for you even though you ar e a sukebe39 healed asia smiles it seems like saji is healed asia can you tend to other peoples wounds as well you can leave me for l ast yes i understand but
please dont push yourself and rest at my words asia goes towards her comrades ise buchous voice was calling me buchou was looking at the direction where akeno san is ah akeno san is trying to make barakiel san st and up his wounds are healed with asias power but i think he has used up other factors he did spill all that blood before akeno san wont be able to support a man with such a good build by herself somehow i knew what buchou is trying to tell me i understand buchou i approached akeno san and barakiel san i put barakiel sans arm around my shoulder without a word chichino hyoudou issei barakiel san looks shocked apparently he didnt expect me to help him you tried to call me chichir yuutei just now didnt you well i dont mind i dont eat breasts i said it while smiling yyes you are right he seems like hes embarrassed so barakiel san even put on a face like this huh mmy daughter do you like akeno yes i like he r very much i think she is a reliable and kind lady i replied like that immediately is it
me or does barakiel san look happy after hearing that akeno san who was also supporting barakiel san has a very red face wellahahahaeven i would become shy if you react like that i see barakiel san seems satisfied then we sent him to his comrades waiting somewhere else as a rear support by the magic circle okay then hyoudou issei you can still move right we have to fix the aftermath of this bat tlefield we will be restoring these grounds having been urged by old man tannin i was also forced to help him after this i was made to do work to fix the hole vali created so i worked till morning shit vali you idiooooooooot where did you go surveillant so thats the sekiryuutei and hakuryuukou huh we have also confirmed the vritra and the holy demonic sword vritra is in a burst state but its heading towards a new path the holy demonic sword is an irregular thing just like the info rmation we have says it was right for us to come and observe them it seems like the technology teams theory will be able to gain positive proof that the percentage of sacred
gear possessors who get involved with the sekiryuutei and hakuryuukou even once will have an irregular awakening at a different level grigoris technology is also a threat so have you found a way to defeat the juggernaut drive i think we can stand up to them using a sacred gear which increases its consumption rate we d ont have demonic powers and if it consumes their lifespan we can aim for that then the problem is the sekiryuutei it seems like it is trying to grow in a weird way maybe hes trying to go deep within the consciousness of the longinus hakuryuukou is al so a problem in that regards i got a call from cao cao just now hmm oh my this is what happened is it perhaps yeah the dragon eater was found with this the infinite will end vali lucifer the juggernaut drive which i havent used for a while burned me as it was very dangerous if i can i want to reduce the number of times i have to use it otherwise i wont last at this rate so what happened on your side arthur it seems like i can do something about it
by using the power of this excalibur which controls ruling to fenrir that is it has restrictions so fenrirs power will decrease quite a lot but even if you had your eyes on its fangs you sure have weird taste for taking in such a dangerous monste r to our team vali we received a call from cao cao bikou what did he say to make it short we will act on our own just dont get in our way thats what he said cao cao lets hope that nothing happens to both of us though we wont hold ba ck if you were to come at us but i never thought he would get the support of a god from a different world hyoudou issei he sure is someone i cant predict and he sure does entertain me his growth rate is at full speed in a totally different directio n fufu oppai dragon huh hes like an existence which is a joke but it seems he is becoming something which will not be a joke boss x boss im sorry i can only say it to you by communicating this way but it seems like my family was
saved by you again azazel yeah but you know sirzechs this was also a tough one but it seems like the oppai dragon saved the day again man he is filled with mysterious powers that guy ise what on earth is a chichigami so is it okay not to tell ise about that the one where there is a talk about his promotion right the discussion about that is rising for ise kiba and akeno right yes kokabiels attack the terrorist attack during the three great powers negotiation meeting the terror that occurred at the party sponsored by us and the terror by the old maou faction rias and her group prevented all of them theres enough of achievements for a promotion and also preventing lokis attack is a big achievement you can say tha t the promotion for the three of them is guaranteed well their achievements are top rank among the devils who have been living in peace for a while especially ise who is a sekiryuutei and also a popular guy in the underworld akeno is barakiels daug hter kiba has the irregular holy demonic sword they are all excellent and promising devils in terms of power
they already have that of high class devils but yes thats right its too early regarding ise kun he has only been a devil for about h alf a year if he receives a promotion he will become talked about and he will become the target of the enemy in terms of gaining more strength another five yearsno i want him to wait at least another three years but the public opinion and the craz e of the underworld are pushing forward for their promotion hahahaha looks like the maou is going through a rough time so what is your personal feeling to this then i would want him to get a promotion he would bear a certain title so he can carr y on the house together with my sister and her servants the old devils are stubborn about those kind of things but not only is he young but it is also a bit too early i still want ise kun to remain as an oppai dragon for a while longer well you a re right about that its probably necessary to look over him for a bit longer but i think that will be very short you
know yeah i know that ise he will be trying to make more achievements so he can go on the railway to become a harem king but e ven if he does get a promotion yes what he will do from there now that is the place where the real thing of being a devil starts also its about the hero faction did you find something the sacred gear possessors who were captured alive and have been under my investigationhad an unnatural death all of them yeah the cause of it was ophiss snakes so they drank it like we thought no thats not it the possessors themselves didnt drink it its a new type of snake which you wrap around the sacred gears it seems like it stimulates the sacred gears strongly using those new snakes most likely instead of the possessors it forcefully drags out the hidden potential power of the sacred gear instead of its attack power it was eq uipped to stimulate the unknown factors of the balance breaker which still has many hidden factors about it its the most delicate and dangerous way of doing it if it goes wrong the sacred gears will break
they keep on repeating such forceful experiment s i checked the remaining left overs of the snakes but it is made to stop working if either the possessor dies or if the possessor reaches balance breaker something like increasing the number of those who can use balance breaker including us it is a f eat we can not copy right now even if we want to so those are the methods to increase the number of those who can use balance breaker huh if the sacred gear goes into a burst mode and breaks then the possessor will die either way it is a method which they dont mind because the possessors would die if they cant reach balance breaker bargain sales of balance breakers are scary but the thing we have to be the most cautious about is the birth of a new longinus it seems like it will become messy counter measures against sacred gears if i think about it the enemy which will cause the biggest nuisance are sacred gears with variant types of special abilities if it is a simple power type then it will be easy to solve the problem but its a pain since
there are many abilities which can seal off and kill power types sacred gears are interesting but they are scary because of it the parting gift left by god something which had been supporting us from the shadow till now and which was o nly something with a special ability to come and become an obstacle to us new life ah the school trip is coming soon i get lazy in the occult research club room and i am looking forward to the upcoming school trip geezer finished his conference safely and returned to his homeland it seems like he got some good response i returned that hammer back to the geezer vali he disappeared while taking one of the fenrir with him its actually a big problem but since we caugh t loki the whereabouts of fenrir would be known soon and the countermeasures against it will be made as well but that bastard had been aiming for fenrir the whole time its our fault for not realising it but i cant forgive him for using us that guy what is he planning to do with fenrir like i thought i will never come to terms with that guy
sensei isnt here today he said he will send off barakiel san who finished his role we thought we could send him off as well but he said it will be enough with just me isesan we have been busy lately so we have to go shopping for the school trip next time asia says that while looking at the guidebook for the school trip asia i hear that we have to wear underwear which is popular right now xenovi a says that asia makes a red face hearing that rreally yup it seems like when we go inside the bath where we will be bathing with everyone else others will laugh at us if we dont wear proper underwear i also dont have cute looking underwear maybe it would be better for us to shop together scschool trips are very deep hmm this must be kiryuus doing well for girls the pros and cons about the pants they are wearing is a thing they have to check the society of girls sure must be tough white is the best i think that is the actual underwear that the lord and michael sama would say yes for irina enters the
room with a lot of enthusiasm no i will be wearing victory pants together with asia eh m me too no no the colour fo r faith is white or the ones with an emblem of a cross the church trio are arguing about their underwear what are you girls doing it sure is peaceful i cant believe we had that many battles i then had a thought the stronger we get the more i re alise that there are many strong foes in this world and somehow they usually appear in front of us its not like i want to become the strongest in this world or anything but i do want to become the ultimate pawn though if they were to attack us then i think we need strength to fend them off its the basics for the group to work together and fight but i also have to become stronger by myself as well i want to pursue a lot more about the possibility of the sekiryuutei which sensei has predicted s o i will continue to convince the thoughts of my past senpais which are still remaining within the sacred gear hmm maybe i should develop
a new technique next time after i discuss it with sensei i should try it out with having kiba and saji participat e in my training im doomed when i looked the silver haired woman rossweisse san was crying uuuuuuuuu horrible odin sama is so horrible to leave me behind yup just like that she was left behind by odin the geezer probably by now the geezer should have realised that rossweisse san isnt with him but if he hasnt contacted us then that means fired this must mean that im fired doesnt it i worked so hard for odin sama and he left me in japan just like he says i cant do my j ob properly im a virgin im a woman where my age equals the number of years i havent had a boyfriend she has already lost herself mou dont cry rossweisse i made sure that you could work in this academy buchou rests her hand on rossweisse sans shoulder sob r really yes just like you wished for you want to be a teacher correct and not a student of course despite my appearance i have already graduated from school in my homeland by skipping
grades even though im still young in age i am qualified to teach students seriously she doesnt appear to be older than us at all but she chose to become a teacher but will i able to live in this country but if i returned home others would get mad and say you must be brave to s how your face when you returned after odin samas arrival and i probably would have my position removed uuuand i was finally able to find a job where i could have a stable life shes quite depressed certainly she would look like a complete idiot if the chief god who she was supposed to be escorting arrives home before his bodyguard ufufu so thats where this plan would come in buchou got closer to her and took out a document of some sort and showed it to her if you come to the underworld now you can get privileges like this and privileges like that rossweisse san made a shocked face after looking through the documents really there is this much insurance and there are tax refunds thats exactly it also dont you think that a s ervice like this and a
system like this is wonderful too its amazing so ddevils get paid this much the base salary is totally different from ours even if you compare them to valhalla these have better requirements shes bribing a battle maide n bbuchoushe really seems like an insurance woman now so this is what you call a whisper from a devil devils do make contracts with humans with greed as their job after all this is the way of a high class devil buchous expert way of convincing people i think she has a natural talent in doing this this is what you would call a devil by the way if you come under me then you will also get these benefits i heard that one family member of the gremory household promoted to a maou and that t he specialities made within the gremory territory are very popular and are receiving high sales for it thats true you can even do that job for your career the gremorys are looking for very talented people buchou who is continuing to bribe rossweis sesan takes out a crimsonchess piece from her pocket thats how it is so wont you become my servant so you
can start a business in the underworld i think you will be able to become a magic cannon member by attaining the rook piece and with that magic of yours i just hope that it would be possible with just one chess piece everyone was shocked at buchous offer of course we would for buchou this is her last chess piece her last rook so she will be taking in the valkyrie who specialises in magic but we certainly want more casters there was no one else besides buchou and akeno san who are wizard types and specialise in magic and if someone like that becomes a rook we have a moving cannon which can do a full burst of magical attack i t seems like she has a variety of special moves and techniques so we wont have any loss more like we would gain more with this more than that she is a beauty and cute so that makes it the best though she is clumsy but she looks like a cool beauty i feel like this is destiny it might be my selfish imagination but ever since i met you all at the hospital in the underworld
it must have been decided that it will turn out like this rossweisse san accepted the crimson coloured evil piece then at that moment a bright crimson glow lights up the room and devil wings appeared from rossweisse sans back it was accomplished with only one rook piece since she is a battle maiden i thought she would require more maybe the compatibility between t he evil pieces and those from norse works in a different way it was recently announced that the unused evil pieces change to reflect the growth rate of the master who possesses them the maou ajuka beelzebub who was part of creating them is famous fo r including secret factors for the technical programmes kiba who is beside me gave me an explanation hmm so there are still unknown factors within them huh also the world of devils is amazing for allowing such factors maybe they welcome irregular thi ngs if i remember the game gets heated up when the viewer watches a battle different from the normal ones the silver haired former valkyrie rossweisse san bows down at us everyone i have reincarnated into a devil im rossweisse a former valkyrie it seems like
the annual salary of the underworld and their insurances are more appealing than the ones of my homeland i have lots of security now since the financial state of the gremory household and my future will be very stable so i have become a dev il so please take good care of me from now her expression looks like she has been brainwashed and so everyone my rias gremorys last rook will be her rossweisse buchou introduces rossweisse san like that with a smile to be expected fr om a devil they are the ultimate beings in regards of controlling peoples greed well i think its fine even i joined in a mess xenovia says that casually while drinking green tea well indeed there was a similar situation with her as well lets get along everyone also welcomed rossweisse san with warm arms i also had no reason to decline and i was happy for a new beauty to join our group but just like that time with xenovia and this time with rossweisse san the pieces are used up quite easily ufufufufufufufufu odin sama the next time we meet i wont forgive you okay rossweisse san puts on a
creepy smile sscary shes covered in an intense aura the geezer has a grudge from her rossweisse san might be a bit crooked but with this our group is completed buchou akeno san kiba asia koneko chan xenovia gasper rossweisse san and me all 9 members are completed we have to think of a new formation when i was thinking such things akeno san gives me a bento box isekun these are leftovers but please accept it nikujaga40 i just picked it with my fingers and chucked it into my mouth the taste which has the r ight flavour spreads throughout my mouth delicious its delicious akeno san i dont know how to explain it but it gives me the feeling of being safe its a bit different from the ones in my house but it has a motherly taste to it i receive a h ashi41 from her and start digging into it thats because this tastes delicious i was eating and akeno san smiles happily beside me im gla d that ise kun is enjoying it oh your lips hmm do i have something on my face i tried to take it off with my hand but akeno
sans face approached and chuu for a moment akeno sans lips lightly touched my lips they didnt touch each other properly but ththththat right now was ufufu that would make it my first kiss i guess akeno san smiles while having her cheeks red kkkisssssss would that count as a kiss its not a hard kiss but right now our lips the other girls sa w that and they concentrated their murderous glare at me ise isesan senpai yeah care to explain to us buchou and asia close in with a smile and koneko chan and xenovia close in with scary faces why is this happening to meeee kiba ga sper help meeee since we are the male group who made an oath to each other in that training so they will definitely come to rescue me but kiba just smiles and shrugged his shoulder while gasper looks away and went into the box to hide what was our unification made from something so weak hug i was being cornered by buchou and others but akeno san hugs me from behind she seems to be really enjoying it she then says it so everyone can hear it ise i love
you ufufu hearing that buchou puts on an angry face and covers her body in a crimson aura mou ise akeno today i wont forgive you two and my daily life gets even noisier dad the trouble ended and i azazel was tagging along with barakiel who was planning to buy a few souvenirs in japan it seems like the other idiots asked barakiel to bring them stuff when he returns man those guys well it cant be helped since their governor which is me is like this when i was resting on a bench inside the department store barakiel returned carrying many bags with his hands hmm looks like i have everything they asked for good job barakiel sits next to me he seems exhausted for a stiff warrior type like him shopping must be hard but he still finishes eve rything to the end once he is asked to do something i then took out a bento box which was inside the bag that i was carrying barakiel here take it what is this wrapping just open it when he opened it there was a single bento box bento its something akeno gave me when i was on
my way here she gave it to me without saying anything but i knew who i had to give it to without asking her this is when he opened the bento box it had magnificent japanese food inside which is full with d ifferent colours barakiel looks at me i urged him to eat it without saying it and by making a smile he took the hashi42 and puts the food i nto his mouth timidly that momenta single tear drips down from barakiels eyes nikujaga43 it has the taste of shuri he started gulping them and was addicted to it he just kept on eating it while being silent he was eating it with enthusiasm while shedding many tears i then said it to my friend leave akeno to me rias and the others there isnt a problem the guy who she fell for is an idiot and is lecherous but he is a good guy barakiel stops his hashi and covers his eyes with his hand he then says it to me while his voice is mixed with a cry hei want to believe that he willtake care of akeno yeah its going to be okay he doesnt

17 to 18 even though she is young she chose to become a teacher instead of being a student so that will make it compulsory for her to go to the school trip this is the birth of rossweisse sensei after the incident from the last volume is e is in a lovey dovey relationship with asia this time akeno was the main girl so there wasnt many scenes of them being lovey dovey but they are being lovey dovey at home and school so please imagine it everyone behind the scene he is also getting clos er to buchou the baka uple45 between him and buchou has escalated hasnt it entering the new chapter ises growth rate has also entered the next phase this volume is the part where he stood in the beginning part of it will the curse of sekiryuutei be solved he needs to find the stronger form on his own different from the juggernaut drive please look over ise and his growth with warm eyes by reading the new chapter chichigami sama is like a bonus point thing which comes to him rarely so please dont take it that seriously now about other characters the
two heavenly dragons have entered their delicate periods ddraig and albion both started crying during the story this is all due to ises action though the pitiful dragons so please root for them they arent at fault the pitiful dragon number 3 old man tannin again he acted comically due to ise you can ask the former dragon king when you are in trouble and he will answer anything ises master sure is a dragon king who is a strong support saji had the soul of vritra resurrected due to his battle against ise he appeared at the end while covered in a black flame he still hasn t mastered using his power at all but what kind of ability was added to it he might grow in a different direction to ise lastly asia in the fight this volume it would had been a dangerous battle if asia wasnt present her healing ability is somethin g which is becoming very essential to the group and the group understands that so they fight while protecting asia with their life asia sure has grown now about khaos brigade the hero faction are plotting something creepy from behind the shadows what are
they planning to do with the sacred gears they are certainly trying to achieve something in a different way from the old maou faction from volume 8 they will get involved in the story even more vali and his team who act self accordingly they aren t allying with the hero faction but even though they teamed up with ise and others in this volume it doesnt change the fact that they are groups who need to be thought of cautiously the two heavenly dragons who have a unique relationship ise and he have started to acknowledge each other but how far will these two grow now the new chapter will give spot light to the sacred gears which were treated as a minor things till now i think their creepiness has been expressed in this volume the ability which was convenient how much of threat will it be when it turns on you now for the thanks volume 7 has been released safely miyama zero sama and the supervisor h sama thank you very much next story is the school trip ise will be in action with kyo to being the stage for it thats what you would think

the infirmary room unfortunately the nurse wasnt here so i went on to the bed until the nurse comes back apparently i took a nap for a bit and when i opened my eyes there is a boob which is white like sno w in front of me i was familiar with this oppai the only real oppai i ever saw belongs to one person beside my mums i looked up a bit to confirm the face of the person this oppai belongs to zzzzzzzz the one who was sleeping quietly was buchou who has long crimson hair she is my onee sama but why was buchou on the same bed as meand she was naked i mean your black wings are growing out buchou did she become defenceless be cause she was sleeping not long ago there was a time when buchou was inside the same bed as me before i wont explain about that now but it happened that time buchou was also naked and i have that image saved inside my head yeah its permanently s aved i sometimes use it to take out the youth inside me but i never expected that i would get to
sleep with her again this quick also it seems like shes sleeping while hugging my head i can feel the sensation of her oppai with my nose oppai a re amazing theyre soft shit my tears arent stopping there is a treasure right in front of me but i cant touch it can i only enjoy it with my nose while i was thinking like that it seems like buchou woke and she opened her eyes ara ise fu aaaa buchou made a yawn bubuchou ummwhat is thissituation i asked her a question while my heart was beating fast buchou answers while patting my head which she is hugging on to i felt a bit tired i was thinking of taking a nap in the infirmary and you were sleeping so i invited myself inside ininvite i wasnt sure what to say so thats how she explains it something like that happened while i was sleeping for a bit was i a nuisance no its the best no no that ummm i dont know how to put it a nuisance absolutely not im so deeply moved that my tears arent stopping buchou sama bubut sleeping naked is a bit too
much i cant sleep without being naked it also would be perfect if i have a pillow or doll that i can hug on to pipillow dodoll is that so so im a replacement for a doll no no that would be good enough buchou then looks into my face what is it buchou ise do you like girls breasts yes i love them i answered h er immediately that was obvious those were my true feelings this was the only thing i couldnt lie about im a high school student that lives by ero hearing that buchou made a naughty smile she brought her face near my ear i could smell something n ice from her crimson hair that scent stimulates my brain then she made a finishing blow do you want to touch my breast there is something mysterious running through my body after i heard something guys want to hear from girls i want to touch i t i want to grope it i want to suck it this is one of the dreams of every guy while my head was in paradise buchou says it to me then will you listen to my request yes what
is it i will do anything for touching your oppai onee sama i will fu lfill any request buchou then says it to me while my head was pink inside then try to get one contract part 2 we have arrived asia greets everyone with an energetic voice asia and i went straight to the club room after the lecture ended araara isekun asia chan you have come early would you like tea akeno san greets us with a smiling face your black silky hair is wonderful like always akeno san your oppai are massive like always as well yes please as soon as she heard my reply she starts to pour tea into a cup looks like everyone besides us were already here buchou is also drinking tea elegantly hey koneko chan i greeted the small girl sitting in the corner of the room hello fufufu if i could add the two girls with buc hou and asia you can create the ultimate bishoujo team the occult research club which is full of bishoujo its the best workplace there is i wouldnt be exaggerating if i said that i only came here to be with them aaah im so
glad i joined this club the oxygen here is fresh and it tastes really delicious hi there was a guy who raised his hand to greet me its kiba a good looking guy whose refreshing face pisses me off he is the enemy of all the guys in this school chi bloody good lookin g shit aaah yeah yeah i waved my hand roughly with my eyes half closed so everyone has gathered then lets start the discussion buchou says that after confirming we are all here the other members and i sat in the sofa surrounding the table the person sitting on the chief seat is our crimson haired buchou sama so the meeting of the occult research club began part 3 i will be going with ise as a supervisor when the meeting that continued till night became a discussion about me thats what b uchou said the activity of the occult research club the occult research clubs outer activity is researching about ghosts and magic related things but the actual activity is different we are devils by the time the sky gets dark thats when our real work begins the job of devils is to be summoned
by a summoning magic circle and to make contracts by fulfilling their wish we received a price the price can be money objects and sometimes life lately there arent many people who draw a magic circle to summon a devil so current devils draw a magic circle on leaflets and give them out to humans with strong desires so they can do their business going back to the discussion from the meeting it looks like the results from my work are bad i still have nt made a single contract yet i feel so ashamed no i am getting jobs thats not a problem but every time i go to the client weird things happen resulting in the contracts not being completed i am getting close with the people who summon me wel l devils are supposed to make contracts so theres no meaning if i cant fulfill their wish even if i get friendly with them buchou is also troubled with me and that resulted in her words just before for me to make trouble for buchou im such a usele ss guy and people who always summon me end up being hentais am i actually able to fulfill
my dream of becoming a harem king yeah thats right im going to keep on making contracts and receive a peerage from maou and when i become a high class devil im going to gather bishoujo and make my own harem for achieving that i am going through this harsh life but the reality is really harsh shit i want to have girls in both my arms and want to talk about polygamy no vulgar imagination allowed ouch koneko chan said that with narrow eyes seems like she saw through my imagination shes usually a quiet girl but the words she sometimes says shock my heart fufufu you had a lecherous smile snap something snapped in my head and i got pissed shuuuut up kibaaaaaa unlike you i can only be popular in my imagination i can only do erotic stuff in my head my imagination is mine only damn it i also wanted to be born as a handsome guy all the good looking guys should just disappear from this w orld every primate that can create a harem is my enemy i shouted my anger with teary eyes geez dont cry and a primate are you trying to
look at gorilla and chimpanzee as enemies too buchou made a sigh while patting my head sob if i was popul ar i would have been doing drumming like those guys in heavy metal why werent we evolved from a gorilla i started to say illogical things but buchous patting is the best aaaah getting treated like this from a bishoujo sama is the best the pain in my heart is disappearing flash then the big magic circle on the ground started to glow it was making the club room bright by releasing bluewhite light when this magic circle grows it means that someone is trying to summon a devil in other words we are being called by humans with desires we transport to the clients place by this magic circle and fulfill their wish this is how the devils job starts akeno san walks toward the magic circle while shaking her ponytail she raised her hand and is c hecking something after doing it for few seconds she looks at me and buchou with a smile buchou its a wish that even ise kun can fulfill buchou nods her head after hearing that i understand ise lets go buchou
grabs my hand and walks towards t he magic circle bubuchou are you seriously coming with me is she really going to supervise me i will be too embarrassed that i cant work like usual buchou puts her hand on my cheek and smiles you are my adorable servant so i will take care of you so follow me uuuyou are a cheater buchou i would want to get spoiled by you if you say that yes please take care of me my face became red isesan please do your best while getting cheers from asia buchou and i walked into the glowin g magic circle part 4 when the bright light stops we were in a room from the looks of it is it a room in an apartment when i looked around the room there were so many objects related to sengoku1 there was a sword in a sheath mounted on the wall there were lots of posters of japanese castles there was also a scroll that says fuurin kazan there was a helm of the bushou2 from the sengoku era on the shelf the room was dark but there were lights on lamps waah i was so
shocked that i let out my voice of course thats because t here is an armour of a bushou right in front of me man these are supposed to be expensive arent they it looks creepy because its in this dark room so whos the client who called me and buchou i looked at every direction but there isnt anyone umummmm gashan the bushous armour moved at the same time i heard a womans voice uwaaa i got shocked and screamed arare you two devils i can feel that im being looked at from behind the mask of the armour the pressure isnt normal but opposite of the pressure the voice sounded adorable she seriously is a girl yyes we are devils i nodded my head while hiding the fact that i was scared so i actually summoned a devil papardon me but are you a woman the armour nodde d at my question but im really shocked devils do exist shocked thats my line where in the world is there a girl who wears armour in her room my name is susan just like you can see my hobby is to collect things related to the sengoku era susan
shes a foreigner im getting even more shocked im sorry for dressing up like thisits dangerous at night so i protect myself like this by wearing this armour i probably shouldnt say that shes the dangerous one the first step o f learning another countrys culture is by being in contact with them its wonderful buchou nods her head while saying that no no thats kind of wrong but im glad that the ones who came out were kind looking devil san if it was a scary devil san i would have drawn out this katana kijin marukuni shige susan has a japanese sword in a sheath in her hand scary susan is really scary sso what was the reason you summoned us you called us because you wanted us to fulfill your wish right when i asked she started to cry sobsobplease come with me to the university i am attending to as an exchange student university at night is really scary i think youre the scary one but i couldnt say that gashan gashan its midnight and there is an armour walking in the street this is a bizarre view my town will turn into a horror town
buchou and i accepted her wish and we were guarding her while heading to the university she goes to to tell you the truth i dont think she need s any guardssusan is wearing a mushas armour and its midnight how come she seems more intense than us devils who are the residents of night damn it people who summon me are all weird we told her that it would be alright if only buchou and i go to the university to get her book but no no i cant let only devil san go i will go as well she said it while crying and she followed us ooooooooooooooon susan is crying maybe because shes scared of walking at n ight please dont cry with a low voice that sounds like a curse you have so much intensity that its scaring me its a waste to leave her as a human buchou says it while she was taking interest at the atmosphere susan is giving off susan theres a d evil looking at you susan is really a scaredy cat and she starts to swing her katana if she gets scared even a bit she was troubled because she
left an important notebook at school then she saw the leaflet to summon devils and she ended up summoning us we have already received a payment its not a big wish so we didnt mind doing it for free but she insisted she would pay a price the payment we got was a small scale japanese castle we can only keep it in the club room maybe akeno san would be happ y we have already sent it to the club room via the magic circle dont be scared im with you so walk with pride sobthank you buchou cheers susan on while she walks next to her buchou armour walking by itself is already scary but isnt it he avy while walking wearing that armour its my question you would need quite a lot of stamina to walk while wearing armour like that shes also a girl isnt it hard theres no problem even if i look like this i train while wearing this armour when im bored of course its training only inside my room the musha from long time ago ran around the battlefield wearing armour even i should be able to do that what are you
competing with you seriously are someone who is hard to understand susan oh it looks like its the end of the night walk with the musha i can see our destination the university ah this is the university i go to see it has a scary atmosphere doesnt it no you are the one with the scary atmosphere an armoured person ri ght in front of the university at night its really scary lets go inside aaaah its scary an armour that is going inside the university just thinking about it makes me shiver like this we finished our job we returned to susans room after s afely retrieving susans notebook buchou started to cast the magic circle for returning to the club room after confirming the job is completed okay we will be going back now i bid my farewell to susan with a smile fufufu i cant help myself from sm iling of course i accomplished my job safely the meaning of this is big yes i have fulfilled my promise with buchou by completing my job i can grope buchous oppai when i think that i can put my face in that rich and prosperous oppai the
sexual ur ges within me arent stopping aaah the excitement of youth within me is rising my eyes are already locked on at buchous breast and im not even letting it out of my sight for a second yeah first of all i will get her right oppai im going to grope i t while moving my hands clockwise i will also enjoy the left oppai by putting my hand on top of it and shake it umexcuse me susan talks to me shyly while i was thinking about erotic stuff on full throttle hm what it creeps the hell out of me if an armour is trembling it might be a bit rude if it isnt rude there is one more wish i want to be fulfilled wish she wants to make another contract huh i want to go back and grope buchous thats okay i was making a face because i didnt want to but buchou who is beside me agreed to it wait buchou we have to listen to this armour girls wish again while not noticing my teary eyes buchou turns off the magic circle to listen to susan sob buchous oppai is going further aw
ay buchou left me alone who was in shock and started to listen to susans wish susan then was trembling like a maiden and said to tell you the truth im thinking of going forward to someone who goes to the same university as me and tell him my feelings is that a challenge to that person eh going forward as in killing that person nno oh so it isnt she said going forward so i thought she wanted to start a battle or something ummummm there is a man that i like im slow at these things but i want to tell him my feelings i see so theres someone she likes i imagined a bushou from the sengoku era with massive beard the man who this armour girl must be in love with is someone like that he probably laughs like gahahaha buchou put a smile on hearing that and nodded its a wonderful wish okay i will listen to your wish you will im glad devil san are good people susan started to do a step dance after hearing buchou dont do step dance while wearing armour i ts scary so what are we supposed to do
do you want us to organise a showy play or do you want us to get this persons heart by using demonic power no no if its possible i want to go out with him by telling my feelings but its my first time a t things like this im not sure where to start from hmm she doesnt want to make the man she likes into her lover with the power of devils in other words she wants to make it happen with her own strength but she doesnt know how so she wants our help huh it would be the quickest if you confess you feelings directly susan shook her head violently at buchous suggestion its impossible for me then how about a letter buchou nods at my suggestion yes i think a love letter is also good i think its wonderful to show your feelings in a letter as well i understand i will write it susan went into a corner of the room and started to search for something she then took something out it was a calligraphy set she got a blank page for the calligraphy and put it down she then dipped the brush
in the ink by combining the room and susans appearance it looks like a horror film when shes writing an armoured person writing in ink it feels as if she has a strong grudge she looks like on e of those ghosts with a strong grudge who lives in a haunted house the armour that is shining under the candlelight is glowing strangely someone call a fricken ghost buster this room is cursed sususan isnt it better to use a normal pen and pape r what are you trying to write i asked her while a single drop of sweat dropped from my cheek eh this is the letter a love letter i wrote i send this letter for a purpose of thee in the meaning of peace hold on a second what language is that i asked her because she wrote some unknown sentence from the beginning of the letter its japanese it means that please be rest assured because its nothing special no no dont bend your neck like you dont know what i mean thats not it no matter how you look at it people of the current generation wont understand what you wrote and no one
uses ink now what is this the sengoku era does the letter have to be like the sengoku era as well its also weird to say that its nothing specia l when its supposed to be a love letter it doesnt seem like you are trying i mean if you dont express your love then thats just a cursed letter susan drops down on the floor she seems shocked at hearing what i said nno i cant write a lett er besides this eh you came to japan as an exchange student so learn how to write normal japanese no even english is fine since you are an exchange student even that person will try to translate it because he would want to know what is written then there was no meaning for me to come to japan japanese men are the descendants of samurai i want to go out with a samurai san in order to have a proper relationship this person is useless i need to do something quickly shes one of those foreign ers who have a total misunderstanding of japan its worse than the usual japanese otaku theres no way she can learn our culture i
also havent met a samurai since i came to this country i thought that there would at least be one in this town this i s bad buchou also has a misunderstanding there arent any japan which is one of the leading countries of the world wont have samurai walking on the streets though theres one person in this room who would carry a sword around the streets so who is this guy that susan is crazy about what kind of warrior is he then this wont be needed then susan made a sigh while pulling back the string of a bow arrow letter susan if you shoot an arrow in that outfit you would be arrested immediately it would become an international problem shooting with an arrow letter the person inside the armour is a foreign woman staying as an exchange student man i can already imagine it having a big page on the newspaper i wanted to shoot his heart i can even imagine what she would say to the media it would be on the newspaper for days being used as a joke it is i thought an arrow letter is normal in japan yeah i think
it was normal hundreds of years ago you are in the wrong era this is hei sei period its not the azuchi momoyama period if there was a time machine i would be sending you back to the past right away she seems like an unfortunate person who was born in the wrong time and country i was holding my head down and buchou wh o is next to me made a sigh it cant be helped i will teach you how to write a love letter for the whole night spending the night in the same room as a girl it sounds romantic but the one next to me is in armour even if buchou is here this is i started to feel like crying a bit part 5 after a few days buchou and i were at a certain park there is a base right in front of us there are various flags with a certain symbol on it everywhere and at the centre of it there is an armoured musha si tting on a chair its obviously susan she finished writing the love letter safely and she safely gave it to the person she likes i wanted
to see how she gave the letter but she successfully gave her letter and that person is coming to the park today t o give a reply to her confession buchou and i came here because susan wanted us to witness the outcome but to build a base in the place of confession its hard to tell her after she did it to this extreme man just do whatever you want mummy what is that children who came to the park ask their parents no you must not look even the childrens mothers left the park immediately after sensing the weird killing intent yes its like your mummy says children you must not look if you see something like this you would become a good fornothing adult oh my is it some kind of play based on a civil era what do you think granny an old couple is sitting on a bench looking at us thinking its some kind of play but im more interested in the guy c oming here what kind of guy is coming so would it be a warrior from the civil times susan on other hand is shaking a bit while wearing armour she
seems nervous but it looks so creepy there is a bizarre phenomenon occurring in day light looks like h es here when i looked in the same direction as buchou there was someone far away getting closer gashan gashan the sound of metal colliding i have heard a sound familiar to this before the one who appeared from far away is wearing western armour h e held a cone shaped lance in his right hand and a shield on the left his head is covered with a helm that also covers his whole face so i cant see the face i dropped down on the floor holding my head down man im speechless what the heck is that what the fuck is that its a fricken hentai knight who is armoured with illegal weapons bubuchou may i go home now no lets stay and look aaah its amazing its a collaboration of a musha and a knight i didnt want to look at a collabora tion like this i was screaming next to buchou who is enjoying it hey if i look carefully theres an arrow piercing the helm its a direct hit to the brain hey hey hey hey
he turned into a arrowed head knight susan the arrow that person has an arrow piercing his helm instead of a ochi musha its an ochi knight yes i thought about it a lot and the only method i had to give the letter was by using the arrow hand it to him by using your hand think a bit more you could even have i t posted thats an attack you just attacked him its an attack that is an instant kill its a direct hit to the head its an assault isnt that the reason why hes carrying a lance its a splendid lance susan says it shyly dont fall in love with a weapon that is used to pierce through someone is that also the charming point of this guy you fell for damn it why do all my clients end up being weirdos while i was thinking the knight gets closer to susan he came into susans base while making sounds of metal colliding no matter how you look at it it looks like a battle the knight stands in front of susan susan also got up and stood there is an abnormal atmosphere the intensity
is extreme the area was filled with killing intent it seems like there is a warp in the space between them because of the energy they are giving out if you look at this scene no one would suspect that its the scene of a confession thats because no matter how you look at it it looks like a battle scene the knight pierces the ground with his lance violently and took out something its a letter this letter i have read it yes the musha is shaking please stop because its scary its scary because you are responding like a girl it was a wonderful arrow letter for me to let my guard down and get shot it was a good arrow letter eh wonderful eh does the knight have a few screws loose ii was just thinking about shooting the bowhorie kun thinking about shooting thats a thing someone whos trying to kill someone would say wait horie kun is that right so this arrow head knight is called horie kun if its me i would be glad to go out with you arararara she got a good reply he doesnt mean going out as in goin g

my bruised face fixed by asias healing ability in the occult research club room asia seems worried you reap what you sow koneko chan mutters from the sofa which is a bit away from me her mouth is in the shape of an n and her expression didnt look pleasant well of course she will get pissed if she was peeped on getting changed but it was a combo of punches and she didnt hold back i thought i was going to die geez why are you so buchou made a sigh of astonishment ara ara you have to keep the lev el of peeping at girls changing at a moderate level akeno san who always has a smiley face poured some tea for me i got too carried away i will show you anytime when im getting changed the one who made a gay reply was kiba shuuuut up how can i enjoy looking at a guy getting changed i cant even enjoy looking at a girl with an undeveloped body undeveloped glare i received a sharp glare from koneko chan iim very sorry koneko sama isesan you shouldnt be peeping at girls getting changed iif you want to
see the naked body of women that muchi can asia says it while wriggling her body shyly no no you dont have to push yourself asia i want to but thats not it lately this girl has became more daring shes cute b ut i will get confused if the girl i am supposed to protect says that to me yes if you want to see naked bodies you can just tell me i can show you mine at anytime inside the bath and bed buchou sama says it casually im living with buchou and she says that to me im grateful tears are coming out from my eyes buchou always does erotic things to me so my body cant handle it but i cant do anything since im living with my parents and also pinch like this asia pinches my cheek si lently with an unpleasant face part 3 a familiar i replied with a suspicious voice and buchou nods yes a familiar you and asia still dont have one familiar an existence which becomes the hand and foot of us devils i was also told that t hey become handy for the devils job normally handing out the
leaflets are the jobs of a familiar it was also the job for newcomers as well i also handed out leaflets like mad at night while pedalling a bicycle bon a red bat appeared on buchous pal m after making a sound this is my familiar a bat which is the same colour as buchous hair it had a noble atmosphere with only that this one here is mine the thing akeno san summoned was something which looked like a palm size oni ko oni3 this is shiro koneko chan was hugging a white kitten since her name is koneko her familiar is a kitten huh its so cute mine is ah you dont have to tell me you are so cold kiba made a bitter smile at my straight rejection but he made a small bird appear on his shoulder i see so everyone besides me and asia has a familiar buchous bat flies above my head a familiar is a basi c for devils they can help their masters they can be used for information transmission they can be used for persisting you and asia also need one since it can be used for adapting to certain situations
buchou says it while patting my cheek aaah get ting patted by buchou blows away all the pain i received today my onee sama i was feeling entranced by it but then the magic circle on the floor started glowing what happened buchou preparation is set akeno san reports to buchou preparation is s et me and asia are in wonders but buchou then tells it to us with a smile now lets go and capture your familiars carrying out her words that is my master part 4 when the glow for the transport magic circle stopped i was in an unfamiliar forest in this forest there are many familiar devil users living here today i will have ise and asia get their familiars here the forest of familiars haa so thats how it is there are giant trees growing around here so not much sunlight shines through to the ground though a devils eyes still work perfectly in the darkness so it doesnt matter what a dense forest i cant even feel heat around here so it wouldnt be weird if anything popped up get daze4 what kyaa woah asia and i were surprised by the sudden loud voice
and it made us jump asia even hid behind my back the one who appeared in front of us is a young man wearing rough c lothings my name is satooji of madara town im a devil in training aiming to become the familiar master5 nggh a weird guy suddenly appear ed a devil this guy hmm satooji san i brought the ones i spoke of buchou then introduces us to the so called familiar master hee a dull face boy and a blonde beauty huh ok leave it to me if its me any familiar immediately would be get daz e hmm this guy sure does say the word get strongly and dont call me dull face ise asia he is a professional in terms of familiars today we will catch familiars in this forest while receiving advice from him okay yes asia and i nod at buchou i see so i will also get a familiar hmm i wonder what kind of types there are while having that thought satooji san asks us in a friendly manner now what type of familiar do you desire strong one fast one or one with poison dont say something scary like
poison type all of a sudden so what type do you recommend satooji san smiles at my question and gets out a thing that looks like a catalogue the one he points at is a creature with great ferocity that is drawn out on the whole pa ge this is what i would recommend one of the dragon kings chaos karma dragon tiamat its a legendary dragon its also the only female among the dragon kings even until now there hasnt been a devil who has caught her yet that would be obvious si nce its said to be as strong as a maou even if it hasnt been caught its a maou level are you crazy no matter how i look at it it looks like the last boss which appears in an rpg this doesnt look like the level of a familiar its like the super boss the final boss and no one has caught it yet do you know the meaning of recommending i feel as if i was thrown into the last dungeon that sounds good it seems like they will get along since they are both legendary dragons ise you are my adorable servant so
it might be acceptable if you can pull that off the cheerful buchou sama says something so reckless are you trying to kill your adorable servant certainly the power of sekiryuutei is residing in my left arm but i will seriously g et killed its impossible buchou i can tell that we wont be able to get along even from this book its just your imagination ise kun yeah you can do it shut up kibaaaaaaa you go and hunt it damn itttttt i already had a bad start from the beginning i calmed down and asked once again umm i dont need a familiar like this one so arent there any other ones which are friendly and easier to catch hahaha i see then how about this one hydra i was shown the illustration of a gigantic serpent with many heads hmm i cant sense it being friendly from the illustration even if it looks like this maybe it specialises in sewing and making green tea it has sharp eyes sharp fangs and there is a poisonous mark of a skeleton on the illu stration wait there are actually skulls around the serpent in this illustration this one is
amazing it has deadly poison there are no devils in this world which can endure its poison on top of that it is immortal the worst creature in the world whi ch even kills its master see pretty useful right crap i cant keep this feeling im keeping inside me can i punch him buchou can i punch this guy calm down ise hydra is rare so it would be wonderful if i remember there is one deep in this forest we would be able to return by the end of today buchou looks deep into the forest shes really eager to catch it i wouldnt be able to return alive i will get lost and disappear right away if things go wrong i would end up being i nside this hydra san which is useful and friendly satooji san puts his thumb up hahaha you should experience the adventure stop messing with me i dont want a monster which is more powerful than me this boy sure has lots of requests then what would you prefer satooji san who is messing around yeah i want to kill this guy with the dragon inside me arent there any cute familiars
like girl types yeah if you think about it there should be o nes like that then satooji makes a sound with his tongue with an unpleasant expression thats why newbies dont understand anything listen you have to catch powerful familiars and each one has different abilities if you are trying to become a famil iarmaster then you have to catch the same one several times and then pick the strongest male and female among them you have the two breed and make them give birth to their baby with strong abilities and also it seems like he started talking about t he logic of familiars man he sure is annoying i also want a cute familiar asia says while hiding behind me okay i understand satooji san stopped his logic talks and replied with a smile what is this guy looks like capturing a familiar will be a long road ahead part 5 listen up seirei6 gather around this lake satooji san says it with a small voice there is a spacious clear lake in front of us it is glittering with sparkles and it seems like a very sacred lake we are hiding in the shadows near the
lake while hiding our presence yes the water seirei undine living in this lake doesnt show themselves in front of others according to satooji san the water seirei undine is a maiden with a pure heart and beautiful body on top of that they heal your broken heart oh that is wonderful a maiden pure beautiful asia who has those specifications is always with me but thinkin g i could get a familiar which is like asia makes me excited fufufu looks like i can get a step closer to making my harem come true first of all i will make a cute girltype my familiar im sure it would be wearing a transparent robe and it is a beaut iful slender seirei with light blue hair colour aaah undine my undine yes i will make it give me a lap pillow first i will then make her clean my ears then t then finally the o oooppaaaaaaaai man i cant wait bbuchou since it would be my fa miliar i can do whatever i want with it right i try to get confirmation from buchou just in case dont tell me there is a no sexual harassment policy for
your familiar right yes do as you like it would become your familiar after all buchou answ ered like that and i shed tears of joy from it soon there would be a girl who i can do whatever i want with i cant express my joy except by shedding tears oh the lake started glowing undine should make its appearance satooji san pointed towards the lake oh finally i then looked towards the direction satooji san pointed with joy now take me to the dream world and the one that appeared was a being with light blue hair sparkling like lights who was wearing a transparent robe over its gigan tic body the insane biceps the calves which were thicker than my waist and the chest which looks like it has metal inside it and like a veteran warrior it has many scars on its face because of the sudden turn i couldnt believe my eyes i wipe my eye s many times hoping that this isnt reality what the fuck is thissssssssssssssssssssssssssssss that is undine satooji sans violent words reached my ears it is like a fantasy in the other way no no no no matter how you
look at it it is a martial artist in training look those biceps are meant for destroying a humans body it seems like it can conquer the world with just its fists it doesnt even have an opening its a man of valour yeah undine always have a battle while having th eir territory on the line if you arent strong you wouldnt be able to get the lake the world of the seirei is also about power but it sure is a strong looking seirei that is quite rare i recommend you catch it a water seirei specialising in punchin g sure wont be bad undine which specialise in punching a description i didnt want to hear i didnt want to hear such dangerous words it is bad it isnt a healing type at all it is like the killing type i dont need a healing type seirei which h as enormous punch power i cried out loud horrible i never heard of such a horrible thing before but that is the female type you know and it has quite a potential i so didnt want to hear that i covered my face and started crying oooooooooo s o
you are telling me that is a girl aaaagh the truth is so violent ise the world is changing now buchou says it while resting her hand on my shoulder while nodding her head i dont want that kind of change but she has pure eyes im sure she is a girl with a pure heart as well asia says that with a smile umm asia can you not call that thing a girl huh thats weird my tears arent stopping at all ah another one has appeared i heard akeno san say that and i also looked in hope that t his time it will be and what appeared was a light blue hair colour seirei with the same physique sobw why uuoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh iise kun i dont think its something which will make you cry out that much you know kibaaaa i had dreams inside fantasies i was seeking for a beauty of the world thats because buchou who is a devil is super beautiful you would end up having hope in fantasies but what is that why do i have to see some martial artist mak e his appearance i hate it i hate fantasies its okay im
sure there are fantasies which will fulfil ise kuns dream kiba comforts me while rubbing my back he is a good looking guy who i really hate but at times i think he is a good guy oh lo ok satooji san points at the lake when i look the two big build undinefemale are glaring at each other you can sense the hostility between them and the space between them bended with their touki then hit hit hit the thick fist nailed into their opponents stomach or the uppercut cracked the opponents chin one of them low kicked the opponents calves making an explosive sound and the straight punched nailed deeply into the opponents face both of them started bleeding from every part of their body they started showing an intense battle of hitting each other the sacred lake now turned into a battle stadium no thats not whats important eh what are these girls doing its the fight for the territory and both of them look like w arriors with lots of experience satooji san started shaking his head and seemed very interested in it fight for the territory shouldnt they fight in a more fantasy way isnt
there any magic used by seirei and stuff after all violence is the a nswer buchou can i go home im about to cry now you know actually im already crying i want to go home i want to go home with asia even if i catch that thing it doesnt seem like it would use any magic at all it seems like their punches are eve n stronger than the magic they use and how can their big physique become useful in missions it probably cant even hide itself in shadows hahaha look boy the victor will be your familiar the ultimate fight of undine its a wonderful adventure inde ed oh they certainly show a rare way of punching satooji san says it with enjoyment while patting on my shoulder hahaha as if shut up with the adventure craaaaaap i dont want adventure like this how about we n name her dine chan the undine asia says that while being scared and watching the battle in front of us eh is this girl really trying to catch that thing asia no matter how you look at it that dine chan will be too much for us if you
make that as your familiar then you would become pregnant if you stay next to her i will bear the baby if it is ise sans child asia says that clearly yeah what are you saying that isnt the problem eh you will actually bear my children no thats not the issue forget about that dinechan you wont be able to control it asia bbut im certain that dine chan was lonely by herself i know it hmmm she was somehow empathising with that thing it seems even more dangerous now so i put my hand on asias shoulder and tell her while putting on a smile even if that is the case that girl would be able to live by herself look she succeeded in building a body which can break her opponents lets give up on dine chan wait who is dine chan anyway dont give her a name more like which one is dine chan hey boy dine chan is in crisis she just received a seoi nage7 satoooooooooji you shut the fuck uppppp haaa okay lets just move on to another place at this rate there will be no progress in this buchou says it while
making a sigh like this we gave up on dine chan and moved on to another place part 6 the sprite dragon8 satooji nods at my question yeah the sprite dragon just like its name its a dragon which uses blue lightning we moved away from the fight scene of the undine and we were told about the rare dragon while on the way apparently right now there is a super rare dragon which flew into the depth of this forest satooji san suggested that maybe it would be good to catch that but we were introduced to a very dangerous looking last boss dragon called tiamat before i started shivering because of its scary name is that dragon super strong when i asked while shaking satooji san smiles apparently its still a baby if you are going to catch it now is the time you w ould definitely not be able to catch it once it matures it wont be as strong as dragon kings but its placed in the top tier classes for dragons a baby dragon maybe we would be able to catch it hmm this certainly makes me worry top tier dragon i also have the
power of sekiryuutei so our compatibility might be good more than that a dragon sounds cool and strong but i would rather prefer a girl type familiar hmm it sure makes me think hard it certainly does oppai or a dragon while i was thinking seriously satooji san made a loud sound by saying owa when i looked to see what it is about a scale which glows in blue a dragon looking creature which is about the size of an eagle is resting on a branch sprite dragon that is it satooji san was over hyped about it ohoooooo t that is a dragon wow my first time seeing a real one its small but looks awesome its eyes are so lovely sprite dragon it is also my first time seeing one what beautiful scales its glowing in blue just like a blue diamond buchou was looking as if she was deeply moved so its also buchous first time seeing it it must be very rare now i have decided a cute familiar would be good but a rare dragon would be good as well so i choose you9 then it happened when i had made my choice kyaa
asias scream when i turned around a sticky thing was attacking asia tthis is bucho us scream oh there are sticky things on buchou as well when i looked all the girls were being attacked by the sticky things fall splash the sticky gel is falling from the sky did it fall from the trees this gel is moving living thing creature is it alive a slime kiba says it so this is a slime i know it from a game wait it isnt poisonous is it i thought of a dangerous predicament like that but in the next instant that thought disappeared my c clothes are melting just as asia screamed the gel creature started melting the girls uniforms all of the girls uniforms melted and their underwear was exposed buu i started to get a nosebleed what a wonderful turn of events the attacks of the slimes arent stopping and it started to melt their underwear as well uoooooooo a scenery which my eyes cant let go of is happening right in front of me hit koneko chan hits me while hiding her private parts gufu please dont look eeven if you say that those slimes might be
dangerous ah i also saw buchou and asia and akeno san as well save to my brain saved to my brain kiba seems to feel bad so he looked away you sure are a gentleman i will look without holding back then something which looks like a tentacle appe ars from the trunk of a tree and it started to wrap around the girls nnoooo asia screams the tentacle wrapped around asias leg and started to make its way up it went inside her ripped clothes and started to move asias legs oppai butt they are being violated when i looked buchou and the other girls are also having their important parts tangled by the tentacles bbut even if this is improper it seems like a wonderful situation satooji san who was having a proper look at them says it while hav ing a nosebleed this one doesnt have a name and it is a slime which melts clothing and also just mere tentacles these guys often work together to attack their prey even if they are called monsters slime only targets the clothes and the tentacles ta rget womans secretion so they arent harmful what i couldnt believe my
ears a slime which melts clothes a tentacle which eats womans secretions its not a rare slime and tentacles and they are just a nu isance for when you want to investigate the forest it would be the best to use fire on them to get rid of them buchou i will make these slimes and tentacles as my familiars melting clothes eating womans secretions they are the ones i have been loo king for i declared it with my eyes sparkling while cutting off satooji sans explanation fufufu found it i finally found it my familiars my only familiars buchou makes a sigh while burning the slimes and tentacles with fire nooooooo my slime chan and tentacle chaaaaaaaaaaaaaan they are getting burnnnnnnnnnnt you know ise a familiar is very crucial for devils okay think properly understood i closed my eyes and started to think like i thought i will make them my familiars ise only three seconds have passed since you started thinking next to buchou akeno san was burning the slime and tentacles aaaaaaah my my familiar chans are being sent to the heavens they are being burnt very well koneko chan was also tearing the tentacles and
throwing them as if she sees them as pests please dont do that dont bully my tentacle chan step aside ise you have to burn these useless creatures you are in the way buchou has no sympathy shes horrible hell no hell no im goi ng to make these slimes and tentacles my familiars i shook my head while protecting the slimes and tentacles hovering over asia i will protect these guys even with my life these guys are my important comrades friends familiars are our friends they are my comrades buchouuuuu a lecherous familiar like these guys i will never have the chance to catch them these are the guys whom i was looking for i want to fly to the realm using these guys i want to aim high these guys will definitely be usef ul when creating a harem its obvious that they will become useful in many erotic situations isesan umm you are hugging onto me asia is putting on a red face please bear it asia i want to protect these slimes and tentacles there are things t hat i must protect sob surataro shokushumaru my important partners i will definitely protect you guys i
hugged them gently along with asia while shedding tears ara ara looks like he gave them names already akeno san says it cheerfully yes i have given them names it is my first time seeing a devil who craves for these slimes and tentacles this much it truly did surprise me the world is so huge isnt it gremory san satooji san says it while he actually looked very astonished im sorry this boy is true to his greed so he doesnt think properly buchou puts on a sad expression its like she is looking at something pitiful sob i wont go home until i make them my familiars i wasnt going to move even an inch and i heard something flying this way when i lookedthere was a bluescaled baby dragon floating in the air sprite dragon when on earth did it come here buzz buzz a blue lightning starts running through the baby dragons body eh dont tell me that its shock shock shock shock shock shock shock without any time to dodge it strong electric voltage runs through my body aggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggh my whole body is paralysed if this was a cartoon im positive that my skeleton would
have showed up uumm ise san are you okay asia whom i was hugging seems okay what the fuck sprite dragon only gives electric damage to those who it acknowledges as its enemies so it must have thought that the girl isnt its enemy satooji san who is burnt black beside me explains it to me you also received quite a bit of damage from it wait from the explanation you just gave me then its certain that it sees me and you as its enemies kiba was also a bit burnt hes putting on a smile bu t i can sense that he wants to kill that dragon haa when i looked the slime and tentacles which were on asia had turned to ashes impossible my comrades my familiar chan suratarooooooo shokushumaruuuuu uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i cried while embracing their corpses how did it turn out like this this world sure isnt fair looks like it eliminated the slimes and tentacles which were attacking asia maybe this dragon is a male i heard that male dragons will also take a liking to females from other rac es buchou says it while patting the baby dragons head the dragon sure is honest
with his feelings but this is horrible my surataro and shokushumaruhave passed away i feel shocked shit so its a dragon and it is lecherous thats why the girls a re unharmed and it also burnt kiba actually good job on turning kiba black but i still cant forgive you surataro and shokushumaru were lecherous but they werent bad maybe they were living their life very seriously i wiped my tears and got up i then stood in front of the baby dragon surataro and shokushumaru they were really good guys my number 1 comrades and you turned them into ashes i started to shake with rage yeah i wont forgive you i will be the one to take their vengeanc e gaa baby dragon made a sigh snap something inside me made a sound and i snapped a shallow aura starts to envelope my body even the other members were pushed back because of the abnormal intensity im pissed now sprite dragooooooooon while e mitting violent aura i pointed my fist towards it the trees around here started to make noises due to my aura amazing a pulse of demonic power so strong that i have never felt something
like it before ise kun still has powers sleeping inside him i n ever thought it would awaken with something like this overwhelming aura ise why dont you use that power for something more useful akeno san and buchou were both shocked but also astonished im sorry my two onee sama having my greed and desires ta ken away my rage has awakened me the lecherous greed and the pure desire to have sex having those expectations betrayed the rage has pushed forward ise kun kiba tries to analyse the situation calmly thats right casanova no one can stop my wrath its only that the super pervert snapped thats right koneko chan your answer is the most accurate sprite dragon i will not forgive you the slime which melts clothing surataro the tentacle which eats girls secretions shokushumaru the guys w ho i fell in love with at first sight and yet you even buchou and akeno san cant stop me now no please dont come and stop me for guys there are things guys must do ultimate invincible my power of dragon which is said to be the strongest in the world receive this power with your own body
and perish i said the quote used by riser phoenix and moved my hands covered in demonic powers towards the dragon hug you cant bully him asia says it as if she is lecturing me while hugging the baby d ragon i stopped my fist right before i reached the baby dragon sob if asia who is like a little sister to me says that then i wont be able to do anything i was glaring at the dragon but it seemed like it was getting attached to asia and was b eing spoiled by her i hear that sprite dragons open up to those with pure hearts it seems like it really is attached to that girl satooji san explains so that means it completely attached itself to asia well asia does have a pure heart she is a go od girl after all looks like it is ises defeat buchou was smiling while resting her hand on my shoulder haa my demonic power disappeared and i took a breath uumm can i make this dragon my familiar asia asks i guess that will depend on ise how about it ise buchou asks me everyone looks at me uu
it seems like im the villain here no i am the villain i did go crazy because of my sexual desires its not the dragons fault instead it helped asia who was being attacked by the slimes and tentacles yeah i will let asia decide surataro shokushumaru i couldnt take your revenge i shed tears of regret part 7 in the name of a asia argento i order you y you shall become my familiar and respond to my contract we returned to the entrance of the forest asia opened a green magic circle in front of us the sprite dragon is located in the middle of the magic circle and the contract ceremony between asia and the familiar is about to take place of course since asia is a beginne r akeno san is supporting her but it seems like the ceremony is progressing very well akeno san also seems relieved asia is very talented at being a devil unlike me normally the sprite dragon is a dragon who wont pledge to a devil but it seems tha t girl has a very pure heart something like this has never happened before but it seems like the contract ceremony
will finish safely satooji san says that hmm so asia has succeeded in catching a rare dragon in a rare way huh she is amazing after al l the light from the magic circle starts to gradually lose its light because the contract has finished the baby dragon flew to asia and started to play with her ufufu you are tickling me rasse kun rasse when i be came curious about what seems like the baby dragons name asia answers me yes he is a dragon which uses raigeki10 and i also used ise sans name as well even though he uses lightning i want him to be lively like ise san would it trouble you no thats alright well who cares lets get along rasse when i tried to approach it its body started to glow in blue buzz shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock agaaaaaaaaaaah gggggggggga gough u umm rasse kun i wonder why i just received an electric shock i forgot to mention but male dragons hate males from other races satooji san who was also burnt black gives me additional information behind him kiba also was turned black while putting on a refreshing
smile so if its guys they are all the same to you rasse san rasse is a naughty one hes too naughty buchou ufufu the part where he hates men he sure is similar to ise kun oh so you mean he hates the same gender right akeno san like i thought i would have preferred surataro and shokushumaru even if i regret like that they wont return sob why did you guys leave me and die perverts should just die yes its exactly like what you said koneko sama looks like my path to catch my familiar is still far ahead well since asia has caught her familiar this might be a good end life3 memory of oppai miin miin its the beginning of summer outside the cicadas are crying loudly im sitting at the window side of the club room looking out the window today im looking outside with low tension ise what are you doing hug the one hugging me from behind is buchou usually i would say owa bu buchou i would get in trouble if you hug me all of a sudden because of the sensation of your oppai i can feel on my back
but the current me is i ca n only make a big sigh whats wrong its not like you buchou rests her face on my shoulder and asks with a doubtful voice she seems like shes finding it boring because im not responding to her im sorry buchou i was just thinking about my pas t for a bit the past yes yes the sad parting i had when i was in junior school when i was a kid i lost something precious during this season of the year i was looking outside with sad eyes buchou notices that its not a normal atmosphere so she became confused she kisses me on my cheek lightly and says tell me about it i will listen to you okay i want everyone to hear it as well are you sure okay everyone gather up the club members gather at buchous instruction what is it asia tilts her head ara ara what is it about im interested in it akeno san and koneko chan isekuns past i want to hear his worries as his friend are things like this also part of the club activity i dont understand japanese customs kiba and xenovia
gathered as well everyone sits as if they are surrounding me everyone looks suspicious after seeing me feel down then i told them a story about a long time ago when i was seven years old there was a place i visited every time i fin ished school a park in the neighbourhood over there was an occhan11 who did picture story shows for people who went there i was always lookin g forward to occhans picture story shows occhan rung the bell for the start of the story there were few viewers everyone was a kid there were times when it was just me even so occhan showed me the show carefully i loved occhan long long time ago at a certain place geezer and granny were living there on a certain day the geezer went to the mountains for lawn mowing granny went to the river to do washing when granny was doing washing at the river i was waiting for the next development with my heart beating occhan changes to the next picture while looking at me with a smile an oppai flowed down a small me was excited to see the detailed picture of oppai that
was drawn on the whole paper and looked so real yeah i thought that i wanted t o grope oppai like that i also greatly admired the detailed picture occhan drew donbura ko bain bain donbura ko bain bain no matter how you look at it it was a gigantic breast that is bigger than a g cup the size of it the shape of it it was the finest breast there is my heart was racing hearing about an oppai story from a long time ago while i was eating an oppai pudding the oni that was defeated by oppai the geezer who became happy by oppai a youth who received divine punishment by oppai the dog who dug oppai hearing the oppai stories from a long time ago i learnt about the world i asked occhan who was getting ready to go home after finishing the show did occhan also grope oppai occhan answered me with a smile yes i have groped t hem a lot of them boy oppai isnt something you only grope you can suck it eh but that would make you like a baby me back then thought that oppai was only for groping
but i was wrong a boy wont understand yet because you are still a child you will understand when you get older the urge to suck it an adult man still lives everyday life to fight against that urge that time i didnt know what occhan was saying but i just understood that what occhan was saying was something cool listen boy you suck it like this occhan starts sucking the oppai pudding from the tip of it the pudding disappeared into occhans mouth instantly aamazing my heart as a young boy was aroused seeing it here i will give you a couple of these oppai puddi ngs practice at home occhan says it as if teaching his successor i took the oppai pudding home and practiced sucking it very hard while hiding from my parents but i couldnt suck it like occhan i started to realise how great occhan is every time i fa il at it on a certain hot day in summer i was pedalling my bicycle to the usual park with excitement today is the day for the new story occhan wrote a new story about oppai what kind of story will it be a fun
story a sad story is the oppai this ti me big or is it small i couldnt help myself from being excited the thing that appeared in my sight after arriving at the park was hurry we are going geez showing things like this to the children from noon it was occhan who was being taken away by a policeman it cant be why is occhan he didnt do anything bad to me who was a kid occhan was everything i went to the side of occhan who was being taken away occhan occhan why why i got caught by another policeman and i couldnt save o cchan no you cant go near him he is a bad person who showed something he is not supposed to to you kids occhan isnt bad occhan taught me about oppai occhan occhan oppai oppai i screamed while crying i was taught many things by occhan he isnt evil he was just a perv occhan smiled at me and said it quietly boy one day grope oppai then suck it that was occhans last word oy what are you telling to a kid hurry we are going occhan occhan the new story what
about the new s tory occhan was taken away by the power of the state i could only glare at the policeman taking occhan away i couldnt hear the new story what kind of story was it i just became frustrated thinking about it give my occhan back to me give my oppai back to me my at the park where the cicadas were crying at summer i i lost something precious so thats how it is my past i think it was violent i lost my important occhan me who was feeling down looks across at everyone everyone had a n astonished face absurd i became shocked at everyones reaction no matter how you think about it its a story that would make you weep like crazy asia was the only one who didnt seem like she understood and had a face full of questions ara ara so ise kuns urge to have sex came from there akeno san is smiling calmly yes i was troubled on how to react more like that person was taken away because he was a hentai kiba makes a bitter smile no occhan isnt a hentai hes a god i rea lly cant
understand japanese people xenovia shrugs her shoulders and got up from the chair no xenovia that is being rude to other japanese people originally japanese arent worthless people like this kiba tries to support me but am i worthless man who talks about indecent things to a child a real hentai the worst story ever koneko chan who has her eyes half opened gets up from her seat what is it with that reaction the current me exists thanks to occhan i say it with narrowed ey es buchou puts my head onto her breast and hugs my head while calming me down i know ise the one who shaped you into you was that man but i think it would have been okay if you had included it with the story of a gentleman but i cant imagine is ekun who isnt ecchi its ise kun only if he looks at woman with lecherous eyes yes you are right akeno ise who isnt interested in womans breast isnt ise when i see ise looking at my breasts it makes me think that this boy is also healthy today and i can feel relieved buchou and akeno san seem like
they are talking about me are my eyes that lecherous i certainly am enjoying myself to the fullest by staring at buchou and akeno sans breasts senpai who isnt do sukebe koneko chan t ilts her neck while putting on a serious expression eh me who isnt lecherous is that hard to imagine wait even i cant imagine it its occhans will that im enjoying the sensation of buchous breasts with my face like this shit buchous breasts are the best its now evening on the way home after club activity buchou and asia are walking to the side of me since we live in the same house we go home together it seems like today is the worst day i talked about my past but no one had sympathy towards me fine then the memory of occhan is mine only buchou san ise san seems to be in a bad mood asia at times like this it is the best to leave him alone both of them seem like they are saying something but who cares what should i do wit h the feeling i have right now after i got my memory laughed at i was walking down
the road with a complicated feeling then i heard that nostalgic sound ring ring then i looked at the direction where the sound came from i knew that my eyes were fully opened because i got shocked 10 years yes 10 years ring ring that was the bell of the start of the story i saw a familiar man preparing for the show at the park i passed by when i realised it i was walking towards the direction of that man its definitely him that face he looks much older but im not mistaking it is it you occhan i asked the middle aged man timidly the man noticed me he looks into my face for a while and then smiles at me you are i see i realised who yo u are right away you have gotten big boy ah he is he truly is occhan you were alive its an emotional reunion occhan i havent seen him since that day i mean he actually remembered me when i have become this big there were tears coming from my eyes because im so happy occhan you have got more wrinkles yeah thanks to you how many years has
it been about 10 years hahaha boy you have got big did you grope oppai i might have been waiting to get asked this question for 10 years when i think like that there were tears falling down from my cheeks then i nodded with a smile again and again yeah i groped it i groped it oppai was amazing this person is my first oppai then i introduced buchou who came next to m e buchou was troubled over how to react but please let me for today hearing that occhan nodded as if he was satisfied is that so im glad so that boy would have a girlfriend after 10 years a girlfriend with a splendid oppai indeed you have to gro pe them while you are still young then how about it did you understand what i was talking about back then you want to suck oppai dont you yeah i want to suck it occhan i want to suck oppai occhan had a smile on after i said that boy do you w ant to look at the picture show that you couldnt see back then what he took out of his bicycle is the continuation
of my dream that i couldnt see that day my wish that couldnt be granted on that summer day i wiped my tears and answered him with a big smile yeah ring ring the start bell of the show yes the continuation of the story from that day then its the start of the oppai taking geezer a long long time ago in a certain place there was a geezer that digs oppai just like 10 years ago i have the oppai pudding in my hand i sat on the ground listening there is also the conversation from the two behind me i want these two to hear this as well umm buchou san what should i do asia leave him like this but if konek o was here she would have said koneko you were here he is the worst i just ignored those harsh words directed at me as i was listening to the geezer talking about tits life4 the oppai of tennis part 1 hello everyone it sure is a hot summer right now i am staring at a dictionary hmmm its deep the thing that i was searching for sure has a deep meaning to it
isesan what were you searching for asia comes next to me and stares at the dictionary yeah i was looking for th e origin of the word oppai o oppai asia seems troubled with how to respond but im serious it has always bugged me oppai it has a wonderful ring to it i think the japanese person who said this word first should be left in history there ar ent many words that actually grasp hold of mens hearts the only beautiful words i know that can stimulate my heart are oppai and raw tits i wanted to know why japanese people began to call womans breasts oppai so i searched for the reason t here are many theories the theory where oh yummy turned into oppai the theory where ancient koreans used to call things you suck ppai so people started to think maybe that was the root of it the one which has the highest possibility is the first one what do you think asia eeven if you say that i think oppai is something which are delicious for babies thats why the oh yummy theory perhaps huh would this be counted as sexual harassment w well
lets let it slide then but i do thin k that oppai are something delicious for any guy of all ages i was about to say that but stopped myself this is bad i shouldnt teach weird things to asia who trusts me a lot i have to change the topic buchou who went to the student council room sur e is late i changed the subject and then buchou and kaichou might be discussing something very serious by the way ise kun and asia chan would both of you like green tea akeno san poured green tea for me and asia all of the members in the occult research club are waiting for buchous return since she went to the student council room oute12 its my win muu i have no more options l ooks like it is my loss kiba and xenovia are playing shougi on the table nearby with this its xenovias five losing streak the one who is watching their game is koneko chan do you also want green tea gasper kun akeno san talked to the box in the corner of the room tthank you very muccccch a voice came from the box yes gasper
is inside that box gasper get out of the box and drink the green tea i said that while making a sigh but this guy just cries about it im s sorrrrrrry no not outside like this he is afraid of other people so hes always inside the box hes a troublesome junior indeed im back i just returned now the one who entered the room is buchou with buchou here that makes everyone present now part 2 durin g the occult research club conference buchou began a discussion while putting on a troubled face i have to hand in the club activity report eh didnt you just hand that in before i said that the reason why buchou was away is because she went to h and in the club activity report to sona kaichou buchou says it while making a sigh what i submitted just now is the report for the actual club activity based on the relation between ufo and devils the problem is the report based on our activity as de vils so many things happened lately that i forgot all about it unlike last year the due date for it is earlier this year the
devil club activity reportyou say i tilted my head at words i heard for the first time kiba then explains it to me buchou who is a pure devil is actually required to attend the school in the underworld for high class devils shes studying in japan as a special privilege student if she doesnt attain the units for the devil school at kuou academy then she will be force d to return to the underworld for the current devils who have the responsibility to maintain their kind it is because of that that they welcome those who were reincarnated from a human as devils hmm buchou who was born between puredevils seems to be in a difficult position akeno san then gives additional explanation attaining credits in buchous case other than making a pact with humans she can also attain them in other means such as researching about types of monsters and youkai in japan the tr uth is we her servants were also allowed a bit of freedom by helping her with the research ah i see thats why buchou built the occult research club so the reason why we her servants can live in the human world
is because we are working in the occ ult research club as her servants it means we need a job and a role to live in the human world buchou then says it while looking at everyone around the table thats why i will create the report which needs to be submitted to the underworld now thats why i want to know the present state of the monsters and youkai living in this town as usual lets go and ask the knowledgeable kappa13 who li ves in the swamp located on the outskirts of town kappa you mean the kappa which has a plate on its head which loves cucumber and lives around the water kiba then puts his hand up and informs buchou buchou that kappa returned to his homeland he sa id that he will inherit the family business to cultivate cucumbers so he returned to his homeland that would be a more stable future rather than aiming to become a rapper it seems like something happened and buchou nods her head seeming to acknowl edge the situation wwhat is this about the rapping kappa i ask kiba the kappa left its home because it didnt want to
inherit the family cucumber business and started living in this town it was fond of rapping i often listened to his song shirik odama rhapsody what a bizarre name what kind of rhapsody is it the light of the town which dries my plate my anger which can not be conveyed i will just take your shirikodama ooh koneko chan suddenly started to rap koneko chan was his fan kiba says that are you serious so koneko chan likes rap but it sure has unique lyrics is it because it is a kappa but it seems like he went to his homeland because his father got a plate shortening disease his family has a rare and old youkai way of cultivating cucumber so with this they would be able to pass on the traditions then it looks like we have to ask the gossip loving dullahan that lives in the old mansion located in the fourth district dullahan buchou said something i didnt know so i ask xenovia answers instead shes referring to the headless armoured knight it rides on a huge horse while carrying its head with its arm its a monster which declares peoples death and it mainly
lives in europe i have defeated them a couple of times as well to be expected from the former exorcist who came from the vatican looks like monster hunting is her specialty kiba then puts a thick book in front of me monster encyclopedia when you say the name of the monster you want to look up it will automatically open the page for you for example dullahan then the book opened by itself and the pages began changing automatically oh a magical phenomenon then it stopped when i looked there is a illustration of a headless knight alon g with symbols i cant read these symbols must be devil letters i still cant read all of them yet i cant read the descriptions but i understood the characteristics of dullahan from the illustration that dullahan had a serious hernia a few days ago and is hospitalised now akeno san tells buchou while reading the documents in her hands hes headless and has a hernia i dont understand so you are telling me that the head it is carrying can also receive a hernia buchou sighed after hearing aken osans report i see looks like dullahan is also having difficulties
judging from their conversations it seems like they cant get in contact with the informant i then pointed to the box which the half vampire gasper is in then buchou how about w e submit a report about a rare vampire in a box i dont think there are any vampires who go inside a box rather than a coffin sssenpaiiiiiiiiiiiiiii w what are you sayinnnnng the box screamed i approached the box and tapped on it you are buch ous servant so you will have to cooperate what kind of box do you prefer how does it feel inside are there differences between boxes made from different makers wait dont you think it would be faster just to teleport this box along with you to the u nderworld uwaaaaaaaan ii will be shipped away by ise senpaaaaai vampire in a box and that will be sent from the country which produced it while gasper and i were having a conversation like that buchou says it while sighing geez i understan d lets find another way another way do you have something in mind buchou nods at my question there is a human who is very knowledgeable about monsters in
this academy thats something i heard for the first time part 3 hit hit the sound of a ra cquet hitting a ball was coming from the tennis court i followed buchou and set foot in the tennis courts apparently the person buchou is looking for is here more than that like i thought girls tennis wear is wonderful and those bloomers worn under t he skirt that i can even see from over the fence even if they arent pants they are stimulating in their own way more than that those legs their thighs are the best tennis during summer is the best after all its the wild beast hyoudou uooooo i was caught peeking from behind the fence and i received a booing from the girls maybe its because im a perv so the girls hate me very much hmph it doesnt matter since i get along with buchou and asia but just looking at them should be something t hat is allowed shut up its not like you will lose something so it should be alright being watched by you feels like we are losing something important if you want to watch then bring kibakun iyaa dont
have me within your sights help me kiba kun shit they are treating me like dirt do you prefer good looking guys that much damn you kiba please come with me next time if you are with me then i can watch them as much as i want hurry ise we are going buchou was troubled by this situ ation and she has her hand on her forehead im sorry buchou it seems like my thoughts go elsewhere when my ero sensor starts to respond so buchou does this person know that you are a devil tentatively this campus also takes in humans that are fr om special backgrounds and that have good relations with devils so they should be told about the devils who have this school as their base buchou and i were talking while sitting on one of the benches hmm so this school still has many secrets that i a m unaware of we are waiting at the place where were supposed to meet but no one has come yet probably because we came too early i couldnt take my attention away from the girls so i was looking towards the court then i heard the
footsteps of a horse ohohohoho how are you doing rias san its very rare for you to come here so i welcome you a woman appeared while making a big laugh on top of a big horse she has her brown hair twirled in a roll elegantly wait shes riding a horse in this school i know this person she is the captain of the tennis club abe kiyome senpai leave the check on beautiful girls to me but what surprised me even more is the one behind her a headless armoured knight was riding behind her uwaaaaah he really doesnt have a head hiheeeeeeeeeeeeeeen the horses cry a black fur horse its eyes are glittering and are giving a suspicious glow its breathing hard from its nose what is this horse which seems like it belongs to the conqueror of the end of century14 abesenpai gets off the horse and calms it down at the same time the headless knight also gets off his horse ufufu its a good horse dont yo u think a few days ago the head of dullahan mr smith was hospitalised so i was asked to look after it in the mean time senpai
says it pridefully this is the horse of a monster no wonder it had weird vibes coming from its body but it isnt someth ing a mere high school girl can handle and this here is mr smiths body it doesnt even have a head but it still tried to bow his head he must be greeting us so this is a dullahan isnt it bad if a monster is walking around the school i think its head was hospitalised because of having a hernia though it seems like its body is fine just looking at someone wearing armour during summer makes me feel hot and its carrying a watermelon in its arm ara bringing a monster within the campus is ag ainst school rules buchou says that to abe senpai i think its more than just against the school rules buchou during the time that its head is hospitalised the body kun can act by himself correct thats why im taking care of it along with the hors e but i thought giving them free food wont be good so i gave them jobs to do as the tennis clubs mascot character dullahan the headless honda kun the watermelon
is a replacement for his head dont you think it fits with the season for summer mascot no no no it cant be no matter how you look at it this is a monster it doesnt have a head its scary its moving around without a head i dont even understand having a watermelon as a replacement for its head wait honda what do you me an by honda i said that but buchou nods her head as if she was convinced we cant help it if it is a mascot buchou eeh you are alright with it it doesnt have a head you know the head isnt a problem it is a problem buchou it doesn t have a head we cant allow it to move without a head no matter how you look at it its a supernatural being kaichou said the same thing and agreed with it senpai also said that thats impossible even kaichou allowed it it doesnt have a head kyaa honda kun your western armour is also shinning today a headless mascot is a new type of vibe indeed so cute he started receiving cheers from the girls over the fences dullahan responds back
by wavering his hands uooooooo what popularity i do think it is the wrong type of popularity boom but is a headless knight popular amongst current high school girls hyoudou on the other hand should die get away from rias senpai beast you pest honda kun take hyoudous head eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh so a headless knight is more popular than me impossible no matter how you look at us im more human looking even if im a devil im sure i am prettier than a headless knight i also have a head a headless knight who rests his hand on my shoulder no its honda hondaaaaaaaaaaaa why are you more popular than me when you dont have a head so not having a head would make you more popular with the tennis club huh that is it huh that must be it huh buchou please cut my head off it would be a cheap price if that is what it would take for me to become popular cut off my head please calm down ise you will die if i do that sob i know that i know that but i felt down and senpai asks buch ou so then rias san
what business do you have with me the captain of the tennis club abe kiyome san im sorry to bother you but may i interview you who is a beast tamer i would also be happy if you would tell me a few things about the monsters a nd youkai that you have under your control buchou asks her but no i dont want to abesenpai refuses immediately why do i have to explain myself to you who is a devil im grateful for having been accepted on this campus when i am from a specia l background but this and that would be two different things correct it also seems like rias san has connections with many people from different industries so there wont be any reason for you to interview me specifically correct mggggh somehow her a ttitude towards buchou pisses me off but buchou continues calmly so wont having a connection with me be beneficial then abesenpai laughs loudly while putting her hand on her mouth ohohohohohohohoho you have quite the confidence in yourself but having a connection with you feels like it will become scary afterwards so at the same time i would also like to
have a relationship with kaichou while distancing ourselves a trade with a devil needs to be done carefully or else i might have my soul take n away correct buchou put on an astonished face at abe senpais words i see so this is how non devil people think of us i was working hard in the world of devils when i became one and before realising it i have blended in with the way devils do things but for non devils devils are symbols of evil a contract would mean paying the price of something equivalent so contracts with devils might be thought of as something scary i would also be scared if a devil asks for a pact if i was still a human even buchou was making a bitter smile nowadays we dont do such serious things you know i will just invite you for tea or dinner normally will you still not accept it the tea made by akeno san is the best i also support buchous invitatio n to her then abe senpai seemed like she thought of something and put on a lecherous smile ufufufu i just thought of something interesting it wont be
fun if we do this for free so how about this lets have a tennis match between me and the monsters under my control against rias san and the occult research club how about if the loser has to obey whatever the winner says for free hey hey we suddenly have a tennis match now and also that winning condition ara that seems interesting i also k now how to play tennis so if we win how about you cooperate with the interview for our report then so what would you desire if you win kiyome san oooo buchou agreed with it immediately you sure like having matches onee sama kiyome senpai then lo oks at me and takes a good look at me by the way are you the famous welsh dragon rumoured in the business world who is also known as sekiryuutei eh yes i am indeed usually i wont feel bad to be looked at by a pretty senior but somehow he r eyes are scary how should i put it eyes of a dangerous collector i never had someone look at me like that so im really scared i have decided if i win then can
i borrow him a rare dragon would be the best indeed he is a servant of a devil s o having him would be impossible but how about borrowing him for a while no buchou rejects it immediately with a smile her smile was giving out a scary atmosphere you are s scaring me buchou buchou is someone who takes care of her servants buch ou especially adores me and she is very strict about discussions like this buchou pulls me to her so i wont be taken away this is my important servant if its a wish like that then i wont let you touch him seeing buchous reaction abe senpai ma kes a sigh then lets make it that we never had this discussion we agree with your condition then someone agrees to abe senpais condition when i turned around it was akeno senpai if we win we will have kiyome san help us with our report if ki yome san wins then you will borrow ise kun temporarily you are okay with those conditions correct eh you dont need to ask me about it honda patted my shoulder and felt sympathy for me ah maybe honda is
a good guy hold on akeno buchou tries to argue with akeno san but akeno san then says it buchou we just have to win if we win then everything will be solved buchou tries to say something to akeno san but she made a sigh and nods like i thought they dont care about my opinion afte r all yes i understand getting buchous approval abe senpai laughs loudly ohohohohohoho then it is settled the truth is it would be foolish for you to challenge me who is the captain of the tennis club so train as much as you can my adorable m onsters that i am in control of can play tennis perfectly as well i will show you how high class devils play tennis i wont hand over my adorable ise to you im looking forward to it ufufu oh yes if i get hyoudou kun then i will adore him in a d ifferent way both of them put their faces closer and laugh scary their faces are smiling but i can sense murderous intent from them both of them are serious i ibecame the object of the bet what will happen to me im
sorry ise kun akeno san a pologises to me while hugging me the sensation of o oppai if i didnt say that then buchous objective wouldnt progress at all i will also do my best for the tennis match yyes im okay with it i couldnt argue if akeno san is hugging me every thing will also be alright if buchou wins but im also curious of what will happen to me when i am temporarily under abe senpai her gaze of a collector is scary but she is a beauty she even said she will adore me m maybe i would be able to have an awe some experience such as bathing with her i just cant stop imagining about it im a servant who is unfaithful to its master and is very lecherous but i havent played tennis that much part 4 the day of the match ufufu i will applaud you for not ru nning away abesenpai who was waiting for us at the tennis court welcomes us with a suspicious smile on the other side of the fence different types of monsters are glaring at us so those are monsters and youkai that are under abe
senpais control the re are quite a number of them all of them are giving weird vibes and they are scaring me the mascot character the dullahans body honda waves his hand at me honda you are a good guy after all we will have ourselves win today buchou declared it co nfidently buchou really is eager to do this there would be two single matches and one double match the team who gets two victories wins rias san and i will have to participate the remaining players will be determined by drawing lots the drawing lot was prepared by abe senpai she sure has good preparations but please dont pull out my name im not confident in it it also feels like i would pull buchou behind so i hope any of akeno san kiba or xenovias name is drawn out please if the tip of t he lottery is blue then it would be a single match if red it would be doubles singles singles oh they pulled it out the singles would be akeno san and xenovia my wish came true doubles buchou will be one of the players for the doubles then please let either kiba
or koneko chan be her partner asia who is no good at sports and me who is crap at tennis wont be useful i pulled the ticket while closing my eyes when i lookedthe tip of the lottery is red looks like my partner is ise let s do our best uwaaaaaaah seriously buchou has a smile but i have a pale blue face instead i felt chills on my back this puts a lot of pressure on me i will definitely pull buchous leg so like that its akeno sans match her opponent is lets do our best it was a girl monster who has both arms as wings uwaaaaaah cute so there are monsters like these as well so its a harpy its a winged monster majority of them are females buchou explains it to me for real the world of monst ers is full of mysteries since there are even cute girls like her more than that her oppai are huge there are bird like claws growing from her legs but 70 of her body is that of a human i cant resist it harpy chan holds the tennis racket with its wi ngs and confronts akeno
san on the court akeno san do your best i send her a cheer as loudly as i can and inside my heart i was also shouting out do your best as well harpy chan im such a lecher but knowing that there are cute monsters like h er makes me feel happy ah i started to think that maybe a harem of monsters might be good too ara ara you are full of openings harpy chan iyaaan this devil onee san is so strong the match ended with akeno san dominating the match and we receiv ed one victory yes if xenovia wins the next match then our team automatically wins the game so there will be no need for me to play in the doubles now its my turn xenovia headed to the court while spinning her racket xenovia said she doesnt hav e much experience in sports involving balls but she has amazing athletic talent so she would definitely pull it off pleased to have you challenging me xenovias opponent is a woman whos lower half body is that of a snake uooooooo even though her lowerhalf is that of a snake shes still quite even this
monster chan is quite a beauty its a bit unfortunate that she has no thighs but she has boobs that alone is enough for me lamia tribe i see like i thought majority of her kind must be fem ales what so there are still monster tribes where majority of them are girls amazing the world is so big indeed maybe i should go and catch a monster one day i want to go to a village filled with girl monsters my dream was expanding and i was fant asising about it then honda the dullahan came and served the watermelon im grateful but what point is there to change the watermelon which was a replacement of your head into a desert honda but if that girl is a snake then wont it be harder to mov e maybe this will be xenovias win since she can move her body freely thats what i thought mggh you are pretty good xenovia was having a hard time over there the snake girl was stronger than i thought possibly because her lower body is a snak e it allows her to be in control of her court without moving but just stretching
her body and just like a snake she is persistent and she can endure normal attacks shes one of those types who wait for the overturn victories im sorry it was due to me being weak xenovia apologises to buchou at the end of a long match xenovia lost uwaaaaaah then this makes me have a serious responsibility since i would have to participate in the last match it wont be a problem since ise and i will settle this so all of you dont to have to worry about anything buchou is filled with spirit do i also have to be resolved then i ended up coming out for the doubles match as well my partner isyuki onna come here my adorable yuki onna chan abesenpai sa ys it towards the crowd of monsters are you for real yyuki onna i then imagined a beautiful youkai wearing a thin kimono you are talking about the yuki onna which you meet when you get lost in the mountain then have a fateful meeting with it then it comes down to your village by turning into a human right that yuki onna which eventually becomes your wife in the end right
first harpy then lamia and now yuki onna please freeze me to death yuki onna samaaaaaaaa hokyooooooooooooooooooooooou then a white gorilla makes a howl in front of me bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang it started banging on its chest with its thick arms like a drum abe senpai then introduces the gorilla i will introduce you to her she is christie a yuki onna a nd also known as a yetifemale christieeeeeeeeeee i became so shocked that my eyes would pop up out from the violent truth and its casual name eeeeeeeeeh yuki onna dont lie its just a big white gorilla ah but it has a pretty ribbon on its head but this is something which can not be forgiven fuck off yuki onna sama isnt some hairy thing like this which starts drumming on its head does it even know what drumming is its the behaviour of a gorilla that it does towards its enemies and its drumming like it its just a gorilla this is a gorilla i argued while shedding tears of blood abe senpai then gets mad dont be foolish christie is a splendid yuki onna this girls mother was a very
fine yuki onna that drove away groups of mo untain climbers to protect the mountain of course they would run away anyone would run away if something like this shows up imagine encountering a big white gorilla do you think there is any other option besides running away even a banana which see ms like it will work wont be useful in a snowy mountain and will be stiff like a rock you can only use it to hammer down nails with look look look its using its fist against the ground to knuckle walk right in front of us a gorilla its a gorilla with the scientific name of gorilla gorilla a snow gorilla has come down to peoples town rather than freezing me to death it feels like it would punch me to death with its gifted body uho uho it even said uho uho its completely a gorilla ise yuki onnas freezing breath is powerful if you get hit by it you will turn into a statue of ice buchou eh this seriously is a yuki onna the yuki onna that appears in books and television are beautiful the ribbon on its head is so pretty that
it makes me want to kill it wait what is a freezing breath i never heard of such terminology for tennis reality is more strange than what is said in books ise keep that in mind noooooooo i dont want that reality i dont care if it is just a dream i love those erotic yuki onnaaaaaaa a freezing breath gorilla is just a monster it should be named as freezing gorilla go ristie instead go home go back to the mountaaaaaaaains christie it seems like he is very interested in yuki onna you know beauty sure is a crime abesenpai just said something dangerous please dont i have no interest in gorilla dont say such things to make the gorilla be aware of me but after the gorilla took a good look at me uhoholol it laughed and put on a smile as if it looked down on me snap something snapped inside me shit i started to have enthusiasm in this match after being pissed christie no go ristie isesan i will be cheering for you please dont lose against christie chan do you r best ise kun im waiting to see your amazing side asia and akeno
san are cheering for me uoooooo if they are saying that then i cant let them down i felt something hot flowing within me because of my rage against the gorilla and the cheering fro m the girls shit if it comes to this then i have to do it buchou i can do this well said ise to be expected from my servant devil im not confident in tennis but i have to do it i cant turn back now i cant show my uncool side to the girls my lecherous gut somehow pushed me forward but something appears within my sight booooon a sound of the air vibrating goristie was swinging something unimaginable what the heck is that big ass racket the enormous racket within goristies hand i t can only be seen as a weapon i was so shocked that my eyes were about to pop out again but abe senpai answers normally its a specially made racket its a blunt weapon that is a weapon its so huge that it seems like it can even beat down enormou s monsters that isnt a racket eh am i going to be slamed down with that thing if
that thing comes down at me then i will have myself cut down to my guts and now the matchno the death match was about to start buchou won the coin toss and chose the serve order and abe senpai got the right to choose which side of the court to use bounce bounce buchou bounces the ball on the ground a few times and then throws it up high she then smashes it the ball which is hit by buchou bounces once on the o pponents court and abe senpai hits it back then their rally started uo uwaah i tried to react to the ball but i cant follow the movements of the two veterans both buchou and senpai can continue their match even though their partners arent doing anything h hmm even though i started the match with high spirits am i even needed when i looked at goristie she isnt moving and seems bored but she still has the scary pressure coming from her body it couldnt be helped so i decided to look at bu chous legs and bloomers aaaahthose white thighs of buchous the size of her thighs are the best christie the ball
went your way abesenpai shouts it seems like the ball went towards goristie while i had my eyes taken away by buchous legs the sn owgorilla then made sharp eyes she doesnt look like a yuki onna after all uho bang the explosive sound echoes throughout the court and it doesnt even sound like its coming from a racket then something goes past me very quickly baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan g i heard the sound of something breaking behind me when i turned around timidlya huge crater was formed over there oooooooooooooooi the court is destroyed i know that it happened with goristies hit but the ball where is the ball isekun watch out the ball blew up with that hit kiba says that to be expected from the knight kiba both his physical ability and eyesight are good no no the ball blew up you say are you serious so goristies hit not only destroyed the court but also the ball i will be killed i will die if i get hit by that thing go back to the jungle damn gorilla the rally continues i also went in and somehow hit the ball back thats wrong christies home land is japan
alps christie is japan made are you saying that japan alps is a foreign country i said that to abe senpai while continuing the rally i have some confidence now when i was feeling like that goristie opened her mouth wide buuuuuuuuuuuuun a blizzard is coming from goristies m outh wow its freezing so cold so this is the freezing breath she really is a monster freeze ah my hand which is holding on the racket froze my movement has become bad the opponent starts to gain points ohohohoho looks like it is our victory abesenpai laughs loudly while putting her hand on her mouth ku i have no way to beat that ice gorilla monster so i will turn into the tennis captains toy at this rate huh t that might be good but it feels like buchou will hold a grudge against me after that lately buchou became strict about those sorts of things i was having a hard time in the match and the headless knight approaches me honda what are you doing honda separated his armour up in the air and points at them with his thumb are you telling me to wear the armour honda
puts his thumb up and gives me a sign language where he is saying that is correct why we are enemies you know honda took out a panel like thing and writes something with a marker pen im also mad th at the yuki onna is a female yeti wear it we will get rid of her i couldnt stop the things coming out from my eyes hondaaaaaaaaaa thats right when we were introduced to a harpy and lamia we will also think that a yuki onna would be a beauty as well right yeah i know how you feel honda a monster like that shouldnt be allowed to exist honda you and i are just a novice tennis devil and a headless mascot knight but yes if we combine our powers then we will have the chance to attain v ictory honda writes down what im feeling onto the panel yeah if its us then we can do it i wore honda and stood up on the battlefield again shit its hot in here maybe because its summer so it is like a super hot hell but i can get over th is with my spirit buchou i still
have my head theres nothing to fear when we have a head yyes you are right buchou is pushed back at the pressure i am giving out a dragon knight with a head its burning with something passionate to be expected from ise senpai he sure does unexpected things like wearing the armour of dullahan it looks cool but also uncool xenovia and gapser were getting heated up with my appearance and koneko chan is tilting her head lets teach the ice gor illa how powerful the power of dullahan with a head growing out from it really is that day we became one and ran through the battlefield together part 5 it is our loss it cant be helped i will participate in your interview abesenpai says tha t while finding it dull we won my power while wearing dullahan was more than we imagined along with how much anger we had towards the gorilla honda its not coming off i couldnt take the armour off my hand moved by itself and wrote something on a panel sorry because of the curse of wearing me it wont come off for a while thats insane you must be joking are
you a cursed armour or what tell me about that first i was screaming and abe senpai says it to me that would be a problem b ecause of the agreement for being a mascot we need to have honda kun remain in the tennis club until dullahans head is cured so what are you telling me to do about it then how about we have hyoudou kun work in that state will that be okay rias san yes i dont mind if it is to help the tennis club in that state kiyome san wont be able to do anything with ise so i can feel safe about it buchou nods at abe senpais suggestion buchou you are too cruel uho i had teary eyes and the ice gorilla was gazing at me with burning eyes eh what is that reaction it seems like christie got her heart taken away by hyoudou kun in armour during the match just now abesenpai says something impossible uooooooo thats absurd so you are tell ing me that our strong will brought victory to us along with a tragedy uhoho goristie approaches me while having her eyes in the shape of a heart
i felt danger so i ran honda seemed like he felt the same way as me so we ran very fast but goristie followed us with threatening speed by knuckle walking fuck off why are you also that fast damn ice gorillaaaaa nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i dont want a gorilla to fall for meeeeeeeeeeee like this i became a mas cot of the tennis club for a while and worked along with goristie it was a living hell because goristies gaze was hot and the inside of honda was also hot during that time buchou completed her report safely that is good though for me it was a summe r in which i had the worst experience of my life life5 hell teacher azazel part 1 greetings everyone the school has just entered the summer holiday i feel like enjoying this long holiday i feel that way but i have my head held down b ecause of the scene in front of me iche carry me the crimson haired little girl asks me to lift her up uu carry me next to her a blonde little girl is crying little girls resembling buchou and asia are in front of me and buchou
and asia thems elves arent anywhere in the house when i woke up this morning both of them were gone and i was having trouble because instead there are two little girls but these girls i know its insane but are they when i was being suspicious of this situatio n knock knock someone was knocking on the door isekun rias asia chan its morning you know the one who enters my room is akeno san araara so many children that was akeno sans response after seeing this scene uumm akeno san i really d ont understand i am getting my cheeks pulled and having my hair messed up by the two little girls akeno san puts her hand on her cheek and begins thinking for a while and then she says with a smile its summer holiday but lets call all the club m embers to this house like this it was decided to have an emergency meeting of the occult research club part 2 with vice president akeno sans single call the occult research club members gathered in the living room of my house everyone is looking at the children with weird expressions the girl who looks like
asia is hiding behind me and the girl who looks like buchou is sitting on my lap it seems like they have become attached to me but they sure do look like buchou and asia xenovia looks at t he two little girls while tilting her head more like i think they are buchou and asia san kiba says are you serious kiba so these two are really buchou and asia after all yeah kiba affirms clearly and nods his head i did have a vague feelin g they were they are buchou and asia no matter how you look at them but why did they turn into little girls i cant help but think that they lost their memories as well however i dont think theyve completely lost their memories since they called me iche i think there was a technique that turns you into little girls koneko chan said it quietly as if she remembered something koneko chan is there really a technique like that yes since devils can change their appearances depending on th eir demonic powers the one who answered me is akeno san who is pouring tea she continues and gives me more of an
explanation you know how its said in legends that devils appear in the form of an old lady or small child that is exactly true and devi ls can change their appearance to their liking when they have reached a certain age its normal for a middle aged woman to have a younger appearance in the world of devils in comparison the majority of men tend to have the appearance of their true age i see i see so you can make your appearance look how you desire depending on how you use your demonic powers then buchou and asia turned into little girls by using demonic powers and what were they trying to do though even in those cases you don t lose your memories akeno san put her hand on her forehead while having a troubled expression this is the rebound of the technique azazel sensei says while drinking tea rebound sensei nods at my question yeah when someone with a high richne ss of demonic power uses a technique they are not familiar with sometimes they make a big mistake with it so the techniques comes back at them then buchou failed at using the technique it
also seems like they lost their memories it seems like it because of the kickback of the technique they also had their memories sealed along with temporarily turning into children but for a devil such as rias to make a mistake she probably imagined something else strongly while activating the technique any way to revert them back to normal we either have to wait for a while or we need to have someone with the power of anti spell for buchou to fail a technique seriously what happened even if i look at the mini buchou sitting on my lap she just tilts her head dubiously iche you have a weird face but she really is cute it means that this is her when she was a child right no wonder her brother loves her so much uu asia also wants to sit from behind me the teary eyed mini asia says that wh ile looking at the mini buchou sitting on my lap with envious eyes aaaaah even this one is cute shes so innocent that my desire as her guardian is becoming very high thats weird i dont have a slight fetish towards lolis is this perhaps the
love that fathers have towards their daughters or is it brotherly love towards a sister either way mini buchou and mini asia are little girls who have more impact than i can imagine bbuchou and asia senpai they are so adorable the one who says that timidly is gasper yeah gasper try making both of them laugh i say something that a senior would say gasper is shocked but nods his head slowly he then searches inside his bag and he took out a paper bag i have a bad feeling about this zun gasper made holes in the paper bag using his index finger and middle finger put and then wears it over his head i knew it look buchou asia senpai its a paper bag you get a hundred times more courage when you wear this the two sparkling red e yes which appear from the holes in the paper bag are directed towards the two little girls fue iya minibuchou and asia cling to me and they are shaking just as i thought they are scared paper bag gasper is a no no by the way paper bag gasper is the power up form i gave to
the hikikomori vampire who has a phobia of other people by wearing the paper bag his heart gets stronger so he can confront other people but his appearance will turn into that of a pervert and he becomes a mons ter who causes great fear to others that is the end of my explanation heeeeeeeeeeeey you gaspeeeeeer i hit the paper bag pervert away of course what the heck are you doing wwwwwhat are you doing gasper protests as if he doesnt underst and its not what are you doing what are you trying to do by approaching buchou and asia while turning into your paper bag form they will get scared you are really scary in that nno i just wanted to tell them that by wearing the paper bag you will overflow with courage it wont from other peoples perspective you just look like a perv who is approaching little girls damn it i was dumb for asking you uu it was scary im not scared rias never cries asia is shaking and buchou is acting strong while clinging to me they sure are cute oh its alright its okay now since i have taken down gasper i
pat both of their heads gently uu senpai is horrible im going to shut myself in cardboard vampire is gaspers stationa ry mode when this cross dressing boy with a pure heart who has a phobia of other people has something happen to him he escapes into the cardboard box and he shuts himself in his own world dont copy him everyone you might get exported by mistake however buchou and asia chan certainly are adorable maybe it might be alright if ise kun and i raise them like this akeno san says it with enjoyment me and akeno san yes ise kun will be the father and i will be their mother that would make us h usband and wife husband and wife hearing those keywords i started to imagine a scene in my mind im back i return home from work araara welcome home dear the one who appears in the entrance is akeno san in an apron papa welcome home papa play with me the ones who welcome me back are mini buchou and mini asia hey you two papa is tired from work so you cant be reckless okay no im going to play with papa
asia was waiting like a good girl akeno its okay now my daughters lets play together hahahaha mou you are too soft on these two wonderful its really wonderful i would admire that situation a lifestyle like that might be good ise senpai you are drool ing while having lecherous eyes it seems like he went to a world of his own hahahaha he must have experienced that lifestyle within his head ise kun sometimes goes away from the real world koneko chan and kiba are talking like that ah even if it was just temporarily i imagined a wonderful lifestyle while doing something like that azazel sensei stands up and then says well i will look for a way to dispel it you guys also look for a way you guys would be in trouble if it stays like this right lets call each other when we find out something so well split up temporarily roger every club member apart from me responds to sensei ara we are splitting temporarily so we dont have any solution right now i will start by checking back from the traces of riass demonic powers i will check ise kuns room which was
the place the technique was activated akeno san heads to my room after saying that then how about koneko chan and i start looking from other places then yes kiba and koneko chan also leave the room fumu i dont understand anything about demonic powers then i will train gasper hey vampire come out of the cardboard box if not i will cut you hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii xenovia senpai is bullying me xenovia exits the room while carrying the screaming cardboard box so then i will leave these two to you for a bit ise sensei also goes i am left behind in the living room with the two little girls i im a baby sitter then huh iche play with me car ry me i carry both of them and become lost at the current situation part 3 cat cute yeah it sure is cute i was outside while holding both their hands they take interest in anything that appears in front of us and they pulled me towards ever ywhere i was urged by them when they said i want to go outside so like that we went out so what did these two want to do after all for
now our destination is the convenience store in our neighborhood it felt like they would be satisfied if i buy them ice cream but even buchou who is a very noble onee sama is now a normal little girl even the quiet asia is now spoiled and disobedient but they are cute so its ok but i did think raising a child would be difficult ah its ise i hear d a familiar voice from another direction when i looked i saw my mates matsuda and motohama its summer holiday so were they heading towards my house from noon but i sure did meet up with annoying guys what are you doingwait children hey he y what are those little kids they both got shocked after seeing buchou and asia well obviously ddont tell me they are ises children judging from the hair colour they are from rias senpai and asia chan they started to guess something t hey came up with the conclusion of them being my children theres no way that i have kids i dont want to have kids when i didnt even do baby making i wanted to say that but stopped as i am living
with bishoujo i want to remain as the embodiment o f their jealousy i tried to make excuses but they continue with their delusion from their appearance they are about 3 or 4 years old ise is 17 right now right is it just possible then are you serious t that guy acted as if he doesnt have a ny experience and you are telling me he was laughing at us behind our backs matusda and motohama look at me while putting on a serious expression which i cant describe wawait a sec y you guys what are you calculating what are you guys imaginin g its an emergency meeting its me case d occurred its case d matsuda called somewhere after calling somewhere w where are you calling what is case d flash motohama takes a photo of mini buchou and mini asia heeeey what are you tak ing matsuda we have the proof now lets head towards the hall of ise extermination committee hell yeah ise prepare yourself after the meeting is over we are always wishing for your misfortune my mates leave this place really quickly i tried to call them back hey what do you mean
by extermination committee and wishing for my misfortune wait where are you guys going while leaving your best mate here die what i heard from afar is such a heartless word part 4 i think im a bit ex hausted i was dead tired inside the living room after coming back from the convenience store its cold yummy minibuchou and mini asia were eating their ice cream deliciously but this is a problem im scared that another weird rumour about me m ight start in my class after the summer holiday is over i was holding my head down and azazel sensei appeared in front of me i found the way to dispell it sensei was dressed up as an explorer he hands me a western style looking sword and steel shield huh what is this we will gather ingredients with the power of darkness within them there is a medicine which will dispell the spell on them by mixing those ingredients thats why ise lets get going azazel sensei points in a direction while enjo ying himself huh go to where i was full of suspicions and kiba comes in and explains we found the way to turn buchou
and asia san back to normal first we found the magic spell used from the trace of demonic power in your room and we are currentl y finding the way to dispell it by reading the spell backwards this was also mentioned in one of the documents sensei brought so it would be okay if akeno san or i am present its just a matter of time hmm i see so the spell used by buchou could be solved huh sensei then adds additional explanation that alone would be enough but we decided to make a medicine to dispell the spell as well but for that we need ingredients so you and i will be gathering them you say gathering ingredients but whe re are we going to various locations akeno you come as well if you and i go we can support ise akeno san put on an unpleasant face after being called by sensei akeno san doesnt seem to get along with sensei that well i dont feel satisfied by having you say that to me but this is all for buchou asia chan and ise kun i will go with you akeno san affirmed it while crossing
her arms oh her elbows are touching her breasts sensei how about me xenovia asks while dragging gasper gaspe rso you were being trained by her huh you train gasper roger now lets go gasper next we will train on how to dodge the wave of the holy sword durandal hiiiiiiii i will be vampire hunted for real this time xenovia leaves while dragging gasp er who had a pale white face xenovia you seem to be enjoying it gasper get stronger iche where are we going dont leave us buchou and asia pull the cuff of my trousers hmm what should i do well we will take them with us i will be comi ng as well so we wont get into that much of a dangerous situation certainly having the unbeatable governor sama will insure our safety like this we started to gather the ingredients by using the fallen angel style transport magic circle for longrange distance purposes it started but gaaaaaaaaaaaaao a dangerous roar is aimed at me in the depths of the mountain of some country i was confronting a massive monster while wielding a sword and shield the enemy is called a minotaur and is
a humanoid shaped monster with the head of a bull its about 4 to 5 meters tall and it is very big it has thick arms and chest it has a head of a bull but it has fangs it isnt a herbivore its definitely a carnivorous bull im the only one who is havi ng such a dangerous situation swing a sound vibrated through the air the battle axe that the minotaur has was bigger than me and it just swung that at me i will be killed if i get hit by that it will cut my body in half with one swing the first ing redient apparently that is minotaurs liver but it seems like my liver is the one which is being hunted hey ise go all out the one who said that is sensei who is preparing for a nabe15 sensei i will be killed there is no way i can take on this thing i scream and yell for help of course theres no way i can beat a bull monster with a sword like thissssss what are you saying show your love for rias and asia i will just watch over you with
warm eyes from here the governor sama says that while checking dashi16 for the p ot what the fuck are you doing you even took out a table and a set of stoves azazel sensei i have cut the ingredients oh akeno thanks we now have to wait for that idiot to beat the bull it would be okay if he gets its liver lets eat the other parts then i havent eaten minotaurs meat before the minotaur from around here taste amazing once you eat it you will get addicted to it i even think it is the same as matsusaka beef hey rias and asia here are your plates meat bullsan ooooooooi why are you guys having a situation like that of a family while im having a life and death situation right next to you im about to be killed by the so called matsusaka bull i was put in an absolute demise while avoiding the attacks from minotaur rias asia the butcher will be bringing the meat soon lucky you sensei the so called butcher is about to be killed i will be killed by the bull this bull is strong i will be killed before
i deliver the meat uwa the battle axe which came down makes a big hole on the ground i cant even stop a single one of those attacks help me even just a bit you are the governor of fallen angels so doesnt that make you something like a last boss of films and such yeah im strong if it s a rpg game i would be the hidden boss which appears after you have beaten the game and someone like that is your ally so you guys are really lucky then please help me i will get killed if i have to fight a monster by myself then that will be bo ring if i shoot out a beam from my hand and defeat the monster then the monster will be defeated in a few lines of a novel you know azazel released a light from his hand the bull died item received look it finished in a few lines its boring its okay to be boring governor sama who is a bazillion times stronger than me please have merccccccy while we were talking like that i can hear the earth rumbling from a far when i lookeda group
of minotaur are heading this way gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaa groups of matsusaka beef are heading this way did it come to help its kind after realising it was battling i will seriously get killed this time im going to be eaten by the bulls araara it came in a herd akeno san has a troubled face ne xt to her sensei put on a troublesome expression chi so noisy he points his finger to the herd pi a ray of light comes from his finger and dooooooooooooooon now while making a super big explosion the herd of minotaur and their surroundings we re blown away its so insane it certainly was an attack of a last boss hmph the burdens are now gone ise fight to your hearts content sensei puts his thumb up that isnt it that isnt what i mean if there were so many of them you can get as m any livers as you want he turned all of them into ashes he really did finish it in a few lines the beam just now can you shoot at least one of them this way the battle will end with that also among the herd just now
there were much bigger ones tha n the one i am battling just fight last boss sensei i might be lucky or unlucky the minotaur became scared from the attack just now i know how you feel scary right it would definitely be scary if someone like a last boss is amongst your enemy but i kept the sympathy inside me and went slashing at it thinking this was a chance part 5 i somehow obtained the minotaurs liver and we arrived in a different country in front of us was akeno san wearing a thin cloth is this okay the fascinating body stimulates me aaah like i thought akeno sans oppai are big the white thighs shown from the slit her beautiful legs are wonderful yeah unicorns only open up to pure virgins just like sensei said we came to get a unicorns horn this time w e are in a forest in front of a beautiful lake apparently unicorns appear before pure girls without any bit of filth like that akeno san was selected for this role and we are hiding in the shadows killing our breath while waiting for the unicorn to ap pear apparently that thin
cloth is something which keeps in the demonic power of a devil it was prepared by azazel sensei because he thought that unicorns might not approach a devil woman akeno san stood in front of the lake and we looked at her from t he shadows buchou and asia are sitting on my lap quietly yeah you two are good girls sensei then says quietly hmm it might be weird if its coming from me but i do think that akeno has quite the erotic body sensei says it while looking at akeno san seriously rather than looking at her lecherously it was a gaze of familial affection as if he is happy about the growth of his daughter or sister i agree why does she have such an erotic body akeno also carries the blood of fallen angels there are so many erotic fallen angel women are you for real certainly the fallen angel women i met before had erotic bodies yeah its one of their jobs to fascinate men from another kind their body becomes something which would be highly craved by me n but even if you compare them akeno is exceptional you if you can get
her then definitely take her wwell if i can then i definitely would yeah even if im like this i also have the role to watch over her i feel relieved after hearing y ou say that sensei started nodding by himself whats going on hhaa is that so iche you have a perverted face pevert im having my cheeks pulled by the two little girls it seems like they are mad what happened to these two little girl s uu please dont pull looks like you will have many difficulties oh it appeared when i looked a white skinned horse appeared near the lake it really does have a horn growing out if its head since ancient times a unicorn s horn has been heavily treasured as a medicine to cure everything it also has the effect to dispell a spell thats why we are going to take it is it okay will it grow back it wont be a problem since we will put medicine on it so it will have i ts horn growing back ah so even the after care is done properly the unicorn approaches akeno san the moment akeno sans hand touches it ha
akeno san karate chopped the unicorns neck because the unicorn had its guard down it fell down on the sp ot after confirming it we got out of the shadows im sorry unicorn even if she looks like this akeno san is a devil first it was a bull and now a horse maybe the next target is a pig that time i wasfoolish part 6 the ingredient we came for was the worst gobaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa right in front of me a monster which is more than 15 metres tall made a roar a red scaled monster which has both wings spreada dragon this is a flame dragon a dragon which represents fire the scal es growing from its back is the last ingredient we are looking for sensei explains calmly impossible its impossible no matter how you look at it this is a monster uwaaaaaah are matured dragons this big i have seen a baby dragon before asias f amiliar is a mini dragon he is so small that you can carry him and this guy isnt something you can carry a sword like this would be like a tooth pick against him s sensei this is a bit the
dragon which is residing in you is far stronger than this one show me that you can do something about it inside me i have the legendary dragonthe power of the sekiryuutei is residing in me its certainly true but i still cant use the power properly and it would be impossible for me to fight this g uy goooooooooooooooooooooooo the dragon released a humongous amount of fire from its gigantic mouth uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i could only just run around while crying i will be burnt black if i get hit by even one of those it will be hot seriously hot more like why am i having so many near death experiences today hey sensei if i think about it you and akeno san came with me today to support me right im sure he said that before we went around different places but until now i havent had any support yet before you saw akenos erotic appearance right yes of course i saved it into my brain with that our job is done seriouslyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy my eyes were about to pop out because of what i was just told for real thats it i w as happy and it was
certainly wonderful but sensei its too cruel no matter how i think about it akeno san argues aaah to be expected from akeno san shes so kind who cares you also want to see the cool side of ise right t that is cert ainly true but huh akeno san is going to be convinced with that i was dodging the dragons fire breath and tail whip while being shocked about it but you will need strength even to dodge crap im losing my breath sensei i will be killed my sta mina wont laaaaaaaaaaaaast maybe my desperate pleading reached him so sensei said fine then while shaking his head to the side it cant be helped come ouuuuuuut azazel sensei clicks his fingers and a gigantic magic circle appears on the ground something very big appears from it while emitting black pulses what the heck is thiiiiiiis what appeared from the magic circle is a humanoid type super robot which is the same size as the dragon wait a robot my view of the world changed where di d it come from outer space from the secret basement located under kuou academys pool thats the promised setting right sensei
says it while making a wink dont customise our school like you want so he was making a thing like this below the po ol we swim in if buchou who is the shadow ruler of the school finds out about this she will snap this is a devil helping robot and i created it using fallen angels technology its the maouga17 i was asked by sirzechs its powered by the hatred of humans which is flowing within the whole world hatred is overflowing in this world so this is ecology sensei who was standing on the robots s houlder gives an explanation like that mamaougaaaaaaaaaaaaaa its definitely from a different series it came out in the wrong story more like what do you mean by the hatred being its energy its evil no matter how you think about it it is a weapon used by villains why did sirzechs sama ask you to make such a thing why did he have to ask this evil governor of all people small details are unnecessary whats important is the flow and how you do things lets go maouga absorb the hate of p eople you are the master piece created by
this world of darkness maouga aims its arm at the dragon like i thought your imagination is evil sensei eat this rocket punch when sensei shouted baaaaaaaaaaaaaaang the arm had fire coming from it a nd it was released forward it really is a rocket punch gooooooooooooooo the rocket punch which went ahead very fast was easily dodged by the dragon and disappeared to the other side of the sky huh this is it more importantly sensei u umm i just want to ask you something what tthe rocket punch which went flying will it not come back sensei closes his eyes for a while at my question like this the hatred in the world disappeared he replied back with a refreshing s mile i dont understand what you mean wait the rocket punch is continuing to fly that isnt ecology where did the rocket punch fly off to dont tell me it hit a country somewhere aaaaah to the people living in that country im sorry for the f act that a gigantic fist suddenly came flying how sad after all robots are just weapons sirzechs can you hear me how many more times do we have to taint
our hands in evil to escape from this way of life dont say something like that with suc h a sad expression by the way i will ask you this just in case but which is stronger between maouga and sensei of course its me sensei pointed at himself confidently then dont make it its a waste of money you alone would be stronger even just by firing a beam there are even days for me when i cant use beams you used it just before while sensei and i were arguing the dragon tried to assault us while making a roar gaaaaaao shut up piii a light came from the snapped senseis han d dooooooon a monster sized dragon fell on the ground from just a single hit look i wasnt needed after all maouga also wasnt needed hmph theres no way that a mere wild dragon can even lay a finger on me like this thanks to our no thanks to sensei the ingredients were all gathered seriously it would have been enough if it was just sensei alone but why am i in this worn out state part 7 i was somehow able to return home we
gathered the ingredients i was tired in both my body and soul how many times did i think i was going to die today from what i heard buchou and asia performed a ceremony in my room which failed and they were turned into little girls as a result this time to do something opposite of that ceremony it was deci ded to do the spell where the spell they used was activated we made buchou and asia sit in the centre of a dispell magic circle and we had them drink the fluid which had the ingredients we gathered crushed in it bitter ueeeen both of them drank th e fluid while having teary eyes now whats left is for me to activate the spell and return both of them back to normal akeno san sent her demonic powers to the magic circle and the magic circle glowed oh so with this buchou and asia will revert ba ck to normal it felt very long indeed i took a breath and sensei talked to me hey ise yeah what would you do if you could only revert one of them back to normal due to the medicine and solution
for dispelling he questioned me i didnt thi nk about anything and answered him immediately i will double it with the boosted gear and make it twice as strong for both of them hearing that sensei laughs hahahaha so you answer like that without thinking good answer yeah thats exactly righ t you are capable of doing that if you are a legendary dragon then you can save both of them i was confused but its the truth that i will save both of them no matter what hiiiiiiiiiii ise senpai please save meeeeeeee im going to be killed by xenovia senpai the one who suddenly entered the room was gasper it seems like he was being chased around by xenovia mu dont run im just telling you to drink a nutrient juice with lots of garlic inside xenovia came chasing after gasper while holding a cup of creepy coloured juice wait gasper is running this way isesenpai save meeeeeee hhes going to crash into me don i get pushed back to the magic circle with the tackle from gasper and xenovia flash the magic circle glowed an d it releases a single flash after that the ones who appear
at the centre of the magic circle are the usual buchou and asia looks like we were able to revert back to normal auuu im back to normal im glad both of them are back to their usual selves buchou with big oppai and the adorable asia so why did this happen sensei asks them buchou and asia looked at each other shyly and then tell us for quite some time asia and i were very interested about ise when he was a child and the re was a spell which could turn a person into a child temporarily you tried it and the spell rebounded huh geez sensei made a sigh as if he was astonished buchou and asia put on an apologetic expression wait so they were trying to make me into a kid huh ah if i remember correctly both of them went crazy when they saw the old album with photos of me so thats why im sorry im sorry both of them bow their head down its okay im glad both of you are back i replied with a smile ise we still have our memory from when we were turned into children yes ise
san treated us very importantly you worked so hard for us until you were beaten down that much i was happy arara it seems like they are looking at me with soggy e yes if they act like that i will feel embarrassed instead huh is it me or are buchou and asia bigger now and the surroundings are bigger was everyone this big i was troubled with how to react and sensei says to me with a smile so this time it i s your turn huh hahahaha you are tiny huh i made a dumbfounded sound i started to feel uneasy and looked at my hand andthey are small i looked into the mirror inside the room and what reflects is me in the form of a child whaaaaaaaaat is t hisssssssss i screamed and sensei says with a mischievous smile just now when you were pushed into the magic circle it seems like a weird spell was activated eeeeeeeeeeeeh so this time its me but i still have my memory it looks like the spell worked on you properly you are lucky rias asia all the club members put on a expression of joy when they heard
sensei iyaaan ise you are cute like i thought buchou hugs me tightly im not a doll so you shouldnt be saying iyaaan bub uchou san please let me hug him as well ara ara then please allow me after asia chan it seems like asia and akeno san are deeply emotional as well their eyes are sparkling ise i think you are cute as well ii also feel the same way xenovi a and gasper who were the culprits say that timidly while putting their hands up apologise apologise to me this instant if im this small then i wont be able to go outside how can i tell this to mum and dad its a big problem then you should be a lright in that state for a while it seems like rias asia and akeno are happy as well no one is unfortunate in this sensei says something horrible it seems like i will be super unfortunate wait what about those ingredients theres none left sensei answers with a mischievous smile what how can you be so heartless sensei please go and get the ingredients you can do that immediately with your power right dont wan na
i already had plenty of fun today you just endure being in that stat e for a while im leaving sensei is really horrible he definitely worked today to have fun i just ended up being unfortunate today then i will be leaving now i also have to do my research project so i will be leaving as well kiba and koneko chan are also going home what is this this is just a sad story about me now no i dont want this someone save meeeeeee our summer holiday just started but its scary because it seems like i am the only one who will be unfortunate life6 300 ise part 1 right now im inside a mysterious capsule hahahaha seriously you came in at a good time ise the one activating the device while laughing cheerfully is azazel sensei when i entered senseis laboratory bringing tea i was thrown i n here when he said oh good timing i dont understand bang bang even if i bang from inside the capsule it wont even budge what are you trying to do sensei well there was something i wanted to try for a bit and i was troubled because
i didn t have a test subject and you happened to come by to bring tea so i just felt like it you felt like it so you decided to throw your student inside because you felt like it everything comes with a sacrifice eh its determined that im to be sacrificed no let me out nooooooo i beg for help but the device is activated there is an identical capsule next to this one but nothing is inside so im the only one inside the capsule wait what kind of experiment is this when sensei tur ned around at my question and tried to answer flash dooooooooon a single flash and explosion occurred cough cough uu so much smoke i was released from the capsule without realising it when i looked the capsule i was inside is broken did it explode because the experiment failed the room was messed up because of the explosion and so many things are broken when i look around the room sensei is no where to be seen he must have got bored because his experiment failed i wanted to make a compl aint to him he is a disgrace to teachers since he
used his student as his test subject just to be expected from the boss of the fallen angels he sure has an evil way of thinking geez that azazel sensei he just left me after his experiment ended i left senseis laboratory after saying that the place i am currently in is the old school building of kuou academy while heading to the club room kyaa the voice of a girl this voice belongs to asia when i headed towards where the scream came from there was asia fully naked buu i got a strong nosebleed hmm like i thought asia chan sure did develop quite a lot since i first met her your brother is so happy you are h horrible ise san for you to suddenly tear my clothes asia complains to me with teary eyes eh i was told something from asia which i have no knowledge of i certainly do have a move limited to girls which blows the clothes of those i touch called dress break but there is no way i would use it against asia and i dont re member using it now hey stop right there ise this time its xenovias voice
who seems to be chasing someone i looked wondering what was going on andi saw myself coming from the corner wait why am i in front of me the guy who looks like me had a lecherous face while having a nosebleed and he disappeared somewhere after going passed me and asia xenovia who is chasing him then appears wait xenovia is also naked she is holding a weapon in her hand after looking around she caught me with h er gaze and came at me closing in while having her oppai shake and thats while she is holding the holy sword devils will die if slain by a holy sword what is the meaning of not doing anything to me when you have stripped me naked you are angry for that reason xenovia who i can never understand tries to assault me stop right there both of you a sudden voice xenovia stops her hand and the holy sword stops right in front of me when i turned around akeno san was standing there she came bring ing azazel sensei and someone who looks just like me part 2 the whole academy is filled with ise an emergency meeting
of the occult research club buchou puts her hand on her forehead and said it while making a sigh all the club members stood at the s ide of the window and we were looking at the situation of the new school building through binoculars there are so many of me there are mes throughout the school and they are chasing after the girls who still remained on campus even after school ended and they were using dress break on the girls the groups of ise are going around making the girls from this school naked buchou who is next to me put on a troubled face koneko chan gave strong intensity by breaking the binoculars i was assaulted by them when i was on my way here i didnt understand the situation then but i beat it up hiiiiiiiii scary koneko sama is mad but i dont remember doing that more like what are all those mes what should we do with this one here that we caught earlier akeno san looked at the corner of the room there was a cage and there is someone who looks just like me inside it this one is the one who
made asia chan and xenovia chan naked akeno san tries to touch my look alike who is inside the cage please show me your oppai oppai he said while putting on a lecherous face and is trying to assault akeno san wow they are dangerous be careful you guys especially the girls ises copies have stronger sexual desire than the original azazel sensei said tthen this ise san destroyed our clothes i see maybe it does have a more lecherous face than usual asia and xenovia who changed into new uniforms were looking at my copy with keen eyes im happy that the misunderstanding of me stripping them got through to them i wouldnt dare to use dress break on asia whom i adore as my little sister nor xenovia whom i still cant come to understand wwell there was certainly a time when i accidentally blew away asias clothing in the past hey az azel what were you trying to do in the experiment buchou asks azazel sensei well the doppelgnger went crazy while i was experimenting on it so ises copies increased though i activated the barrier around the academy immediately so ises doppelg ngers wouldnt be able
to escape from here i made sure the damage would be suppressed sensei who is sitting on the sofa says that eh you did such a thing for that experiment more like what is a doppelgnger akeno san answers my question doppe lgnger has the meaning of counterpart of a living person and it is a phenomenon where your copy appears in front of you then those are my copies i multiplied during the experiment hahaha ise came into my room at a good time so i felt like it it would have been enough if i was able to make one copy of him but i made a mistake then ises doppelgngers which had ises sexual desire enhanced were mass produced hahahaha man was i scared so you say that the number of ises increased but ex actly how many of them are there buchou asks sensei while putting her hand to her forehead and making a sigh roughly 300 300 everyone became shocked at senseis confession of course im shocked that there are about 300 of my copies noazazel sensei do you understand what you have done are you trying to take this academy down to the depths
of darkness ise kun isnt any ordinary hentai you know kiba is really mad and you dont see that often yeah i think he just said something rude ab out me its a nightmare that the number of super perverts increased koneko chan also says that while shivering with rage i can also feel the murderous intent towards me as well eh its my fault hiiiiiiii for there to be 300 ise senpai i ii will be stripped gasper screams from inside the cardboard fuck off i would never strip a guy naked even by mistake i would like to have at least one of them but it would be no good if it is ise kun who is just lecherous like i thought the real on e is definitely the best akeno san hugs me the sensation of her huge oppai as to be expected from akeno san she sure understands me you are right anyway we need to do something about it buchou says it while pinching my cheek it hurts onee sama kiba then tells us after he spoke to someone over his mobile phone there has already been damage caused to the academy the majority of
the girls who remained at school have received dress break and their clothing was blown away the student council the sitri group are also getting rid of ise kun but most of the student council are girls so they are having a hard time the student council are also devils like us so they were communicating with kiba huh more than that im very sorry for causing t rouble sona kaichou saji im sorry bin azazel sensei created a small magic circle in front of him and he moves his fingers as if hes using a touch panel then flash it felt like a very bright flash covered the whole academy sensei then says aft er the light stops anyway i made the remaining students go to sleep by force so the casualties wont expand anymore than this on top of that i put a barrier over the girls so ise wont be able to go near them so with this ise wont be able to do nau ghty things to the sleeping girls seriously amazing he did all that with that single flash the power of the governor of the fallen angels has no limit terrific sensei receives applause
and compliments from the girls what is this weird feeling i have right now this isnt about me yet it feels like im being blamed for it sensei got up and then told everyone whats left is to eliminate ise they should disappear like smoke if they receive damage i know he isnt saying it to me but it feel s like i am being treated like a pest when he said eliminate well 300 ises are the same as pests we need to exterminate them you said something i had in my mind you are horrible sensei to begin with you are the cause of all this its eno ugh with just one ise yes buchou it will cause damage if there are many of them lets take down all of them buchou and kiba are really eager to do this indeed the enemies of women the worst phenomenon you can imagine we need to take them down bun koneko chan is really motivated to do this and she thrust her fist forward the super human girl who is usually emotionless is eager to do this everyone seems like they dont care what sensei has done and they are
more focused on taking down my copies you guys are horrible im the one who became the victim of all this im going to cry okay you guys we will think of a plan dont look down on the technology of fallen angels yes like this the plan to defeat my doppelgngers started part 3 using the doppelgnger we caught before a strategy was designed doppelgnger says i feel calm when i look at o oppai give me o oppai he says something like a zombie that appeared in the zombie film dad showed me a long time ago but this is worse than i thought are you telling me that these guys have a deficiency disease towards oppai or something like that a strategy was made strategy 1 fishing first you have to prepare the fishing rod and it will be completed if you use the porno mag as bait azazel sensei gave out the fishing rods that have a porno magazine as bait apparently we have to lure it out from the window of the clubroom and wait till we catch my doppelgnger the offence team which will be eliminating the doppelgnge rs caught are stationed below im
also one of them and nno is it really okay for the strategy to be this simple i became dubious wait this is the power of the fallen angels science technology this is something not only capable of junior school ers but also nursery children as well no matter how lecherous i am im not so dumb as to jump into something so dangerous porno porno magazine let me read it its mine there are so many doppelgngers th at are being caught by the fishing rods used by the club members i was so shocked by what i was currently witnessing that my eyes were about to pop out eeeeeeh is this really okay doppelgngers ssensei they are biting at every cast kiba who is fishing seems very shocked at how much it worked don go koneko chan who is beating and eliminating every doppelgnger caught we have caught so many that it scares me yes it is im also surprised as well koneko chan but there are groups of ise senpai who are looking at the situation from the shadows gasper points at the doppelgngers hiding in the shadows so there are also copies of me who are
cautious use a manic porno magazine for those guys they will come out sensei changes gaspers bait no i dont think that will but even my thinking like that was yyou are right amazing asia pulled the doppelgnger using a rare type of porno magazine asia seems like shes having a bit of fun even though she is shocked asia chan are yo u enjoying fishing using the porno magazines as bait hentai eliminated don gon my adorable junior is continuing to beat up my doppelgngers without mercy even here buun the super human strengthened girls fist even comes flying this way she cant see the difference between me and the doppelgngers gosu gough i received a hit to my stomach and that was a precise hit ko koneko chan im the real one i wont be fooled the real one has an even more lecherous face how can this be how does she look at me usually koneko it seems like that ise is the real one he wont disappear even if he received an attack koneko chan realised it after xenovia who is also in the offence group supported my claim uuu it must b e an unlucky
day for me today because of the fishing strategy half of the doppelgngers have been dealt with my mixed feelings have yet to disappear strategy 2 seduction it was decided that we needed a second strategy looks like they wont be ca ught with fishing anymore looks like even ise started gaining a brain yeah azazel sensei just said something quite horrible sensei calls akeno san akeno being called by sensei the happy faced akeno san puts on an unpleasant expression thats bec ause akeno san doesnt get along with sensei what is it i have a plan your power is required for it i feel unsatisfied hearing that its your plan but i will listen to what you have to say sensei whispers into akeno sans ear hearing that akeno san puts on a complicated expression c certainly that might work i want to use rias but she would be better as a last resort its you first u understood akeno san approved senseis suggestion huh what did they talk about akeno san used the power of devils demonic powers to make what looks like a changing room appear in the corner of the room and went inside it
is she going to get changed when i was thinking like that akeno san wearing a bunny suit came ouuuuuuuut the tig hts which are wrapping around her beautiful thighs the erotic bunny suit which is suppressing her breasts and it makes it perfect by her wearing bunny ears akeno san already has an erotic body to begin with and having her in a bunny suit has impact bey ond any imagination hey look even the real one has that reaction this will have an insane effect you know sensei laughs looking at me since i had my eyes taken away by akeno san thats because it would be impossible not to be excited looking at ake nosan in a bunny suit akeno san then says it loudly after leaving the old school building isekun its your oppai here a moment of silence and right after that oppai the doppelgngers who didnt come out during the fishing came out at once you guys where were you hiding give me oppai mine its my oppai oppai all of them were saying naughty things but their expressions are serious how much do you guys crave for oppai no i m also craving
for it all the time as well the moment the doppelgngers try to attack akeno san flash dooooooooooooooooooooooon the lightning flashed and it envelops the doppelgngers oh its akeno sans lightning attack which she specialises in t he doppelgngers disappear immediately the effect is big they dont feel a thing about being eliminated and just try to jump at akeno sans oppai seeing a situation where theyre jumping to meet their doom the original me cant stop tears from flowing out what are you guys doing the akeno san bunny strategy seems like its working i became heartless and i felt empty inside hey my doppelgngers are you guys happy having akeno sans breasts in front of them they ran with all their might putt ing their hopes on the line and they were eliminated heartlessly araara if this was the real ise kun i would have been happy i would have given service in this bunny costume im very sorry ise kuns doppelgngers even i was moved by akeno sans charming words that i want to jump into her arms but i controlled myself sensei walks next to me nodding his head and putting his hand on my shoulder
his expression was that of sadness but he is carrying a handycam can i send this video to my co workers afterwards this is too hilarious i think that i wouldnt be blamed even if i hit you sensei and i began beating each other on the spot i made a phrase my self jumping into a fire of flashing lightning by hyoudou issei strategy 3 govern or of fallen angels threat there were half of the doppelgngers left before akeno sans bunny girl strategy but the number of them decreased drastically and there is less than ten of them left so the strategy went into the last phase fuhaha foolish i se azazel sensei who is standing on the roof of the old school building he is wearing the costumes worn by the boss of an evil organisation he has twelve black fallen angel wings growing out from his back and he looks exactly like the boss of an enemy he then screams to my doppelgngers who are still hiding somewhere look at this buchou who is wearing a dress appears next to sensei she is in a princess in hostage mode well you are a real princess after
all so you look beautiful in a dress this is the last strategy using buchou who is my master as hostage to lure out the doppelgngers if buchou was to be taken by the boss of all evil then i would rescue her with my life she is my master and more than that she is the woman i love either wa y it is senseis plan to use my love towards my master how evil to be expected from the boss of the fallen angel organisation kya ise help me but buchou doesnt seem like she is that eager about this even her speech is too obvious well this does seem quite stupid seeing that sensei sighs hey rias scream by putting more feeling into it its so obvious you are acting that even i dont feel like continuing this even if you say that to begin with will ises doppelgngers really come o ut with something like this its just like buchou said and the remaining doppelgngers dont show any signs of movement you are right at this rate they wont so i have an idea sensei takes a big breath listen im going to grope riass breasts
n owwwww if you dont want that then come out and rescue her fuhahahahahahahahaha he screamed something foolish like that heeeeeeeeey groping buchous oppai you say i didnt hear that you would go that far for this plan no its just an act but th ere are things you should never do ku what an evil plan to take my buchous oppai as hostage i lifted my fist up while feeling angered and koneko chan made a sigh next to me what a lowly strategy its just like you say koneko sama sensei then continues to tell the doppelgngers if you dont come out before i count to ten then im going to grab onto riass breasts you hear grabbing it im going to do something in front of you which even you havent done yet he moves all his five f ingers lecherously you are in high spirits buchou made a sigh while having her eyes half closed hahahaha i dont have the job of a last boss like occupation for nothing leave these things to me okay then even i will also have to put on some a cting then buchou made a single sigh of determination kyaa
ise save me she begs for help with a cute voice my heart skipped a beat at when buchou screamed out kyaa buchou hearing that voice my doppelgngers show themselves from behind the shadows oh the doppelgngers have a serious expression even if they are the doppelgngers which only show a strong desire for sex it seems like their love for buchou is very strong too i was emotionally moved a bit after learning that look the remaining idiots came out just to be expected from my plan you saw that you guys this is the power of fallen angels science how is this science power but is the reason why it sounds so convincing is because sensei is someone amazing pii sensei released a beam from his fingers without any mercy and starts to attack my doppelgngers doooooooooooooon creating a huge explosion a few doppelgngers were blown away like always it sure has insane power it scares me because it has that much power while he is holding back he continues to shoot his lights towards the doppelgngers rising up towards his attack i felt chills on my back when i think about myself in that situation but sensei
laughs heartily observe ises are like trash now he is enjoying it very much hey azazel hold back a bit you do know that we are the ones who have to fix the damage right maybe i should ask for the fallen angels to pay for it buchou also put on an astonished face hahahaha dont say that rias this is fun while they were having a conversation like that the last remaining doppelgnger was trying to stand up with its wounded body after being blown away by the explosion and is heading for sensei it seems like that doppelgnger san is de sperate asia who is next to me says that while being worried about it iit certainly doesnt seem like we can ignore that that doppelgnger shouts while being wounded im going to rescue buchou i had my heart shaken by those words yeah you a re right by the time i realised it i had taken that doppelgngers hand the doppelgnger looks at me suspiciously lets go to begin with this is all senseis fault we will save buchou together yeah it all turned out like this because of sensei i was about to forget something i
shouldnt have the doppelgnger and i shook hands and we connected hehehe we sure are alike lets gooooooo yeaaaaaah the doppelgnger and i ran towards sensei yeah the source of all of this is that fallen angel over there if we dont beat him then this academy will not become peaceful iwe finally realised that arere those guys teamed up all of a sudden man it cant be helped then pii sensei releases the light from his finger without any mercy doooo ooooooooooon the doppelgnger and i barely dodged that we cant stop in a place like this that guy we need to eliminate that last boss sensei mu you dodged that huh hows this then pii pii pii continuous shots of light explosion happened everywhere and we still continued to charge forward towards that evil boss while being surrounded by explosions just like a tokusatsu hero at times one would fall so the other one would help out and stand up and charge forward once again but he shoot s his light laser heartlessly ga but the light laser deflects right in front of me and was shot elsewhere the ones who deflected the light laser werekiba and xenovia
who are wielding their swords both of them then say it while smiling i dont k now why but my body moved by itself yeah just like kiba it happened to me too i thought i have to act when i saw you guys paaaaa a gentle light green light envelops me and the doppelgnger the wounds get healed immediately and my body feels ligh ter its asia asia who has a healing ability healed me and the doppelgnger when i watched both of you i felt something warm welling up within me asia says that yeah if asia is with us i have 100 times more courage than before yes if i thin k about it very carefully azazel sensei is the main cause of this no matter how i think about it akeno san also came to our aid i think it might be good for sensei to receive some punishment at times i dont know what is going on but i will also cooperate koneko chan and gasper came to our side as well it seems like doppelgnger and i lit a fire inside everyone hehehe man geez they are all a bunch of kind guys it
cant be helped since we are comrades after all now lets go forward to defeat sensei yeah we realised who the true evil is and we retrieved our bond once again and then we ran towards sensei no towards the evil governor azazel you are the most evil one after all seeing that sensei gets so shocked that his eye s were about to pop out arara those guys teamed up well it might be good for you to receive such punishment at times you are basically doing evil deeds anyway buchou also nods her head aabsurd sensei becomes very astonished because it seem s like something he didnt anticipate happened he spread his black wings but we arrived at the roof top and grabbed his legs before he could fly away of all people i in a place like this gyaaaaaaaaaaaa a scream which sounds like it is coming f rom the last boss when it meets its doom we managed to capture sensei chi everyone ganging up on me and bullying me sensei who has many bandages on his face says it while his eyes were half opened and had tears coming out from them what are you
sa ying you do know this is all your fault right akeno san is also making a bitter smile exactly you should reflect on your actions a bit okay sensei ngggh having even buchou tell him off sensei seems like he cant talk back after he was captur ed he received punishment from us well i think it is right to do this at times more like this incident all started because of senseis whim ah it seems like senpais doppelgnger is about to disappear i turned around to the doppelgnger after hear ing gaspers voice andi saw my copy who just fought alongside me about to disappear i silently gave him a salute he also responded and saluted back to me we only fought alongside each other for a short time but we were definitely comrades and then m y doppelgnger disappeared his expression was that of satisfaction because of successfully capturing sensei i also think he did a good deed in the end as well and it was decided that the girls who were stripped naked by my doppelgngers would have their memories erased by using azazel senseis power thats good with this rumours of me stripping the
girls naked would dissapea no if i erase it completely it would leave many bad effects on their memories so i just erased the facts about the doppel gngers in other words their memories of having their clothes blown away by ise would still remain sensei says he what do you mean by that i was in doubts and kiba points his finger downward this is bad many girls are making their way towa rds the old school building wwhaaaaaaaaaaaat i peek down from the rooftop of the old school building immediately and then ah its hyoudou hey hentai you have some nerve stripping us naked come down here i will kill you for being tar nished by you i will beat you to a pulp so everyone woke up since senseis technique wore off crowds of girls who had their clothes blown off had their eyes glittering with killing intent im going to be killed hahaha sorry ise i will treat you t o some food next time so try to overcome this somehow sensei leaves after laughing lightly h he ran away that damn shitty fallen angel sensei lift my body felt unnatural wait im being lifted up
by koneko chan at this rate it will cause troubl e to the rest of us so please solve this problem using your body throw i get thrown towards the crowd of girls with killing intent by my cute kouhai catch i am caught by several athletic girls and got dropped down in the middle of the crowd me who is surrounded by girls in a way it is a harem but there is no such beautiful atmosphere here i get glared at by everyone intensely while silent everyone was filled with hostility and killing intent i try to run away immediately im de finitely going to be killed dont run away hyoudouuuuu the girls come after me at once uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan senseeeeeeei where are you shit i wont be satisfied unless i take you down with meeeeeeee i searched for sensei while crying out loudly extra life the fun family of the gremory part 1 on a certain day off since morning buchou has had a stern look this is terrible unlike usual buchou is in a panic she is walking from my room to the first floor and then keeps on coming back rias oneesama is acting very weird
asia who is sitting next to me is looking at buchou with a worried face just like asia said buchou is acting weird she suddenly starts to clean the house and keeps on fixing her appearance every 10 minutes we just finished the intense battle with the evil god loki we the 2nd years are going to kyoto as a field trip soon its about time that us the 2nd years have to go to the department store nearby for shopping but right now im concerned about buch ou buchou did something happen when i asked her with a doubtful voice she answers me with a serious face onee sama is coming onee sama oh you mean grayfia san she nods quietly when i said that grayfia san the maid from buchous house she is deeply connected to finance matters and other things of the house of gremory which is a noble household of high class devils and she is the servant of maou and also the wife of buchous brother in other words she is buchous sister inlaw but buchou has been calling grayfia san grayfia but why is she calling her onee sama today i was in doubt
and akeno san tells me today grayfia san has a day off hmm a day off so she has a day off as a maid yes usually she is a maid who serves the house of gremory she has the relationship of servant and master with rias who is the daughter from the house of gremory but it seems like its a different story when she gets a day off only then she becomes riass sister inlaw buchou is scared of grayfia san who becomes her sister inlaw it seems like she is really strict koneko chan says i see so buchou also has someone she is weak against xenovia nodded with confirmation well even if buchou is the next heir of the noble house of grem ory she is still a girl so grayfia san who isnt a maid gets into a sister mode i do want to see the scenery where rias and grayfia san are acting like sisters the conversation between two beauties would look beautiful even if i were to look at them from the sidesbut i think something is going to happen by looking at how buchou is feeling nervous so she decided to visit
my house when she got a day off akeno san makes a small laugh at my words and answers me yes it seems like there is somethi ng she wants to talk to rias about as her sister buchou who is beside me and akeno san who are talking to each other is checking the room buchou even if you clean more than this nothing is coming out ii also need to prepare tea as well ise i wan t you to dress nicely as well she will probably check you as well buchou fixes my collar shes also checking my hair im getting checked as well umm why is that you are she stops there and her face becomes really red bebecause you a re special im special im not sure but is it because im the resident of the place she is home staying at or is it because i underwent lots of training when i went to the underworld in summer we went to the homeland of devils in summer and st ayed at buchous house especially i who was doing different things from other members like learning how to dance and learning the history of buchous
house even now its still a mystery why i did all those things even all the servants of the house of g remory call me waka18 it happened when i was bending my neck ping pong the door bell rang well by looking at how buchou is behaving i can imagine who the visitor is buchou went down quickly and headed for the main entrance we also looked at each other and walked towards the entrance the one who appeared from the entrance was a beautiful silver haired woman with clothes like a celebri ty i recognise her the clothes and hairstyle are different than usual but its grayfia san the maid she looks beautiful today because she is wearing clothes that look like they are from an expensive brand and she has her hair put up uwaa the usua l grayfia san who is in the maid outfit is beautiful but grayfia san today has the charm of an adult usually grayfia san appears in front of us by using the magic circle but today she came from the entrance so she must have wanted to visit here properly as a sister inlaw i can see a gorgeous limousine
parked outside wow thats the wife of maou for you grayfia san looks at us then greets us while having a smile filled with elegance how are you doing everyone then grayfia san looks at buchou gray fiasan then greets buchou with a cheerful smile how do you do rias hello onee sama buchou replies back with a smile but i can see that she is nervous it has been a while hime sama another voice when i looked at the direction where the voice ca me from there was a strange creature the face looked like an asian dragon it seems like a dragon and it had red scales throughout its body but the torso looks like either a horse or deer the size is about 2 metres i think either way its a creature i am seeing for the first time i mean was this the one that spoke it seems like it realised i was looking at it and the creature bows its head down to me oh if it isnt sekiryuutei dono this is our first meeting im a pawn that serves sirzechs sama and my name is enku pleased to make your acquaintance it spoke
and it has a polite speech and greeted me ha yeah nice to meet you too i also greeted him then the voice earlier was this guy called enku after all wait he serves sirzechs sama then ise he is enku he is a kirin which is a legendary creature and is onii samas servant its been a while enku im glad that you look healthy buchou pats enku the kirins neck with her hand so its the kirin that doesnt have a long neck19 even i know its name i dont know the details about it but its the one that appears in chinese folklore but sirzechs sama has a legend ary creature as his servant it said that it is a pawn but it definitely isnt worth only 1 or 2 pieces even if it is a same pawn as me he seems like he is in a different league as me the kirin enku san then says it to grayfia san then gra yfiasama i will be returning to my station yes thank you for escorting me till here enku it would have been fine by myself though what are you saying our great queen who is
also the wife of our master for you to go and visit someone officia lly without an escort well even though i say that i dont even have a slight thought of grayfia sama being in danger even without my escort i thought i should bring fortune to sekiryuutei donos residence by coming along with you more than that im glad to see the face of hime sama and sekiryuutei dono who is the waka i see officially visiting here as sirzechs samas wife and buchous sister inlaw is a serious matter wait waka again where does my position stand but what does he mean by fo rtune i was in doubt and akeno san whispers to my ear kirin is said to bring great fortune its said that if it visits a house something good will happen to that house hmm thats good im grateful i hope something good happens to my house by the way sirzechs sama is the only person among the devils who was able to make a sacred creature into his servant originally the two sides have relationships that are mutually exclusive making that possible makes sirzechs sama belong to a different leagu e compared
to others akeno san gave me additional information are you serious sirzechs sama is in a different league just like i thought enku you could stay even for a while buchou seems sad hahaha those words alone are enough for this enku even i have lots of duties as a servant of sirzechs sama i must accomplish that when i return to the underworld but hime sama i would like to run at the mountain with you again while carrying you on my back like before now i shall leave im hoping to meet all of you again enku san turned into a red mist and disappeared after saying that when i was living in the underworld enku became the one i could talk to he carried me on his back often buchou says it to me while smiling i see enku san i s also one of those who watched over buchou growing up buchou is immersed in her memory but grayfia san does a single cough buchou then had a nervous face again confirming that grayfia san asks now lets make the greetings short may i come into the house then like this grayfia san came to visit
my house as buchous sister inlaw i see im relieved that rias isnt causing trouble im here like this thanks to rias oneesama the conversation between asia and grayfia san grayfia san certainly is having a friendly chat with the members that are staying at my house in the living room buchou who is next to me has a smile on but she looks stiff some of the people living here were gathered asia akeno san koneko chan xenovia and irina are sitt ing around the table by the way my parents are away today because they went somewhere far rias is a bit selfish so i was worried that she was troubling everyone in the group that definitely isnt the case rias is acting as our leader staying here as a home stay and is looking after us very well akeno san smiles by lifting up buchous position to be expected from her friend rias is a fortunate person to be blessed with good friends and kouhai grayfia san smiles that smile seems as if she is t ruly happy but she then put on a strict face and looked at buchouand me whwhy me whats left isthe gentleman
piri after grayfia san said that the atmosphere in the room froze immediately iis it perhaps is that what this is about asia who was smiling until just now has a nervous face that must be it since grayfia san came here officially it must be part of it akeno san also has a pressured face along with her smile i did think that this day would come the loli loli koneko chan who usually had an expressionless face has a stern look xenovia and irina looked like they didnt know what is going on to tell you the truth even i dont know whats going on why did the girls atmosphere change at grayfia sans words the complex heart of girls i dont understand kiba and gasper didnt come here today buchou told them that it would be enough with just the members here rossweisse san went out since early morning to buy furniture and such so she can start living at my house it seems like that person is the type who uses money very carefully then buchou says to grayfia san while putting on a red face oonee sama did you come here for that matter i
thought that you left it to me so i could make it go naturally ara rias did okaa sama and i ever say that even once you broke it off before so isnt it your duty as the next heir to make us feel relieved it seems like buchou couldnt talk back to grayfia san who is simply talking she probably thinks that she shouldnt anger grayfia san who came here as her sister but breaking it off does she mean about breaking off the engagement with her former fiance riser that became a serious incident for the house of gremory and other people from other houses started talking behind their back that the selfish princess from the gremory broke off the engagement for devils in the noble society that take care of status and pureblood the engagement between households is important it seems like the freedom of love is something that is very strict for those children from the high class devils it seems like noble society is complex well it ended by me breaking into the engagement party beating up riser and taking buchou with me even so buchous parents forgave her about breaking off the engagement the
devils are said to have a dangerous birth rate we especially cant cut off the bloods of the noble family one day we would like you to be the parent of children of the next generation that is what otou sama okaa sama i and that person wish for grayfia san said it to buchou with a serious face then grayfia san softened her expression and made a bitter smile though i say that i was also involved in that incident i helped you even before that that person and i also had our own share of free romance that time we were in a situation that was more complicated than you are the love romance between you two is like a legend to female devils akeno san says it while her cheeks are red hmm im not sure but it seems like grayfia san also had an amazing romance as well well it seems like its obvious since her lover is a maou its also turned into a play koneko chan says a play wow im very interested in it asia als o seems like she is very interested in it girls cant resist a love story grayfia san
made a single cough while looking a bit embarrassed and changes her expression cough since there was the incident with us i ended up siding with you i want you to become a splendid high class devil lady i want you to have a strong self consciousness as the next heir for that there are lots of things we need to fix the part where you think you can solve your selfishness with money the part where you act immediat ely once you think about it i think the part of you focused on having it all to yourself has softened a bit even so its miserable that you cant act when you have to when it was me and that person we went through it straight away there are girls your age who are already married so keep that in mind once you graduate from high school you will be invited to high class societys parties even more if you are thought to be as a selfish girl even in the future it will become an embarrassment to the hou se of gremory thanks to the influence of that tv programme you are getting good support from the typical
devilsanyway we need to further the learning of your partner from now once you become a university student we need to prepare for the wedding qu ickly you know you need to take in a husband right away when you become the heir after graduating from university until then we need you to take over from otou sama smoothly you understand dont you i personally think that its okay to make you stable from now the rating game is important but only having that in mind might make you become dim as a woman and you are aaah grayfia san started preaching to buchou like a machine gun buchou also cant talk back and has a very red face while listening to her preach usually buchou acts with elegance but looking at her now she is acting like a girl her age when she is getting yelled at like this maybe shes still a kid that her family still cant leave her alone but grayfia san right now seems like sh e is taking out all the things she has been thinking while she was doing her job as a maid as well her sermon isnt stopping now now grayfia
rias is doing quite well a sudden voice im familiar with this voice everyone looks at the end of the table there was a crimson haired man buchou stood up and gets shocked at seeing that man onii sama yes that crimson haired man is the maou sirzechs lucifer sama its the entry of the real maou everyone but when did he come in i couldnt sens e his presence at all when on earth did he come to the living room of this house in the humans world hey rias how are you doing im glad that you are doing well looks like everyone in the group is the same as well sirzechs sama smiles charmingly this person has a job as a maou that makes him seem scary but he is really kind and laid back ive brought some gifts its a collection of rias photos that i produced the title is the girl called switch princess the growing of ria tan compilation its a record of her growth from when she was a child until she got into high school in japan he took out the photo compilation and starts handing it out to us oh even
the photo when she was about the age to be in junior school so buchous oppai wer e big already since then aaah i want to meet buchou from back then buchou on the other hand became red and confiscated the book from us saying dont look you cant look thank you for the cute reaction sirzechs you were supposed to have an impor tant meeting today with only the yondai maou werent you dont tell me you didnt go to it grayfia sans eyes glow sharply sirzechs sama doesnt seem like hes bothered by it and answers normally hahaha i thought i would join the meeting from here if i can send my image from here then the meeting will be ouch ouch ouch it hurts grayfia grayfia san is pulling sirzechs samas cheek very hard sirzechs sama is smiling but there are a few tears in his eyes why are you always like this whe n i have a day off maybe it wasnt good that i got today off maybe i should revert back to a maid now grayfia san was scolding him with an unpleasant face uwaa shes seriously pissed i can feel intense demonic power
with my skin just from her bei ng unpleasant what pressure no wonder buchou is afraid of her ka three small magic circles appeared on the table while emitting light zazazazazaza ara something that looks like 3d image starts to appear from each magic circle the image that is mixed with noise is starting to become normal bit by bit then three faces appeared from there sirzechssirzechs chan can you hear me heeeeey sirzechschan its still mixed with the noises but im familiar with this unique way of speaking then the face and voice become clear sirzechs chan geez you just went to the human world by yourself i also wanted to go to the human world as well mahou shoujou no its the maou shoujo serafall leviathan sama hey serafall im sorr y im at hyoudou issei kuns house serafall sama looks at me after being told by sirzechs sama ara ara you are right yahou sekiryuutei kun is rias chan there as well how do you do serafall sama buchou also greets her yes how do you do rias chan geez sirzechs chan if you were going there tell me before hand ajuka chan and falibi chan were
also curious because sirzechs chan who is always on time wasnt here even serafall sama is mad even her mad face looks cute so i can feel peace se rafall sama indeed seems like a maou shoujou wait ajuka chanand falbi i think i have heard the name of the ones that serafall sama just said the faces of the two people that appeared beside serafall sama are sirzechs for you to leave the m eeting and go to the humans world either an incident occurred or something interesting is about to happen its the latter right the super handsome guy with a fascinating face says it with a mysterious smile ehh i dont want anything bothersome i dont want to work the other one is a man with a sleepy face who is resting on his cheek im familiar with both of them when i went to the underworld the yondai maou gathered at a gathering meeting of the young devils including buchou from the six households i only met with sirzechs sama and serafall sama so that was my first time seeing them so im not wrong these two are also maou uwaaaaaaaa something crazy is going on
there are four maou on the table in my house more like the gathering of all the yondai maou this is serious im getting scared and sirzechs sama notices me aaah i still havent introduced you to them ise kun the man with the mysterious atmosphere is ajuka beelzebub he is the chief advisor for the technology departmen t including the technical equation program ajuka beelzebub sama then shifts his sight at me its good having a mysterious atmosphere because it seems devilish oh sorry nice to meet you sekiryuutei dono i have heard rumours about you ah nice t o meet you too my name is hyoudou issei oou im getting nervous since the one im talking to is a maou so this person is the maou sama who took part in the creation of evil piece sirzechs sama then introduces the remaining maou sama and the one over there who seems like he cant be bothered to do things is falbium asmodeus he is mainly in control of military affairs hello im falibium what an uninspired voice is he really a maou military affairs is it okay for maou sama without any spirit to be in charge i
was making unneeded worries how do you do beelzebub sama asmodeus sama the other group members also greet them hey falbi you have to give them proper greetings because they are rias chans servant a nd sekiryuutei chan ah hes getting yelled at by leviathan sama so asmodeus sama is being called falbi by leviathan sama asmodeus sama on the other hand isnt trying to fix his listless expression hes even making sighs serafall and sirzechs wo rk too hard i live by the thought that working means losing apart from important jobs i just leave it to my servants you know for times like these you need to gather good servants and make them do the work aaah im tired thithis is if i r emember correctly the current asmodeus came from the house of glasya labolas right he has the total opposite personality to that yankee guy who is the candidate for the next heir of glasya labolas asmodeus sama used up most of his lifetimes will to do things when he gathered his servants and gathered talented people and after i heard that he orders his servants and passes the majority of his work to others in
other words hes the type who does all the homework in the first day and use the rest o f the days for taking a break he is said to be the person with the underworlds best tactics and the best strategist buchou told me quietly also thank you for giving me an easy example i see he did his best first but left the work to his skilled ser vants after that you can do that the image of a maou inside me is crumbling no since the time i met serafall sama i somehow imagined it but they definitely surpassed my expectations by the way serafall is in charge of foreign affairs v lea ve the negotiations with other nations20 to me serafall sama winks while doing a peace sign shes cute but is it okay to leave foreign aff airs to her i think she was trying to attack the heavens because she was shocked that she didnt get called for observation day at school also it feels like sirzechs sama is doing most of the other threes work in other words is the underworld at peac e because sirzechs sama is usually a serious person hmmm
i cant understand how the world of devils works so sirzechs what is going to happen beelzebub sama asks sirzechs sama with great interest after smiling sirzechs sama looks at buchouthen a t me he looked at both of us he then spoke to tell you the truth i was going to make rias take that ceremony at the ruins of connection oou hearing sirzechs samas words the three of them smiled eh what is this about the one who was in doubt wasnt just me but also buchou she has her eyebrows up onii sama no lucifer sama what is the meaning of this are you referring to that place that is an important ruin that has been passed down from our ancestors sirzechs sama nods at bucho us question yes those from the gremory perform a rite of passage at that ruin when they hit a certain age with the one they hold dear that is you know what i mean right rias hearing that buchous face became so red that i had never seen her like that before arara what happened buchou thats interesting its more important than the meeting it hasnt been done since sirzechs chans
one back then ah congratulations i will congratulate you two before hand arara it seems like beelzebu bsama leviathan sama and asmodeus sama know about it and they seem like they were having fun when they heard about it what is happening grayfia san stands up and tells buchou thats how it is rias thats the instruction of otou sama and okaa sama what we mean by making us relieved is by performing the ritual we wont allow you to refuse you have to give at least that much relief to us though my husband ended up bringing unnecessary people into it sirzechs you understand right its re educati on for you once we get home grayfia looks at him with cold eyes while pulling his cheeks hard uwaaaa shes scary hahaha so thats how it is ria tan do your best with ise kun it hurts it hurts grayfia sirzechs sama doesnt lose his smile even if he is getting his cheeks pinched but there were loads of tears falling down from his eyes so the strongest person was maou samas wife waitme am i participating in that ritual why then my eyes met with buchous hauuuuu ise whwhat
s hould i do ththats cheating buchou for you to put on a cute and troubled face and voice like asia she totally changed from onee sama mode to a normal girl mode grayfia sans visit greetings with the yondai maou and the mysterious ritual continuous stream of unknown things occurred but it seems like i have to participate in that ritual as well seriously why do i always get involved in things like this is it because im a sekiryuutei hmmm look at this i bought each of the basic l iving ware for about 100 yen there are shops selling things for 100 yen so its wonderful cheap is the best isnt it rossweisse san who came back from shopping for 100 yen returned after the maou husband and wife left part 2 and a few days have passe d since that day buchou and i came to the ruins in the mountain region located in the gremory owned region of the underworld though our outfits havent changed and we are wearing the kuou academys uniform everyone in the group is staying at home other s wanted to come but they couldnt since this place is an important
place for the gremorys and other people not involved in it cant step their foot inside then the question is why am i allowed in front of me there is a surface of rocks and there i s a big entrance to the ruins which is delicately stone built there are pillars made from stones to the sides there are also statues of people from each of the generations of gremory between the pillars sigh its gorgeously made overall it seems lik e there isnt any visible damage at all fu what should i do if he ends up hating me because of rushing it buchou who is besides me made a big sigh i dont know what to tell her but lets just finish this quickly and go home its okay buchou i m with you just leave it to me it happened when i was trying to show off tou a mysterious voice when i looked up there was something high up in the sky that sparkled someone is coming down an enemy i made a posture and there were people w earing masks and tokusatsu outfits who came down right in front of me one two three
fourfive people i mean look at what they are wearing they look like those heroes from the japanese hero squadron21 red blue yellow green and pink from their builds red blue and green are males yellow and pink are females after they landed the five of them made a pose doooooooooon behind them a mysterious and flashy explosion occurred along with colourful smoke what is this whwho are they buchou is also cautious of course she would be no matter how you look at them they just look like suspicious people the person in the middle wearing the red outfit made a pose and shouted fuhahaha we are the mysterious maou smack the person in yellow hit the person in red with a slapstick wait the voice of that person in red sorry sorry cough from the start then we are the maou squadron maou rangers i am their leader maou red satan blue i cant be bothered but im satan green levi ta i mean im satan pink ha ummmm im satan yellow both buchou and i were in a state where we cant close our mouth no no no i mean you guys what do you mean satan

should we do i ask buchou since this is her brother then even buchou will whwho are they i can feel enormous demonic powers a maou squadron are they telling me that they are the gathering of those with the power in a maou level she hasnt realised iiiiiiiiiiiit onee sama that isnt good its fatal please realise it that is your brother bu chous onii san even if he is weirdly dressed up and doing poses thats a maou more like the people in front of us are all of the maou sama and the ultimate queen its the gathering of the invincible people in the underworld as hero squadron imposte rs seeing buchous puzzled look sirzechs samano satan red says let me call you satan red then it seems like thats the flow of it we were hired by the house of gremory there are three trials waiting for you two in this ritual i want you two to s uccessfully break through the trials with only your powers whats important is teamwork red explains it to us then pink points to a certain direction ha a mysterious flying object found what everyone attack all at once ruin
the extinct kankara formula karama equation ey celsius cross trigger torya attack something like that of asmodeus ummm then i will call it yellow shot then baaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng a scale of explosion that i have never see n before happened up in the sky five people who are maou class attacked towards the sky at the same time the shockwave created by it not only shakes us but the whole mountain area around here and the air violently the animals in the forest below us are screaming and fleeing the sky split and it created a creepy dimensional gap that i have never seen before which was spreading and a bright coloured particle of light surrounded this mountain also a phenomenon that looks like aurora was created these rare phenomena occur continuously in front of us its just an evil spirit dont scare us like that pink tehe all of the maou just attacked an evil spirit at once and overkilled it an evil spirit that receives an attack from all of the maou just how evil was that spirit geez im tired of these people you guys should have defeated loki then so what i s the trial buchou talks
as if nothing happened bubuchou you didnt see that it seems like those maou level guys attacked an evil spirit at once calm down ise evil spirits arent good so they should be dealt with thats not what i mean a aah forget about it then i understand then i will follow this flow i made up my mind that i will slide through everything even if anything happens i mean the maous are in high spirits we will be waiting at each trial the two young people who wil l carry on the gremory breakthrough all three of the trials successfully and reach the end of the ruin now each of us will be waiting at certain sections of the trial fuhahahahahaha red goes into the ruins through the entrance quickly the other four follow after him buchou and i who were left behind unexpected things have occurred i dont know what their intentions are but for each maou to be waiting in the ruins now ise lets go in since i came all the way here im not fazed anym ore lets show them how deep the relationship between us is buchou seems like she got into high
spirits since it turned out like this we cant go back i decided that i will break through each of the trials along with buchou when we went through the stone built passage we reached a room and pink was there but thats leviathan sama right pink made a peace sign at us after seeing us now you two this is the first trial gulp what will she make us do i just dont want to fight the opponent is a maou and it seems like i cant win against her more than that i dont want to fight against the cute leviathan sama for the first trial i will make you two dance he i made a dumb face after hearing the unexpected content of the trial buchou on the other hand is she seems like she had expected this and is nodding eeeeeeeeh thithis what kind of ritual is this i want you two to show me your dance if you show me an excellent dance then you will successfully pass this trial hurry dance dance for you two who would be participating in a high society party knowing how to dance is important when pink makes a
sound with her fingers an audio system appeared it starts to play classical and elegant music dance are you ser ious here ise lets start buchou gives me her hand oh i learnt this from buchous mother at the underworld buchou took my hand and bows at me we then started to dance in rhythm with the music its something i learned in the underworld so i can do it quiet smoothly buchou is also dancing beautifully and sometimes she leads the parts i am still inexperienced at i thought that i was called here as support for buchou did i get called here as her dancing partner im dancing while thinking abo ut that then my eyes met with buchous buchous cheeks are a bit red arara why that reaction ise you are doing well looks like okaa samas lesson has proved itself properly im glad with this even at times like ummmmm buchous eye is also teary and the music ended buchou and i bowed to each other after finishing the dance clap clap clap clap we received an applause from pink ufufu looks like i didnt have to worry about it both of you did well along
with getting a compliment the door made from stone opens in front of us while making a noise then move on you two go to the second trial like this buchou and i cleared the first trial as if nothing happened im stil l confused but we reached a spacious room again ya welcome green looks asmodeus sama is the one in charge of the second trial he seems like he doesnt have any will to do it ah if i look carefully two women who appear to look like his servants are on standby they are wearing maid outfits if i look there is a table and chairs in the room on top of the table there are plates and various forks and knives lined up ummm the second trial is table manners i will be watching from here so eat t he food while having your manners checked by the two maids its a point reducing system so you will fail if you reach zero points table manners now i totally cant understand what is going on what kind of ritual is this ruin supposed to have it seems like they are checking the learning of noble society
from scratch is this ritual supposed to make buchou remember about high class society well buchou is the next heir but why me im filled with doubts anyway i will sit on the chair and open the napkin like this buchou and i started eating i started to handle the movement of the fork and knife and also the spoon for the soup with elegance i was taught about these things by buchous okaa sama and the maids even at home buchou points ou t at me all the food is delicious i cant taste it till its in my throat because im nervous buchou is eating elegantly besides me she makes a good picture thats a princess for you i will also clear this without embarrassing this person and then with that eating is finished thats the end of the second trial table manners the maid said that while bowing at us im nervous table manners are harder than dancing since im from a commoners house i was unrelated with eating with elegance i wouldnt have understood it if buchous mother hadnt taught me rias sama cleared it perfectly oou to be expected from my buchou then the maid
looks at me my heart is beating fast there were few points deducted but you passed it with a high mark you did very well i made a guts pose because of happiness yeaaaaaaaah i was a bit nervous when i made a sound using the fork and knife even i can do well you did well ise touch buchou hugs on to me when she became overjoyed the sens ation of oppai is the best buchouis very pleased she even has a few of tears around her eyes and her cheeks became even redder to be expected from ise the boy i chose im so happy with this we can clear the rest wow she seems like she is dee ply moved fuaaaaaaaaa you can go now congratulations green made a single sigh and opened the door to the next trial what would happen to buchou and me when we finish all this part 3 i asked buchou while walking in the passage connected to the nex t trial by the way buchou what is it the love romance between sirzechs sama and grayfia san became a topic in my house but did something happen to them that was
my only question its been in my mind a bit about their romance if its something im not allowed to ask then i wont ask again but buchou answers me yes you have the right to know about it as a member of the gremory group onee samas surname is lucifugus grayfia lucifugus a daughter from the noble family that has been servin g under maou lucifer for generations so you meanshe came from the house close to maou buchou nods at my question just like you know in the past there was a quarrel between the maou faction who wanted to continue the war against angels and falle nangels and the anti maou faction house of lucifugus was serving under the old maou lucifer but an elder son of a certain noble fell in love with the only daughter from the house of lucifugus yes the great war that occurred in the heavens and underw orld left the outcome of losing both maou and god all three sides of devils angels and fallen angels came to an exhausted state and they were in crisis of continuing their kinds even so the maou factions who wanted to continue the war
got in a quarrel with the anti maou faction it resulted in making the maou faction flee to the end of the underworld and like that the current devil society was created even until now there are problems about the grudge back then but how can that be they fell in love during the quarrel so that is buchou continues from my word yes onii sama and onee sama that time onii sama was an ace of the anti maou faction he was even called a hero and onee sama was a person from the former maou side she also stood in t he front line as a powerful devil i heard that she was competing with leviathan sama for the spot as the ultimate female devil so something like that happened they fell in love even when they were enemies it seems like there are complicated events involved but they didnt have that in their minds onii sama and onee sama fell in love during the battle even if they were from different sides and after the battle they deepened their love wonderful right their romance is so admired that it continue s to be told amongst the women
in the underworld i also admired them there are those who think that onee sama is usually onii samas maid as a form of loyalty towards onii sama and the current maou faction but she just likes small tasks and housework i t seems like its easier to move around doing simple matters as a maid rather than as a wife of maou when she is a maid she wants to do it completely so she started to have a relationship as a maid to us as well hee the romance between man and woman d uring the battle certainly looks like a situation that women would admire then it came to my mind millicas sama who is born between the ultimate two in terms of talent isnt he the ultimate class son along with admiring them i loved and respected them but you know ise i also feel anxious at the same time compared to them who are capable i thought that maybe im an inferior sister there are times when i wonder if it is okay for me to be the next heir buchou had an expression of feeling down i see buchou has been comparing herself to
those two the whole time she probably felt inferior to them because her brother and sister inlaw are too superior you would end up comparing yourself whether you like it or not if your brother is a maou and y our sister inlaw is the ultimate queen after hearing buchous worries i felt it for the first time anyone has huge worries within them even buchou who is looked up to by everyone and who is also one of the two great onee sama also has worries buc hou is also a girl i get reminded about that sometimes i knew that buchou is a single girl but i didnt know she had worries like that i couldnt notice it i hugged buchou from behind her ise buchous worries are something that i cant imagine but there wasnt even a single time that i thought you were useless if buchou wasnt here i wouldnt have experienced such a splendid life you will alwaysalways be the best woman to me thats how i think even if i know everything about you i will always follow buchou for the rest of my life thats why lets get through all the obstacles together
that is the best thing i could say its not something i could call a cheering up but i wanted to become her strength even a bit buchou holds my hand you always look at me yes you are right i feel like i can go through anything if you are by my side it means that i am crazy about you yes lets get through this together forever she is smiling when she turned over aaa h this smile is also one of the charming points of buchou i can move straight ahead because i know how this person rias gremory smiles but im still called buchou did you say something no its nothing lets go lets finish the last trial yyes i followed buchou who went ahead the thing that buchou said i couldnt hear what she said we walked through the passage after refreshing our feelings there is only one more trial left for the so called ritual hello buchou and i a rrived at the place of the trial where blue beelzebub sama was waiting what was arranged was again a table and chairs a writing implement and a pair of prints of paper are on
the table the last trial is writing problems its an exam style test that c overs the history of the house of gremory and general knowledge of the underworld test uwa we came all the way here and the last thing is something which i am the worst at i became pale instantly thats why i will have you seated buchou and i sat on the chairs blue made a big sand clock appear using his demonic powers then the limit is one hour the test startsnow the sand clock is tipped and the test starts uo it already began i turned around the test paper that has few pages unnnn i looked at the test paper and nasty sweat drops appeared on my forehead they are all hard questions there are things about peerages and also about high class middle class and low class devils related to it maou great king and archduke are extre mely important for the high class devils the peerage goes duke prince marquess count viscount and baron was the peerage for the middle class devils baronet and knight its similar to the humans peerage but also includes devils original meaning t o it nu
nuuuuuu the applied problems are complicated the level of the test is the right level for me because all of the questions are either problems that i can answer or problems that i cant answer buchou is answering the questions smoothly be sides me thats what you call a talented girl so problems like this are a piece of cake for her im in trouble if i fail the test then i cant face buchou and her parents i used my brain in full and started glaring at the test papers now stop the test reaches the end with blues words the sand inside the sand clock has all reached down as well i used my brain to the fullest for 1 hour and rested on the table after using up my brain i did answer all the questions now i need to wait for m y mark and know the passing mark blue started marking the papers with a red pen when he was marking buchous paper the movement of his pen signifies that she is getting all the questions correct though when he was marking mine there were irregular mov ements of the pen a couple of times
i never thought that i would feel so nervous to have my test marked in front of me buchou is calm to be expected from someone with dignity she must be thinking that there is no way that she will fail i feel like im dead now then blue fixes the test paper by hitting the tips of it against the table seems like he finished marking gulp i swallowed down my spit rias gremory passes without any problems and sekiryuutei hyoudou issei kun has why do y ou stop there blue san passed but its a sudden question youre finished as soon as you make a mistake so i will make hyoudou issei kun answer whaaaaaat the heck is thaaaaat i dont know what he means please forgive me beelzebub sama to us de vils there were these things called the 72 pillars that existed a long time ago i want you to name them from 1 to 72 in a row what you make that the question its the order of the high class devils from a long time ago right when i stayed in the underworld buchous mother told me about them so its stuck in my
brain i then started to answer him bael agares vassago gamigin marbas valefor amon barbatos paimon buer gusion sitri beleth leraje eligos zepar botis bathin sallos pur son marax ipos aim naberius glaysa labolas bune ronove berith astaroth forneus foras asmoday gaap furfur marchosias stolas phoenix halphas malphas raim focalor wepal sabnock shax vine bifrons uvall haagenti crocell furcas balam alocer caim murmur orobas gremory ose amy oriax vapula zagan valac andras flauros andrealphus cimeries amduscias belial decarabia seere dantalion and andromalius hows that haha i said all of them i was told by buchous okaa sama that i need to remember this order so she made me learn it until it was stuck in my head even if i couldnt remember all of them while i stayed in the underworld i memorised them by practising saying it after that though there are high class devils who arent counted in the 72 pillars i think the house of lucifugus where grayfia san comes from also belongs there i heard that houses like that are called extra demon splendid then what houses among them have become extinct marbas valefor buer gusion leraje eligos botis bathin marax ipos aim bune ronove foras

a lot of kisses on my cheek s just with this it was definitely worth all the effort gogogogogo what seems like the last door opened blue then points at it now red is waiting you should go and report about your passing of the ritual both buchou and i nodded and we went thr ough the last door part 4 there was a light coming from the front when we walked through the passage when we came out of it the ceiling disappeared and instead there was the sky of the underworld it seemed like its the end part of the ruin and its v ery spacious because theres no ceiling so i became shocked is this the thing you call a colosseum its circular structured and has viewing seats and a battle stage buchou and i came out from one of the corners of the viewing seats red and yellow are s tanding at the centre of the battle stage in others words sirzechs sama and grayfia san we went down after we found the stairs towards the stage congratulations you two yellow warmly welcomes us aaah so this is the end then the moment i thought t
hat red stepped forward and shouts loudly yosh so you have reached here but the trials of the house of gremory arent that easy to end here i will have hyoudou issei kun fight me satan red as the real final trial now defeat me then red who made a stance that has red aura around him whaaaaaat i became so shocked that my eyes are about to pop out because of the sudden outcome obviously this are you telling me to fight red sirzechs sama as the leader of the maou squadron satan ranger i had wanted to fight oppai dragon at least once fufufufu lets decide who is the real hero of the underworld satan red no sirzechs sama is saying something so crazy because of the flow i cant do something reckless like fighting maou sama fufuf u satan red i dont know who you are but my ise is the legendary dragon sekiryuutei you have some nerve to take on the dragon who defeated the norse evil god loki buchou the person in front of us is a maou i certainly did defeat a god from norther n europe but that was because of the legendary
weapon and the school comrades i had with me if it was just myself then it wouldnt have been a fight theres no way that i can take on the strongest maou by myself red started to emit a tremendous amount of power of destruction at me who is panicked at this situation the opponent is the sekiryuutei who defeated loki im getting nervous i havent had this much anticipation in a while hes just talking crazy i need to have grayfia san deal with this s ituation please just dont over do it huuuuuh you are okay with it your husband is trying to fight a single devil with his full power tou buooooooon gyaaaaaaaaaaah sirzechs sama shoots out the power of destruction without holding back i managed to dodge it but baaaaang the shot that went behind me destroys a large portion of the colosseum this is bad i have seen buchous power of destruction numerous times but its my first time seeing it destroy everything without a trace and is it okay to destroy the ruins either way getting hit even once will eliminate me i realised the danger i am in and made my gauntlet appear
and shouted at ddraig ddraig its balance breaker yeah i been waiting for it the countdown started and the whole time its ticking sirzechs sama is showing me weird poses is it because hes confident or is it because he likes to do poses its a rule that you cant attack while transforming oh so you will follow that rule just like a hero than k you very much welsh dragon balance breaker the sound echoes and a red aura surrounding me forms into armour balance breaker boosted gear scale mail satan red since it turned out like this i wont hold back fufufu bring it on like that i ended up fighting the maou sirzechs lucifer sama about 10 minutes have passed since the battle started puffpufff the one who is obviously breathing hard is me whats wrong hyo udou issei kun is this it are your feelings towards rias this small satan red is making a pose full of confidence shit i knew he is way stronger but this is crazy i cant even hit him once all of the dragon shots were taken down i shot the m by mixing gigantic ones in with small ones but
sirzechs samas power of destruction is overwhelming none of my attacks are hitting even if i shoot them randomly they get reduced to nothing by the floating sphere of power of destruction it is small bu t has splendid power just touching it eliminates my attacks i expanded my dragon wings and charged ahead to have a melee fight but he just dodged me easily sirzechs sama is insanely strong at physical fights as well the punch with the power of destruc tion coating on his hand shaved off my armour easily in other words im not even putting up a fight because of the huge power difference between us hehehe i thought that i gained strength even if im like this seems like its still hard for me to take on sirzechs sama sekiryuutei kun do your best keep on going fighting more than 10 minutes at your current level against sirzechs proves that you have a promising future to tell you the truth i never thought you would do this well you are a better sekiryuutei than i expected zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzz the other maou samas are cheering for me from the cheering seats seems like you guys are
having fun watching the fight and everyone besides sirzechs sama have taken off their mask revealing their faces damn it and asmodeus sama is jus t sleeping these people must be enjoying this greatly power of destruction it must mean it seems like buchou who was thinking while putting her hand on her chin realised something so you finally realised it thats it that person is youre from the house of bael so she hasnt realised well she would never guess that her brother is playing a hero red then points at me with his finger you like rias dont you is it alright like this if you dont show a strong spirit to defeat me t hen i cant let you take care of rias you are right but the question is how many people are there in this world that can defeat you it cant be helped im going to use it old man tannin i inhaled lot of air and filled my stomach with lot of oxygen i then imagined a whirl of fire within my stomach im going to make fire inside my stomach with demonic power the biggest flame of demonic power that i can
create im going to be showing you the technique i learnt at the summer holiday the increased po wer of a dragon boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost transfer i transferred the power to the flames inside my stomach and breathed out all at once from my mouth i opened the mouth part of my mask booooooooooooon i breathed out a huge fire breath towards sirzechs sama you can say that this is the special dragon power i gained at that training breath of fire its not as flashy or strong as that of the old mans but unlike dragon shot it has a huge range i will make sirzechs sama burn with this by the way the name of this move is just what it looks like and is called flame blaze a splendid breath of dragon fire but after nodding his head sirzechs sama waved his hand to the side the sphere of power of destruction moved and went inside the flames then it suddenly became bigger kyuuuuuubaaaaaaan the sphere of power of destruction that expanded spread and eliminated the flames inside its range that sphere can get that bi
g all the flames i breathed out were eliminated and the remaining ones just vanished partner fighting for a long time will be a disadvantage if you are going to take him down then its better to do it at once even if you say that ddraig is there any chance of victory that will be hard to tell you the truth i never expected him to be this strong perhaps hes stronger than the old lucifer the power and destructive power is overwhelming but that power of destruction is on a different level he put his talent and effort into the concept of eliminating theres probably nothing he cant destroy with that i didnt need to hear that information in a desperate situation yellowin other words grayfia san beckons me to come to her what i s it and buchou is standing right next to her i rushed over to grayfia san while not having sirzechs sama out of my sight whwhat is it i said it while opening the mouth part of my mask grayfia san then speaks isesan touch riass breast i started to burst blood out of my nose at the shocking words and buchous face
became really red if you suddenly say that both buchou and i will be troubled yellow creates a dressing room with her demonic powers and throws us inside yellow then says it to buchou as if she is persuading her listen rias gremory this is my advice you trust sekiryuutei more than anyone correct then you must know his trait yes he can completely change just with a breast its painful to be told that by grayfia san you are right im an oppai dragon that changes with breasts22 yeah just like she says ah ddraig says it in a monotone voice and has no emotion inside his words pull yourself together sekiryuutei buchoustarts to think about it while she puts her hands on her chin she then nods to be given advice from you who i cant tell whether you are my enemy or ally is annoying but thats the only way right now buchou you still havent realised that yellow is grayfia san then buchou started to take her uniform off the white skin and her round and big oppai started to show themselves bachin the moment she unhooked her bra her oppai released themselves no matter how
many times i see them i never get bored of her pink nipples i then started to shed tears of gratitude buchous raw breasts are invincible indeed theyre the best buchou then says it with determined eyes now ise if we can break through this trial then i will gladly lend you these breasts i want to get through this trial together with you and make everyone approve of us lets go ise buchoooooooooou you still gave me determined words even while showing your b reasts i i will definitely get through this trial together with buchou buchou rias gremory sama i will touch your breasts and get through this trial with you and will defeat satan red i made the armour covering my hands disappear and aimed my ha nds towards buchous breasts my whole hand im going to grope buchous breast with all of my five fingers im your pawn and i am hyoudou issei the sekiryuutei i will be showing them the will power of oppai dragon grope the five fingers in both my hands get absorbed by her enormous breasts im making sure to taste it slowly it feels my whole hands are being enveloped by
the ultimate quality of soft oppai grope grope ive started to move my hands its an amazing sensation drip my nose als o sprinkled out a huge amount of blood aaaaaaaaah her soft and enormous oppai are stimulating my brain this is it this is seriously it buchous oppai iyaan i heard buchous pink voice that was like a finishing blow to me buchou made a cry w ith my hands uooooooooooooooooooooooooooo here it is here it comes the dragon power within me is circulating through my body gooooooooooooooooaaan in various places of my armour the aura of dragon bursts out the jewels also emit a red light im filled with energy buchous oppai power it can power me up this much maybe this is what you call the oppai dragon and switch princess if we are going to do this then we will finish it in one blow ddraig i will use all of this power for the dragon shot and i will blow away satan red ou leave it to me i concentrate all the power to both my arms my target is satan red sirzechs sama sirzechs sama please receive buchous and my feelings that is it
come the shot created from the love betwe en you and rias as a brother and also as a brother in law i would want to receive that the spheres with the power of destruction around sirzechs sama also start to gather at one point hes trying to take my shot head on bring it on saaaataaaan red goooooooo the shot created by me and buchou dragon shot neo bust burssssssssssst i shot it forward while screaming the name i just made up at the spot part 5 ara buchous face is right in front of me when i woke up the soft sensation i ca n feel on the back of my head is this buchous thigh i see im getting a lap pillow by buchou are you awake ufufufu you lost conscious after that ise buchou smiles when i got my upper body up i was at the centre of the coliseum when i looked around the coliseum was in bad shape looks like the battle arena is in a mess because of ise and satan reds battle looks like we have to send the repair team afterwards ah so i ended up destroying that much well i
was just concentrating on the fig ht so i didnt think about these matters ah wheres satan red he disappeared along with the others theres no way i defeated him then ddraig called out to me within my heart partner hmm what is it ddraig that maou lucifer he negated the dragon shot you did i did think that he has an irregular power for a devil but for him to be this strong after that he retreated with the other maous during the explosion well for you to be able to fight this much at this stage with that man m eans that you are improving well enough if it was a few months ago you would have been defeated instantly seriously i did put quite a lot of strength in it i havent neglected my training after the battle against loki either i had quite a bit of confidence in the dragon shot i just shot earlier so it was impossible even after i powered up after poking buchous breast but i think im amazing myself for having fought that much ddraig also sounded in awe the last time he talked like this was s ince fenrir well
that was also recently as well so sirzechs sama is amazing after all both of you did very well sirzechs samas voice when i turned around sirzechs sama is standing there grayfia san in maid outfit is also besides him onii sama did you just arrive here now yes i thought it was about time that you finished the trials buchou seriously please realise it sirzech sama is red sirzechs sama just tell her the truth already when buchou and i got up sirzechs sama put his h and on our shoulders you did very well both of you passed buchou and i looked at each other after hearing that and smiled yes we ended up doing lots of trials and it ended up having me fight against sirzechs sama but looks like we passed it with this both master and mistress will feel relieved grayfia sama says that looks like shes in a complete maid mode right now isekun im sorry for getting you involved in this all of a sudden sirzechs sama apologies to me nno you dont have to it allowed me to touch buchous breast so its ok thats the truth it was fun buchous breast
was really amazing i feel better if you say it like that i was also concerned with the future of both you and rias thanks to that i was able to catch a glimpse of a bright future i will leave rias to you ise kun yes i dont understand anything complicated but i will protect buchou for the rest of my life shes the woman i fell in love with congratulation rias chan leviathan sama who suddenly appeared jumped onto buchou arara when on earth did she appear ah it finally finished the one who said that along with a sigh is asmodeus sama good work for being a judge for the trial but please do your job as a maou properly when i was thin king about that a person came towards me its ajuka beelzebub hes having a serious look at me more like he is looking at my sacred gear with a very interested look can i have a look at the evil piece inside you for a bit saying that beelzebub sama poked his finger at my chest and creates many small magic circles the devilletters and numbers written on the magic circle are circulating
really fast hmm looks like you are trying to do something interesting you are going to the depths of the sacr ed gear right its only something possible because its a sacred gear type with a soul sealed in it the one who pointed out this possibility must be the viceroy of fallen angels azazel hes smiling and he looks like hes having fun he can tell ju st by looking at it for a bit i did hear that he was someone who is talented at technology but for him to be this amazing sensei this maou saw through your hypothesis instantly the power of chess pieces the trait is being used on something else and is changing a bit this is an interesting phenomenon looks like its overwritten by a code that isnt written in my program from my personal view it must be the influence of juggernaut drive but the overwritten code is messy with this program it would malfunction easily yes i will alter the evil piece within you i was shocked at the sudden offer is it alright doing something like this wont it be unfair in the rating game of course i will make
sure it wont work during the ratin g game but its better if you can use it in a real battle right no it also might be interesting if you can use it in the rating game it might receive good response from viewers who like irregular causes well since you are sekiryuutei you would contin ue to fight enemy forces it would be good to be in an environment where you can use the ideas of your ability more than that it would be interesting for those viewing it also i need to give you my gratitude for stopping my family member family memb er hes talking about diodora even if he was involved in the incident with asia i beat him to a pulp and he ended up being killed by one of the leaders of the old maou faction beelzebub sama came from the house of astaroth you dont have to worry abo ut that the ones at fault are us instead i feel deeply sorry for troubling you saying that he creates various magic circles again and seems to continue tuning the evil pieces within me he sounds as if he isnt that interested in that
incident maybe the one who isnt the most affected in that incident is this person then i spoke out what i thought excuse me how many secret factors did you include in the evil piece theres no way i would tell you that i made it so the users can find out by the mselves he replied to me like that he is truly a person who is hard to read hes calling devils users i can feel a certain type of characteristic fixation from his words sirzechs sama then says it while having a bitter smile ajuka is a rare pers on among devils who create thanks to that the technology in the underworld went up about 5 stages but he doesnt care about the role as a maou it suits me by creating and having fun hmm he certainly is a unique type of devil then leviathan sama whispers into my ears sirzechs chan and ajuka chan have always been both friends and rivals since a long time ago they were both candidates for becoming lucifer but since sirzechs chan was more talented at gathering people sirzechs chan became luc ifer while ajuka chan became beelzebub so there
was a past like that a rival huh something similar to me and vali no we havent opened ourselves like these two have he is basically my enemy both of you work too much lets take it more slowl y i cant follow your pace you will become a loser if you work asmodeus sama is certainly a unique maou sama seriously work please yes that should be it beelzebub sama who seems like he finished tuning makes the magic circle disappear i s tart to touch my chest i dont feel any changes in me did something change the one who is going to change it from now is you what i did was just a start the one who would choose a door from various doors and opening it with the key will be yo u in other words i received the factors but what will happen from now will depend on me it seems like beelzebub sama will get along with azazel sensei i thought that both of them will get along since they are both scientists but beelzebub sama sh ook his head no no it might seem like we will get along but we wont
hes talented at researching and creating something that already exists i on other hand like to create from nothing it might look similar but the differences are great hmm so its like that i twitch my neck beelzebub sama then said now i will go home i created a certain game in the human world and am managing it if im not there difficulty will arise ajuka is that the case or is it your hobby beelzebub sama smi les at sirzechs samas question yeah hobby is something i want to treasure oh yeah sekiryuutei kun do you also want to participate in my game dont worry you can participate from just a single mobile phone he asks me that but it seems creepy so i nno i will pass i declined it beelzebub sama then makes a bitter smile is that so thats unfortunate i will look forward to our next meeting rise to a new level boooon beelzebub sama creates a magic circle and disappears into the light o f transportation while vibrating the atmosphere asmodeus sama disappeared looks like he left early now there is a plan to start the party for accomplishing the trials i have
already called and gathered riass servants sirzechs sama says that are y ou serious so everyone is in the underworld and a party for accomplishing the trial for me and buchou im a bit happy i can eat delicious food i just ate before but im hungry since many things happened today hmm grayfia san creates a magic circle what is she planning to do i was in doubt and a creature appeared that one cant tell whether its a hawk or a lion a griffin its the one buchou and i rode when we escaped the engagement party sirzechs sama nods at my words yes we will return ho me immediately by magic circle you and rias should return home with this why i think its faster to use the magic circle im in doubt then grayfia san whispers into my ears its a present for ojou sama please take care of the roads ise sama roads ppresent something i dont get continues on rias ise kun theres one last thing i was going to announce it at the party but i will tell it to both of you before hand the match against sairaorg sama has been decided
both buchou and i got shocked at sirzechs samas words i see so its finally here the date and time will be about the same time as the kuou academys school festival we will manage the remaining schedules but just keep that in your mind the school festival is after the school trip after i return from the trip i will finally have the battle with that person hehe looks like there will be lots of events in the second term after confirming that buchou and i got on the griffin and flew up into t he sky about 10 minutes after we flew up in the sky on the griffin buchou and i are looking down on the scenery down below while feeling the nice wind it brings back memories the time during the first term i broke in to the engagement party i then t urned into balance breaker for the first time and beat riser i then took buchou and fled buchou who is sitting behind me then puts her body onto my back it brings back memories about that time for me too i see so buchou was remembering the same thing do you still remember
what you said to me on this griffin yes i will rescue buchou no matter what because i am rias gremorys pawn yes buchou puts her hands around my hip she attaches her body onto me and is making sure not to get away from me i feel so happy right now i am really happy i am having a drive up in the sky with the woman i love there isnt any happiness besides this oh yeah there was a continuation of the thing i said back then it hasnt changed that i still want b uchous virginity even now i said it with a strong voice buchou made an astonished face and made a sigh think about the mood for a bit i got told off hmm looks like i am too faithful to my greed i was amending for my mistake then buchou makes a small laugh and says we will always be together my lovely ise yes of course within my heart i thought that i want to call her my lovely rias one day afterword its been a while this short story collection turned out as free as i please d and more than i
had imagined in the afterword from the last volume i mentioned that short story collection would be volume 75 but due to circumstances it turned to volume 8 im sorry and now here are the introductions to each short story devils job timeline after volume 1 this is the story i should celebrate about since it was the first short story when it was published asia hasnt appeared yet so i formatted this for the short story this was published on the dragon magazine which came ou t on the same month as volume 1 even though it was a very important beginning for this series i did outrageous things like making a busha appear what was i thinking it became the subtitle of volume 8 familiars requirement timeline after volum e 2 this short story was created from miyama sans suggestion miyama san gave the opinion to the person in charge wouldnt a pokmon like story be good so i wrote this story with enthusiasm during the story a person and an attack which are like that appeared in the story but it shouldnt let it get to you rasses type is dragonlightning type wait the gremory group are
devils so they are all dark types so they are very weak against fighting types memory of oppai timeline after volum e 3 this is a short short story that was written on the back of the poster which came along with the dragon magazine you can say that this is a very important story which shaped the oppai dragonise what would have ise been like if he didnt meet the o ld man who did the picture story show i cant imagine it the oppai of tennis timeline after volume 4 the result of discussing how i wanted to play tennis with the supervisor is this this is also a horrible story in the previous volumes afterwar d i said yuki onna will be appearing so how was your reaction everyone i also didnt expect a moe moe gorillias illustration so i laughed my ass off when i saw the illustration miyama san is the ultimate illustrator who can draw from cute girls to a shocking yuki onna by the way this has no relation with the prince of tennis hell teacher azazel timeline after volume 4 this is the first story when the short story became serialized i
wrote this because i wanted to show off azazel senseis mo ments and also rias and asia in their younger girl form during the story a super robot appeared but short stories can have anything happen more than the actual volumes plus it is like a parallel since around this time akeno sans seductive role began by the way this story has no relation with hell teacher nube 300 ise timeline after volume 5 the story which was published in dragon magazine i used the number theme of 300 i wrote a tragedy about ise increasing his number to 300 and again th is has nothing to do with the 300 hundred strong men the fun gremory family timeline after volume 7 this is a new written story which was written to preserve the settings i also gave details about sirzechs and grayfia on it people around them and ise fears them thinking that sirzechss group are bunch of monsters but i do think that rias group are also a bunch of monsters while ise being at the front truly they are frightening siblings the supervisor gave me the opinion that lately rias doesn t have any spotlight so lets
make a story about it so it was decided that i would write this she is indeed the main heroine but she seems to be pushed back by akenos aggressive attack akenos popularity is too high no buchou is also popular you know this time there were those who appeared for the first time those people are the remaining yondai maou ajuka and falbium who is also called falbi he is a former rival of sirzechs and a lazy maou ajuka is someone whose power is in the same class as sirzechs and he is a natural creator type person so he does the background jobs old fans might realise it but ajukas word includes something special in it somaybe it might include what would happen in the future now some explanation of the set ting behind the scene among sirzechss group there is the kougyou23 of the deep sea bahamut among serafalls group there is magical beas t king of the earth behemoth among ajukas group there is king snake of the realm of the dead falak and among falbiums group there is the blue holy bull kuyutha they are all legendary creatures for them to appear just for
the settingprobabl y wont happen i just revealed it to the fans who likes the setting of it extra demons are famous devils who are not from the 72 pillars among them there is mephistopheles and other ridiculously strong devils and they hid themselves in the depths of the underworld making a certain distance with the current devils government only a countable number of their clans have survived even the status of those from grayfias house is unknown apart from her the extra demons are just only for settings curr ently the third arc will be about ise witnessing and experiencing about the world of devils from the inside and outside the inside part would be about the devils society the outside part would be about their contacts with other factions so what will i se obtain from those things the khaos brigade will make their move once again but for him to head straight forward even though his opponent is a maou he is hot blooded guy like usual ise also had ajuka do something to him so what would happen after this the next volume will finally be about the school trip ise the 2nd years would rampage
in kyoto now for the thanks miyama zerosama supervisor h sama i was able to have volume 8 get released safely thank you very much due to the number o f them im regretful that i couldnt have all of the illustrations included in them i definitely would like an illustration collection book for dxd even myself the writer would like one as well i give my thanks to all the fans thanks to you all the sales are increasing i dont know how long it can continue but im thinking of doing as much as i can please do support me from now on as well the truth is im writing about a different story im thinking it would be good if it can get released whil e doing dxd that happens in the exact same world as dxd but im hoping it will turn out to something both dxd and new fans would enjoy currently my priority is dxd so please wait patently for it the truth is there are hidden factors within this short story collectionmaybe anyway please do support me translators notes and references 1 japans civil war 2 jump up military commander 3 jump up

all fours with each motion her ample bosom shook creating images i will tearfully treasure for a lifetime isekun is going to abandon me and have fun in kyoto akenosan cried out in sadness her arms around my neck her soft tender body leaning tightly against meeeeeeeeeeeeee how how could that be akenosan its just four days and three nights well see each other again soon i answered in an excited voice to be honest my mind was almost blown away by the sensations of akenosans body the yukata had almost slid off completely and akenosan was approaching full nudity massive nosebleed thatthat sweet fragrance from akenosans soft black hair slightly elevated body warmth she must have come out of the bath just now akenosan lied on my chest and sounded as if she was about to cry two whole days i wont be seeing you i could die of loneliness what was this ever since the battle with loki akenosan has displayed even stronger desires to have me spoil her when alone together when watching television in the living room she leaned closely with her head onmy shoulder when she invited me to go shopping and i answered im
a bit busy right now she pouted with a cute angry expression after i changed my answer to lets go she instantly reverted to that impossibly cute smiling face in voice and attitude she had already transformed into such a cute girl that one could easily mistake her for being the same year or even younger than me this cute oneesama has exceeded buchou in many situations though she still maintained the usual oneesama attitude in school everything changed in front of me buchou and akenosan must have been hiding the art of killing me with cuteness akenosan clasped my hands and intertwined her ten fingers with mine so for tonight i will refill four days and three nights worth of you re refill my brain was about to boil but i struggled to hold myself back and questioned her if this cute akenosan had her way with me i could die today without regret yes refill caressing isekuns skin to be fondled by isekun to feel your manliness i will be able to experience the true meaning of being a woman these words were too stimulating and i couldnt stop another spurt of blood from my nose no good
no good she is a respected senior even though she is so incredibly cute that one could mistake her for a younger girl i can not forget my respect hhow can it be iim just a junior please dont use honorifics during these times akenosan interrupted me the color in those irises seemed to be asking why but but akenosan is a senior akenosan clutched at the bedsheets tightly there is no senior or junior in bed only man and woman that is the only point that mattersmman and woman gulp i couldnt help but swallow hard again mmman wwwoman wwhat is this what kind of invincible force do these erotic words hold as akenosans face approached my lips were about to ah at moments like these the most likely one to appear was akeno what are you doing feeling the demonic presence that was difficult to describe i cautiously turned my head back to find the crimsonhaired oneesama with a dangerous aura released of course i knew it the long flowing crimson hair was fluttering from the extremely strong aura i will surely be killed this time akenosan went ufufu laughing seductively and began to stroke her long black
hair ara ara scary oneesama is glaring at me and isekun could it be seeing us like this you are jealous ufufu i just went to take a bath and then you came to seduce ise how daring have you gotten im always this daring all the time look like this tight rubbing akenosan pressed that smooth tender body of hers against me and the grinding motions stimulated my entire bodyyyyyyy face breasts arms thighs that uniquely feminine softness and flexibility was making me feel like all my bodily functions are going to halt well said akenosan is too sly a third voice my wits returned to find someone hugging my head from behind taking a good look konekochan when when did youyes that was konekochan did she hide her presence and sneak into the room wearing a thin white robe cat ears and tail deployed hugging my head tightly with her cute small body mmmmmmm konekochans body was also smooth and soft with a sweet fragrance i dont want to separate from senpai either senpai lets do several days worth of sennjutsu treatment for tonight koneko pressed her body against my back while showing a lonely expression is this
incredible feeling the sense of being hugged from behind by a little girl that furry white tail wrapped itself around my wrist ah the soft fur on konekochans tail felt so nice by the way konekochan this kind of daring display used to be only between the two of us so now its ok to be seen by others or was it because i am leaving on the school trip so you are acting like akenosan eeven koneko but ise is clearly mine he is my most adored ise you all are going too far this was getting incomprehensible in front of me buchou was trembling her face pouting tearfully oneesama that expression is too cute slamwith a sound the door opened to reveal asia seeing the situation she immediately began to cry out how how can this be not only rias oneesama but even akenosan and konekochan too ooh ooh ooh leaving out just me unacceptable i have to join in too hey asia jumped on the bed grabbing my leg she hugged tightly with the determination of never letting go i wont let go of isesan we have to sleep together tonight it was becoming a most incredible
situation akenosan konekochan and even asia were tightly hugging me this did it count as happiness but something seemed to be off i was very happy and completely in over my head but why was everyone fighting with one anotherit was clearly a situation of opulence but somehow the atmosphere seemed to have thinned exceptionally buchou finally couldnt stand it and began to yell really you all why wont you listen to me your master buchou gave her orders as the master however the other girls had no intention of obeying quietly because he is my isesan senpai isekun no hes mine the tearful screams of buchou echoed within the house as the school trip loomed near my bed turned into a battlefield which tore my feelings between happiness and worry will the school trip go smoothly after alllife 1 yeah lets go to kyoto part 1 in the future i would like to establish a norse magic school in gremory territory and start a business training new valkyries out of devil females rossweissesan was describing her plans for the future as an angel i never thought i would visit the home of the upper class devils what a supreme
honour this must be the grace of the lord and maousama irina was also very happy as the date of the school trip loomed near we gremory servants plus irina were chatting with buchous parents while having tea in the dining room of the gremory home to commemorate the completion of her team buchou needed to reintroduce us all to her parents elegantly sipping tea while chatting was this a hobby shared by the upper levels of society or perhaps it was because i have never had the experience of having tea and chatting surrounded by so many servants i felt very uneasy hahaha rossweissesan seems very interested in devil industries as the head of the gremory family i will look forward to your contributions buchous father laughed openly as always he acted full of noble flair buchous mother sipped some tea put down her cup and changed the subject by the way isesan and all you second years will be going on the school trip soon right are you going to kyoto in japan yes yes according to plans we will be leaving for kyoto immediately i answered buchous mother was quite strict on manners so i spoke every
sentence with apprehension last year rias brought back some japanese pickles from kyoto which were quite tastybuchous mother actually ate japanese pickles no buchou ate them all the time at home still i felt rather surprised at the revelation its impossible to associate the noble lady gremory with japanese pickles i your humble servant will bring some back from the trip ara thats not what i meant i apologize you really dont have to do that no hearing my answer buchous mother blushed slightly and brought her hand to the corner of her mouth this response was unexpectedly cute after more trivial chatting the team completion commemorative tea party ended successfully after the tea party we were prepared to return home via magic circle but because sirzechssama suddenly returned to the gremory castle we had to go greet him before leaving i will go too millicassama also wanted to see his father so he came with us on a special path used only when sirzechssama returned to the castle sirzechssama was meeting with someonea certain blackhaired guest ah looking closely that guest was sairaorgsan in noble attire thank you for your hospitality looking good rias and the sekiryuutei even under
such normal circumstances an overwhelming presence could be felt from him his violet eyes were shining full of spirit and determination yes it is great that you came to greet us you too look wonderful but let me apologize for my delayed greeting oniisama salutations we heard you returned home and came to greet you dont sweat the formalities it makes me uncomfortable thank you all sirzechssama picked up millicassama in his arms and smiled at us the reason he returned had to do with sairaorgsan if that was true then it must be related to the upcoming matchas i puzzled over this buchou asked sirzechssama oniisama sairaorg came because yes he came expressly to deliver some fruit a specialty from bael territory how thoughtful of our cousin we were talking about how rias should visit the bael household to express our gratitude some time sirzechssama spoke yes for sirzechssama sairaorgsan was his cousin from the mothers side thinking of it like that sairaorgsans status is actually quite high we were talking about a few things about the next match rias he has no special requests about the rules except that all complicated restrictions be lifted from the rules of
combat hearing sirzechssamas words buchou was surprised but her eyes become serious sairaorg that is to say no matter how many uncertain elements there are on our side you will accept them all is that what you mean to buchous serious question sairaorgsan smiled fearlessly that is correct whether the vampire that stops time or the sekiryuutei who reads thoughts and blows girls clothes away i will take them all onif i can not handle your allout attacks how can i call myself the heir of the bael family sairaorgsans open acceptance caused all of us servants to gasp what an amazing spirit and determination this man really wanted all of us to put our all into it with piercing eyes sairaorgsan gazed at buchou and then shifted towards me it was a solemn presence that gave a chilling and frightening feeling but utterly devoid of malevolence there is not a single shred of evil felt just pure battle spirit this guy was a pure battle maniac just like vali but similarly both did not carry any evil in their intentionsso scary tthere actually exists someone who wants to take on my power so actively this makes it even more
scary gasper hid behind my back showing a scared expression hes right after all it is taking on the powerful ability of stopping time eeven my skills are accepted that makes me feel so thankful i must thank you watching us all along sirzechssama made a suggestion yes there is no better opportunity than this chance encounter sairaorg once said you wanted to spar with the sekiryuuteiisekun right thats right i did say that before then just a friendly match dont you want to experience the fist of the heavenly dragon due to the suddenness my mind was a complete blank but after a moment i was able to react wwwhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat to have me fight sairaorgsan right here right now really no no even if you suddenly say so ignoring my wide open eyes of surprise sairaorgsan asked buchou rias what do you say buchou considered for a moment then answered with determination since oniisama no maousama says so then naturally i have no reason to refuse ise is that ok what are you saying really i have to go uwuwuwu if buchou said so i can not refuse and in front of asia akenosan and all the girls i
cant look weak in front of them yes yes if you dont mindi stepped forward and made such a declaration since things had come to this i had no choice but to give it my all after all sooner or later we have to face the attacks of the strongest young devil sairaorgsan if thats the case then let me face him now to provide a useful reference in preparation for the match furthermore by watching my fight with sairaorgsan the other servants will definitely benefit from it as sairaorgsan and i exchanged glances sirzechssama nodded in agreement then show me the fists of the first amongst the new generation of devils and the sekiryuutei hearing that sairaorgsan thank you for the opportunity i will show you clearly my fist his face showed a bold smile in the basement of the gremory castle there was a vast training hall easily large enough to house the entire kuou academy stadium we of the gremorys and sairaorgsan went over there together as for millicassama grayfia took him some place else to wait in front of me sairaorgsan took off his fancy noble attire leaving just a gray shirt even through the shirt
his perfect body could be clearly seen muscular and extremely sturdy strongly built upper arms huge fists the muscles on his shoulders and back were bulging furthermore he was totally handsome as well as expected from the family of buchous mother ddraig lets go leave it to me i summoned the gauntlet on to my hand and the balance breaker countdown beganthough as long as nothing serious happens in that short time the balance breaker armor could be sustained for a long period of time but battlefields are unpredictable and i would always get nervous during the short time limit but during the countdown sairaorgsan patiently waited is he that confident it must be because he wanted to see my full strength and didnt want to do anything unnecessary everyone here understood that i can not show cowardice in front of all the other servants as well as buchou even if i lose i must fight to the death and lay everything out on the line now the countdown has ended welsh dragon balance breaker as the gauntlet sounded out it gave off a flash of red light covering my body the red aura took on the form of armorboosted
gear scale mail pak giant dragon wings spread from behind my back and i readied for attack with a flowing motion sairaorgsan also entered a stance though i have already seen the match video between sairaorgsan and the delinquent from the glasyalabolas family sairaorgsans speed was still faster than expected even god speed kiba would feel threatened by this speed probably it is definitely faster than me i can not keep letting my opponents make the first move i must take initiative with suicidal abandon gooooooooo firing up my back boosters to the max i fly straight forward preparing a straight right punch i thrusted forwards next is the fist in one motion why isnt he dodging faced with my formidable straight punch sairaorgsan was not making any effort to evade bastard are you saying there is no need to dodge fine you can take my punch head oncrash with a deafening sound my straight right punch made contact with sairaorgsans face hhe really didnt dodge not only that it was a clean and perfect hit a chill at the instant of contact i suddenly felt an indescribable chill forcing me to rapidly take several steps back after distancing myself
i put up a stance to attack again sairaorgsans body showed no signs of injury wait a minute i put quite a lot of force into that straight punch though boost wasnt used to think he is completely unhurt without defending sairaorgsan pointed at the part where he got hit and smiled an excellent punch straight and to the point a pure punch full of strong will a normal devil would have lost to such a punch but sairaogsan vanished before my eyes i am no ordinary devil sairaorgsans voice and fist next came from behind my back crash kaching sairaorgsans fist pounded towards me when did he get behind my back damn it though i raised my arms to defend but the heavy force of the punch was shocking even though the attack was caught by my crossed arms but the gauntlet the gauntlet portion of the armor has been destroyed by the punch just now my body having completely lost balance i quickly pull away by shooting demonic power out through the back boosters so fast my eyes couldnt follow at all by the way he vanished i thought my eyes were used to catching high speed motions
from training with kibaunderestimated him perhaps a bit but still i knew that wasnt the only reason by the way my arms were numb and had no feeling for my arms to become like that from the impact of the gauntlets destruction just now no at least the fingers can still move i can still fight my bones are still ok ddraig please regenerate the gauntlets ah understood red aura surrounded my arms and once again the gauntlets were formed sairaorgsan gave an impressed smile hoho you didnt get sent flying well that was just a hello punch a hello punch a hello punch destroyed my armor wwhat kind of joke is this with just a fist this is first time for anyone to break apart boosted gear scale mail with their bare hands i have three weapons strongly built body fast legs martial artshere i come sairaorgsan vanished again the side the opponent has instantly appeared beside me i shrank back to avoid sairaorgsans attack at my body howling it was the sound of the punch breaking through the wind what amazing force from the punch creak with a blunt sound cracks appeared on my armor near the abdomen
how can this be simply brushing past was enough to crack it open damn it i cursed out and punched back crash but sairaorgsan took it with his face again without dodging no damage gofeeling a counterattack coming i pulled back again that instant using the thrusters to jump back the vigorous sound of air rushing sairaorgsans kick missed but the force of the missed kick caused huge cracks to appear from the centre of the training hall and rose along the four walls if that kick were to hit i felt shivers along my spine with that i was already panting just a few exchanges and it was already clear extremely strong unimaginable how can this devil be from the same generation as buchou and diodora astaroth he is far stronger than diodora ah this really surprises me this man from the bael family has trained his power to the max using rating game types this is a power type who has kept increasing offensive power again and again how interesting a man who pursues pure destructive power totally extreme it makes me very interested wow ddraig showing an interest towards someone apart from maou and other dragons true
this was someone so strong that diodora is entirely no match for him perhaps he is stronger than rias several fold no more than ten fold the devil born in the great kings family without inheriting the power of destruction with nothing but his body his only choice was to train his body and successfully became the heir like me a devil without inborn talent this was not the result of short term halfassed training and to think this young devil was from the same generation as buchou buchou truly was in a difficult situation to compete with such a person sairaorgsan is definitely a massive wall obstructing buchous dreams furthermore he is an even higher and steeper absolute wall in front of my dreamsamazing i said it naturally from the brief exchange i was already full of intense respect and admiration so you can reach this level of strength completely through training faced with my question sairaorgsan replied i just believe in my own body thats all truly an amazing character this sentence made me understand that this person must have conquered unimaginable obstacles and hardships and because of that i must attempt to give my all and test
my own limits even if it is me i can not admit defeat this was a good chance to try out beelzebubsamas suggestion after beelzebubsama helped me to adjust the pieces within my body he also made a personal suggestion about me and the pieces promotion to rook i made the declaration promoting to rook yes rook not queen power flowed into my body with that offensive and defensive power rose accordingly the rook sairaorgsan showed a surprised expression towards my promotion he must have expected me to promote to queen sairaorgsan disappeared once again its coming i sent power into the legs and entered a defensive stance as if my feet were rooted to the floor gritting my teeth i wrapped my body in aura boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost using the dragons power to enhance defensei also didnt forget to power up my right fist at the same time crash sairaorgsan appeared from the front a sent a heavy punch into my abdomen a powerful impact the force of the punch penetrates straight into the backbone cough spreading throughout my entire body was intense pain as well as a feeling like everything was drying out the impact transmitting straight to the feet
my legs trembled nonstop thanks to having lowered my center of gravity i withstood it though my consciousness was nearly lost at one point but i returned to full awareness if i hadnt gritted my teeth and struggled to endure it my consciousness will definitely be overburdened and lost the abdomen armor though damaged has not been completely shattered aiming at the exact instant when sairaorgsan withdrew his fist once again i sent a powerful straight punch into sairaorgsans face crash though it felt like punching a thick stone walli felt through my hand there was a tiny feeling that something cracked spurt fresh blood came out of sairaorgsan but at the same time choke blood also spurted out from the mask area of my helmet blood was rising from my abdomen and vomiting out of my mouth how much damage has been taken from that punch to the belly ribs must be cracked perhaps broken just the act of breathing caused intense pain all over the body but i endured it my armor and i made it throughlately all these enemies have been characters who could penetrate my armor with ease and made me think about focusing my energies
towards defense well this was a natural feeling when i keep fighting with all these existences that were stronger than me however diverting power to defense was an interesting thing to try though it hurt like hell it made it clear as long as the sacred gears power was used flexibly for defense it is possible to take the attack of a super power type straight on and survive at the same time as withstanding the attack going from full defense and switching to counterattacking was also key see sairaorgsan was nosebleeding finally a decent counterattack this was it though it wasnt always useful this was my everything promotion to rook to enhance attack and defense has proven its worth it works i can fight with this man incredible new strength and motivation flowed into me simply from realizing that well no matter how you look at it its me who got more injured but it is no longer the case that i can not injure him perhaps even if i lose i can break an arm of his though i currently can not defeat him but at this level let me give it my all sairaorgsan wiped the blood
off his nose with his fingers as if delighted from the bottom of his heart he smiled promotion to rook eh looks like it wasnt a wrong decision i put in quite a bit of power into that punch your attack and defense were excellent as a rook perhaps the rook which specializes in offense and defense rather than the allrounder queen is better suited to a power type like you what is it i see questioning in your eyes you have a question about our fight no how should i put it those upper class devils often umm look down on me but sairaorgsan has been serious from the start its surprising this man i can feel he approved of me from the very beginning all this time raizer diodora and other upper class devils none of them gave meany respect so the current situation makes me feel refreshed yet a little shy hearing my words sairaorgsan let out a sigh so thats why you have been underestimated all this time dont worry i will not underestimate you to survive and win a direct battle against the old maou faction as well as loki the norse god of evil
i have no reason to look down on you these words made me tremble with delight sairaorgsan made a fearless smile fighting you also makes me happy your punches are pretty good its been a long time since ive been punched to a nosebleed facing a similar type is what makes me happiest your punch must have been trained it is something that can be understood after being hitdont worry try to hit me with your full strength isnt that the reason why you are standing here i felt myself completely taken by sairaorgsans charismatic smile approving of me this bastard when clearly he is an opponent that i must beat you truly are an opponent i must have a good long chat with after the match i extend my fist and enter a stance abdominal armor recovered i will take back the promise to break his arm just now even if i lose i will break both his arms this is my response to you here giving my best effort come hyoudou issei just focus on beating me show me the power of the sekiryuutei ok here i come boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost i fired off dragon shoot towards sairaorgsan who was
charging straight onsmack crash with a single brush of his fist in a horizontal sweep sairaorgsan deflected my dragon shoot into the wall of the training hall no effect after all it wasnt the bishop my magic is too weak right now i am the rook must i go with a fist fight all the way now is the time to defend against a counterattack i held both fists in a stance in front of me facing sairaorgsan straight on you want to exchange blows with me interesting just try it as sairaorgsan roared at me i took a leap forward isesan suddenly asia cried out what happened i shifted my gaze over and asia continued rrecharge after touching brbrbrbrbreasts isesan will become more powerful eh everyone was shocked by asias words and then xenovia went hah as if she understood and continued where the conversation left off yes thats right ise is the oppai dragon his power surely increases after touching our breasts buchou please fulfill the duty of the switch princess right here rias oneesama ii wont mind please give isesan the power of brbrbreasts if this continues he will lose xenovia and asia begged buchou in earnest
on the other hand buchou showed a troubled expression due to the sudden request asia xenovia i know you dont want me to lose but dont go yelling out breasts in such a loud voice but the two of them were completely serious asias eyes were full of tearstthats the truth as long as he has buchous breasts senpai can become infinitely powerful even gasper really has my cute junior been looking at me with such eyes yes sexual desires are isekuns source of power even irina still everyone cares so much about me it must be because they dont want to see me lose it felt complicated but comforting somehow really touching breasts will give a power up i thought it was just a rumor even sairaorgsan is asking this its true koneko confirms decisively sorry i am a pervert i am the chichiryuutei ufufu what are you going to do rias akeno was smiling at buchou with a subtle expression ddo you want to touch iif you want to become stronger ii can oneesamas face was all red as she asked me buchouooooooooo really even in front of your cousin if its really ok i will fondle to
get stronger is this how it works every time hmm ive never seen such a custom among the asgard rossweissesan was speaking with a frozen expression she has made a very big misunderstanding i bet kiba was laughing awkwardly going ara ara pu puhahahahahahahahaha sairaorgsan heartily laughed as if very much amused so thats the case touching rias breasts will make you stronger hohoho i will remember it sekiryuutei lets continue another timesairaorgsan made such a suggestion i can still fight i can fight as long as i touch breasts with my pervert nature the current me might possibly win your spirit is great i too can still fightbut if this continues i wont be able to stop myself i will fight to the very last blow which would be quite a shame after all arent you in the process of awakening something inside you my efforts to explore my own possibilities throughout the battle have been discovered sairaorgsan put on his nobles attire walked up to me and placed his hand on my shoulder lets wait until you finish your awakening fight in your best condition that is the fight i am looking for with the sekiryuutei our duel
will conclude within the future rating game in front of all the vips as well as the common crowd to determine our ratingswhether it is you or i we both have our own dreams so let us meet again at the match rias and rias servants see you next time that is on the stage carrying our dreamscome with everything youve got and i will beat you with my full strength leaving those words sairaorgsan took his leave with sirzechssama and departed the tension of the battle dissipated i released the armor sirzechssama came over and asked how are his attacks too similar it is so similar to my own fist that it shocked me sirzechs smiled as he nodded yes the same as you in order to compensate for his inadequacies he trained with everything he got this is how he obtained such power completely direct attacks this is what devils lack in generalreally sairaorgsan is so similar to me foolishly direct the same type hence our mutual understanding this was the only way attack defeating the enemy and so that man has been training himself so hard by the way in the fight just now he already cast
seals to apply heavy loads on both his arms and legs sirzechssama revealing the truth made me both shocked and excited no matter how strong i got that man will always stay in front of me it was good to have a target it gave value to struggling hard sirzechssama continued to explain he has already reached the levels of experienced kings in the rating game he has also stopped the terrorist activities of khaos brigade many times however isekun is also amazing as one of the few who fought against sairaorg without losing their will to battle there have been numerous cases where sairaorgs opponents have completely lost their will to fight ever again finding their prized demonic powers useless against him these proud devils take a huge hit to their self esteem when they are defeated by a bare physical body upper class devils have a lot pride but find it difficult to recover when faced with defeat i just dont want to lose again i dont want to lose another rating game i have never won in an official match diodoras match doesnt count i gave him a sound beating but that was not official raizers match
sona kaichous match i lost both times so next time i definitely against the bael family i definitely will survive till the end and obtain victory sairaorgsan i will defeat you and surpass you please wait patiently while i catch up i swallowed my regret and renewed my determinationiseoniisama when riasoneesama graduates from high school are you still going to call her buchou just as i was about to go home cute little millicassama tilted his head asking that question thatwell if buchou graduates how should i call buchou then come to think of it the two oneesama in their third year will be leaving the occult research club in the near future if thats the case there will be a new buchou is that so i will no longer be able to call buchou buchou any more how should i call buchou by that time riasoneesama or is master most appropriate but there is one name that i wish to use the most rias because she is family living together because she is the one i love the most if only once i wish to call her that part 2 it was the day of the school trip from
yesterday night i had been unable to sleep due to excitement when buchou discovered it i ended up sleeping soundly in her gentle embrace originally burying my face in her bosom was enough to make me temporarily forget about the school trip and sleep well but due to the extreme excitement i was unable to sleep for a short while truly buchous breast pillow was the best after this and that our scene changed to the waiting area of the tokyo bullet train station the group has gathered in a corner of the waiting area out of earshot of others of the ones staying behind only buchou came to see us off though akenosan konekochan and gasper wanted to come the first and third years had normal classes since they were not allowed to fall behind in school only buchou came to the station by the way about the preparations for the school festival the first and third years have no choicebut to cover the shares of us second years as for what the occult research club plans to do for the festival it is a secret here this is a pass for each of you as we second years
were about to leave buchou was handing out to us something like a card everyone took one and confirmed this is the legendary kiba asked and buchou nodded yes this is required for devils to enjoy kyoto the socalled free bus pass since most of kyotos sights are temples or in other words kyoto is full of sites heavy in spiritual power this normally caused all sorts of inconveniences for devils after all shrines and temples are normally taboo for devils however devils can move freely using this pass which was issued by existences like onmyoji and youkai from the kyoto office in charge of affairs there of course a valid reason was required beforehand we used the same kind of pass last year as long as there is a legitimate reason they will issue passes even to devils gremory servants sitri servants and heavens messenger do you realize how fortunate it is to have certain forces backing you all buchou winked and i cheered wonderful long live the gremorys with this we can visit the temples of kiyomizudera kinkakuji ginkakuji yes just keep it in your skirt or a pocket in the uniform and you will be able to
enter those famous sights enjoy your sightseeing there yes after responding we immediately placed the cards into our pockets with that things were ok now asias cellphone rang hello kiryuusan yes xenoviasan and irinasan are together with me it seemed to be kiryuusan calling asia bowed to buchou after taking the callthen rias oneesama we will be taking our leave we are going we are going now yes take care asia xenovia and irina bid buchou farewell and turned to leave are they making final confirmations i seemed to have packed handkerchiefs tissues and underwear properly but let me go check again later then its about time for me to go i will bring souvenirs back kiba also bowed and turned towards where his class was gathering leaving only me and buchou buchou began to adjust my collar collar take care of your appearance even in kyoto dont forget you are a student of kuou academy yes yes having adjusted my collar buchou leaned her face against my shoulder buchou even though ive been trying to hide it i am the same as akeno i will be very lonely the days you are gone still even if its like this
i have improved a bit in the first term i really couldnt bear having you away from my side but now i can at least endure not seeing you for a short while buchou perhaps she lavished too much affection towards me all the time was that why she felt sad about being separated from me and recently she really treated me like true family certain rare expressions and actions have appeared more naturally from her nowadays i held buchous hands and smile thats a bit exaggerating even if im not here there is konekochan and gasper i know but you still havent realized your own attraction but then again i like that about you tooas buchou smiled bitterly she drew her face near and our lips pressed together my ability to think went completely out the window my face turned red and i remained motionless because because this was such a sudden kiss bububuchou buchou smiled cutely at my shocked state and stuck out her tongue this is a goodbye kiss what are you panicking for its not even the first time we kissed lets just say even if you were to initiate the kiss its totally fine but
but even if you say that still its shocking hearing my response buchou showed a regretful smile and said i am satisfied with this even if you are at kyoto i will be able to endure the loneliness take care ise understood i will take my leave buchous kiss the best ah i am being so spoilt by her this felt like some kind of lucky omen this trip will be a blast and so we began the school triplife 2 arrival at kyoto part 1 it was roughly ten minutes after the bullet train had left tokyo station for me this is actually the first time taking the bullet train matsudas face was full of excitement as he sat on the seat in front chattering away i still have recollections about the first time i took the bullet train still it was in early childhood when i didnt know anything so actually theres not much to it i was sitting on the last row of seats alone the seat beside me was empty while matsuda and motohama were in front across the aisle was xenovia and irinas seats the scenery outside the windows was changing rapidly due to the
high speed of the train over there xenovia and irina were happily chatting away as they looked out the window although the bullet train felt rather fresh to me it didnt leave me an impression as deep as the train to the underworld had how should i put it perhaps it was because i saw with my own eyes the process of transferring to another world which gave a feeling of entering a different dimension xenovia came over to me and sat on the empty seat her first words were ise i want to tell you something what is it xenovia this time i did not bring durandal i am unarmed oh oh she suddenly confessed something incredible was it really true you didnt bring durandal why yes i think its the alchemists belonging to the orthodox church they discovered a technique to suppress durandals offensive aura hence durandal has been sent over to them via channels belonging to heaventhe orthodox church was another major faction within the church but they did not help much in the excalibur recovery affair xenovia laughed ironically even the orthodox church is coming out to help looks like it must be due to the
efforts of the seraphim under michaels leadership however it is still a rare opportunity to have those alchemists reforge the sword due to the current alliance it seemed like the conflicts between christian factions have also lessened xenovia continued to suppress durandals offensive aura without diminishing its power as a holy sword this is really something that caught my interest however it is truly shameful for me to be unable to control it properly despite being the owner of durandal how can i call myself a knight am i better off dead oh lord ah starting to self abuse really doing this right off the bat i understand if anything happens just borrow ascalon from me yes much appreciated always lending me this sword its fine though i also need it sometimes but considering the current situation its much more efficient to lend it to you but then ise really should train in sword fighting dont waste your gifts i have when kiba is your training partner your sword skills definitely improve yes finishing the conversation xenovia returned to her original seat after that i looked outside for a while but then i heard light highpitched screams coming from the
front i looked ahead it turned out kiba was coming from the train car in front of ours once he saw me he walked over to my side eh wwent over to hyoudou hhow can it be kibakun is going to that perverted territoryhyoudou x kiba must be an undeniable truth the girls began to mourn is my area a quarantine damn is it wrong to have a handsome friend although i once hated kiba due to the unfairness of treatment he is my important comrade now a reason to hate him now of course it still exists handsome guys truly are unforgivable existences can i sit beside you while i was occupied in my thoughts kiba had already taken the empty seat beside me whats up i leaned my face against the window frame narrowing my eyes as i asked i wanted to know your itinerary once you get there so that theres a plan in case of emergencies ah after all we are in different classes where do you plan to go tomorrow starting our tour from sanjuusangendou you from the temple of kiyomizudera and then ginkakuji and kinkakuji though these three places are a bit distant from
one another but if we put in the effort to finish the most famous places in the first two days then we can take it easy the third day and advance from tenryuuji tenryuuji our class is planning on going there on the third day too we may very well meet at the togetsu bridge what about the last day just end it by casually walking around the kyoto station and getting souvenirs by the way irina mentioned about wanting to go on the kyoto tower the schedules for each class were prepared beforehand and handed in to the teachers the students were even required to create travel guides for their own class to use after exchanging details about our sightseeing plans we changed topics isekun did you join the activity with the various maousamaah ah it was an activity that totally revamped my image of the underworld a few days ago buchou and i participated in a mysterious gremory family ritual in the banquet that night buchous parents were very happy and lavished me with praise at the banquet there were also things like banners proclaiming congratulations young mistress young master i felt like there was something i didnt
know about going on behind my back but anyway it cant be bad so im not going to be particularly concerned actually after the ritual finished i even received beelzebubsamas personal special suggestion i changed the subject and said to kiba special suggestion yes about the compatibility between the characteristics of the pawn and the sekiryuuteis power so far when using the sekiryuuteis power i have been unable to fully unleash the queens potential beelzebubsamas special suggestion was this though promotion to queen increases overall power the combination with the sekiryuuteis power exceeds my current limits that is why i couldnt properly control the flow of dragon power overall what i got out of it was because there are suddenly more things to attend to it made me unable to adjust the distribution and flow of power properly sairaorgsan also seemed to understand the situation after a brief exchange it was true though the queen will amplify power greatly increase speed and power up dragon shoot but this does not automatically mean they can be controlled easily let alone the rook i havent even mastered the knight or the bishops powers even when my speed and demonic power increased i
often depended on charging straight ahead in the fury of the moment and this sometimes led to tragic resultsspeaking of the pawn its greatest characteristic was promotion so levelling up was the natural thing to do he said to me master the rook and the knight first to best bring out the sekiryuuteis power the best way to master the flow of power would be to focus on applying the sekiryuuteis power into the areas of strength and speed is that so which is why you used the rook against sairaorgsan ah yes compared to the queen it was much easier to control i could clearly feel the transmission of power into offense and defense i think i will first focus on each of the traits of the pieces and apply the sekiryuuteis power flexibly hearing that kiba laughed to suddenly test ideas out and sparring with sairaorgsan is really like your style isekun will become stronger again you really work hard towards exploring your own power even if i possess great power if i cant control it freely i wont be able to defeat sairaorgsan or vali so after watching the spar between sairaorgsan and me what do you
think to be honest for a devil from buchous generation to fight evenly with you on a pure contest of power and to dominate so overwhelmingly he is truly a great threat and with bare hands too amongst the young devils no all upper class devils sairaorgsan must be the only one who can destroy isekuns armor unarmed in fact my own defense would be like paper to him furthermore his speed was amazing and he clearly wasnt going all out not only me but all the other servants will be critically injured if they receive a direct hit from him that fellow gave his frank opinion as usual that is why i trust him so much after we get back from the trip lets start our training against sairaorg once again yes by the way could you let me know when you go buy souvenirs why because i think there is no meaning in trying to hide what you are buyingah i see got it then keep in touch on the last day having made these arrangements kiba got up from his seat and returned to the train car where his class was the conversations with xenovia and kiba
had ended asia and her group were happily chatting away the two idiots matsuda and motohama were going zzzz and fast asleep i stretched my back and closed my eyes there was still some time till we arrived in kyoto i decided to delve into the depths of the sacred gear ive done this numerous times already after the devils work when taking a bath also before sleeping every night plus on the weekends each time there was only one goal to talk to the past sekiryuutei seniors closing my eyes entrusting my consciousness to ddraig i dove into the depths of boosted gear leaving the darkness i arrived in a white space a vast pure white space on the various round tables and chairs the past sekiryuutei were sitting with their heads high with blank expressions on their faces greetings all its me again even if i tried to make conversation using this kind of cheerful manner they likely wouldnt respond though there was a youthful senior with a similar age and body build as me but no response either from above i heard the voice of ddraig amongst the past sekiryuutei he is closest to your age a
real genius who awakened juggernaut very early however he was drunk on power and was carelessly killed by another longinus wielder not the hakuryuukou when drunk on power they will rampage even if the opponent is not the hakuryuukou there are also others like that amongst the hakuryuukou juggernaut can allow a person to become a tyrant for a period of time but no matter what era tyrants will not prosper for long it is something that can not last this is the truth ddraigs tone of voice sounded like he was talking about himself after all he used to be drunk on power too still they must have things they treasured though his sekiryuutei seniors havent spoken a word but it must be true they were only swayed by power same for me if i were to feel like i was losing something precious i will seek power and this will activate juggernaut i who am about to awaken the two heavenly dragons that were taken the reason of ambition by god partner im not going to chant it all too horrifying its just something i dont understand what is the infinite and dream whatever i dont know and
what sneer and despise it was just as i raised questions about some key words in the juggernaut chant infinite refers to ophis while dream means great red sneering at ophis and despising great red who is also a red dragon its a mystery who came up with this chant i wonder if it was god himself a third voice i turned my face to find a young woman standing with long wavy blonde hair and a slim and trim body a beautiful lady wearing a full body dress with a high slit facial expressions she is different from all these past sekiryuutei full of smiles she looked at me elsha yes ddraig its been a while the lady casually greeted partner this is elsha foremost amongst the past sekiryuutei of all the female wielders she is definitely the strongest the strongest female sekiryuutei come to think of it i have never seen her before where did she come from your face is incredulous towards me amongst all the lingering memories there are only two exceptions i am one of them well even within the sacred gear i am hidden very deep so usually i dont come out here much
i thought you and belzard were never coming out again dont say something like that ddraig since belzard and i are always silently supporting you from the depths we used to be partners after all anyway he is going to lose his consciousness soon the lady showed a slightly lonely expression belzard seems to have taken an interest in the current sekiryuutei so i came by the way who is belzard ddraig answered my question he ranks up there with elsha belzard is the strongest male sekiryuutei truly a strong one he even defeated the hakuryuukou twice twice thats super amazing something like that can happen to occur twice in one life elshasan spoke again anyway i would like you to have this what she took out was a box with a keyhole you already received a key from the current beelzebub right eh eh smack suddenly with a flash of light a small key appeared in my hand without involving my conscious will the key popped out by itself was this the key received from beelzebubsamaelshasan smiled and said the socalled key isnt literal the box and keys are just metaphors to make things easier to understand what is
contained in this box are the delicate possibilities of the sekiryuutei originally it is something that can not be opened nor recklessly faced however belzard says perhaps you can do it of course because it is you who has received the evil pieces that is why we feel you will be able to do it suddenly elshasan began to laugh fufufufu oppai dragon chichiryutei i watched it with belzard together after coming to this place it was the first time him and i were able to laugh to our hearts content elshasan was laughing uncontrollably how embarrassing my seniors saw everything dont be shy and ddraig please dont get depressed lighten up a bit there has never been a sekiryuutei this fun to blow apart that ominous juggernaut chant the oppai dragon song really made belzard and me happy since whether it was belzard or i neither of us came to a proper end elshasan handed the box over to me so he and i we decided to believe in you i took the box and inserted the key into the keyhole a perfect fit it must have been made as a set you and the current hakuryuukou are unique
existences not only competing between the two of you but each having your own set of targets how should i put it it makes the rest of us look like fools please open it but remember to take responsibility and not give up halfway no matter what happens you must accept joyfully hearing elshasans words i turned the key with a click the box unlocked in that instant i was enveloped by a blinding light opening my eyes i was on the bullet train once more was that a dream ddraig no you did receive the box from elsha and opened it is that so then what was in the box no idea hey hey hey hmm i dont feel anything different about my body hows the sacred gear no change either however i noticed something flying out from the box whaaaaaaat i frantically searched around but found nothing what the heck did my possibilities just fly away if it disappeared like this that is no joking matter not only have i failed elshasan but i would be too ashamed to face azazelsensei and beelzebubsama again this was such a rare opportunity to receive aid dont worry it is something
that belongs to you it will surely come back to you your fate is in your hands even if you say that mmm oh oh oh oppai oooaah matsuda what are you doing this is mine what is so fun about a male chest sitting in front of me matsuda and motohama were wrestling with each other really who wants to get touchyfeely with idiots what the heck is going on ha what on earth am i doing this sudden urge for breasts and then matsuda has your breast deficiency reached such a level ok tonight we will be holding an ecchi dvd festival in the hotel room all the equipment is packed in the luggage really i heard it and couldnt help leaning over with interest what a great thing we can enjoy super ecchi dvds at the hoteloh oh ise thats right ok let us watch the titles i bought specifically for this trip peachy bursting breast scenery kinkakuji and fleshy gigantic busty flavors ginkakuji oh oh matsuda and i cheer loudly in response to motohamas announcement oh well if the contents of the box will return sooner or later then lets enjoy breasts first go die ecchi
trio so disgusting on the train these voices of the girls in my class ill just ignore them for now part 2 on the bullet train it was just as i finished enjoying the seaweed rice balls specially prepared by asia we are arriving at kyoto presently the announcement sounded oh oh were there as the bullet train stopped at the platform we took our luggage and got off its kyoto my first step in this much anticipated ancient capital as our eyes were drawn to the sights in the train station that we had never seen before kiryuu directed us to the ticket checkpoint the roof of the kyoto station was covered by a huge atrium inside the station were many automatic escalators it was truly a massive train station doesnt lose to tokyo at all as a major sightseeing destination it was natural that the ancient capital would have built a station on such a massive scale it was crowded totally packed itan a censored reference to the japanese department store isetan yes yes xenovia its itan xenovia and asias faces were full of excitement pointing their fingers everywhere commenting on every sight they were really happy i
really want to build a spectacular train station like this in heaven too irina on the other hand was amusing herself in another directionthe meeting point is the ground floor lobby of the hotel hey boys as well as asia and xenovia you two and irina who is daydreaming about the station if we dont get there as quickly as possible we wont have any time for free activities in the afternoon taking on the role of coordinator kiryuu yelled at us the boys trio as well as asias group assembling together kiryuu took out the travel guide and confirmed the locations hmm the hotel is quite near the station just now we exited from the west checkpoint walking in the direction of the bus station and then taking a right come on lets just go outside first hanging around in a train station wont get us anywhere as matsuda finished his words kiryuus glasses flashed with a chilling light matsuda getting lost in a strange environment is not fun one persons poor judgment can lead to many casualties is this a battlefield no matsuda kiryuus opinion is correct team work is important well let kiryuu lead from here who
knows if kyoto has begun to bare its fangs at us matsuda could only timidly nod and say i understand in response to xenovias persuasive warnings ah pervert a womans screams were heard in the station oppai a man was making fondling motions furiously but has been restrained by other male passersbys kyoto isnt that peaceful after all motohama exclaimed that was the truth perverts are present no matter where you gook got it lets go under kiryuus leadership we left the station and set off into the ancient capital ah its kyoto tower hearing matsudas exclamation everyone looked in that direction oh oh directly in front of the station was the tower so thats kyoto tower we were all planning to go up the tower on the last day matsuda that fellow immediately began taking out his camera to take photos it turned out the hotel was just a few minutes walk away it was also easy to find by following all the other students who wore the same winter uniform as us a few minutes distance from the station was a massive high class hotel its name was the kyoto sirzechs hotel looks like our maousamas name was
very influential even in the ancient capital as a side note also nearby was the kyoto serafall hotel under construction are you few trying to claim all the prime real estate around the kyoto train station maousama the hotel turned out to be run behind the scenes by the gremory family hence we were able to book rooms at very cheap rates after showing our student identification to the attendants at the entrance we were given detailed instructions to the lobby matsuda motohama and kiryuu were shocked by the luxurious decor of the hotel amazing is it really fine for the entire second year students to live in such a hotel matsuda expressed a very sensible opinion but this was no ordinary place the power and influence of the gremory family can not be underestimated on the other hand xenovia was much more calm yes its amazing but compared to buchous house its still a bit lacking it was true that one was a real authentic castle the reason why i wasnt shocked by the splendor of the hotel was because i had experiencedbuchous home already upper class devils they really were quite something going inwards a bit from the
waiting area we saw the entrance to the lobby in that vast and spacious lobby many of the kuou academy students had already gathered after the meeting time arrived each class began to take roll call and confirm their numbers everyone sat on the floor of the lobby while listening to the teachers announcements however azazel and rossweissesan seemed to be discussing something amongst themselves ah it was rossweissesans turn and she stood up in front of the students what will she be telling us to take note of there is a 100 yen shop in the underground shopping centre of kyoto if you need anything please go there you can never be too careful with your pocket money if you start being a big spender in your student years you will grow up into an unreliable adult money is what makes the world flow if you buy everything you want you will run out of money soon so please settle for the 100 yen shop the 100 yen shop is japans treasure the 100 yen shop what an enthusiastic speech and she already investigated the locations of all the 100 yen shops rossweissesan even though you have fulfilled your
basic needs through japans 100 yen shops you dont need to be that obsessed it looks like 100 yen shops have many qualities which the former valkyrie has fallen for admittedly they are quite cheap ah azazelsensei is facepalming the conversation with rossweissesan must have been terrible as rossweissesan hastily ended her speech another teacher came up and made final clarifications starting from day one rossweissesan was very popular with the students not only was she a beauty with a serious attitude but she also had an endearing cluelessness both male and female students loved her and called her rossweissechanplease take note of the above points after putting away your luggage in your rooms it is free activities until 5pm but please dont wander too far away best to stick to the area around the kyoto train station please be back to your rooms by 530 having heard all the final announcements yes the entire second year student body replied and thus we finished with the roll call in the lobby as well as various reminders about the hotel and the afternoon activities everyone took their luggage and received their keys from the attendants at the lobby entrance the rooms
were western style double bedrooms since i was the odd man out i get a room all to myself it will be great yyou see even on an outing teenage is a delicate time for boys and every day a certain something gets accumulated as i was thinking about that it was my turn to receive the key ise this is for you matsuda and the rest had already gotten their keys but i was the only one to receive it from azazelsensei azazelsensei was quietly laughing to himself i knew something was wrong but very soon i found out the answer the rooms the kuou students were staying in were spacious western style bedrooms for two with two massive beds and a full view of the scenery around kyoto station from the window amazing i once again feel thankful for getting into kuou academy matsuda cheered loudly while motohama was quietly touched this room was matsuda and motohamas then what was the remaining room for me like only my room was on a different floor i started to have a bad feeling two floors above the boys floor in the corner was a room that was clearly different from
the rest with a japanese style sliding dooropening it this is my room i was taken to a single room roughly the size of eight tatami mats i blinked an ancient television as well as a round table wasnt this minimum standard and why was everything so old and worn ah hahahahaha is this for real only this room is japanese style and looks like its only the size of eight tatami mats ah how fitting for ise no bed only sheets and only a single set are these the signs of resource allocation in the trip budget matsuda was bursting in laughter while motohama tried not to laugh as he calmly analyzed damn it why does it have to be me was that why because i felt it wasnt as luxurious as buchous home i am being punished toilet and bath at least they still had them but still its nowhere near as nice as those luxurious western style bedrooms tears gathered in my eyes at this time someone knocked isekun you have come here it was rossweissesan and wearing a tracksuit she changed huh i approached rossweissesan and whispered rossweissesan why on earth was i the only one
assigned to this room please endure it this room was prepared by riassan to make it easier for us to hold discussions discussions ah about devil related matters yes pretty much if anything happens in kyoto we needed to first secure a place to carry out discussions this is why the room was assigned to isekun who was the odd one out a room for us devils to hold meetings in kyotoso this room was the isolated japanese room which carried such purpose but still it doesnt have to be my room specifically after all i want to enjoy a luxurious western style hotel room on this school trip just like everyone else however since i dont want anything to happen while in kyoto it would be best if this room doesnt have to be used for those purposes please endure isekun as if lecturing rossweissesan placed her hand on my shoulder and said anyway i have to go meet with the other teachers so you are free from now i feel like there will be lots of trouble during the afternoon free activities period its not good for everyone to be mesmerized by kyoto yes the three of us
answered with great spirit now the first task is to locate azazel that man slipped away once the announcements in the lobby were finished because of this the governor of the grigori look asia its itan1 first are the maiko next i must have my fill of kyoto cuisine and planning such adult entertainment as expected of sensei he has already begun to move damn it i want to have happy times with the maiko too motohama took out a kyoto map and said to the dissatisfied me hey ise in the afternoon free period though it wasnt planned but lets go to fushimi inari3 fushimi inari ah true thats the place with lots of torii4 right i recalled the scenery i saw on television before the numerous red torii exactly its one stop away from the kyoto station just now i asked another teacher and he gave the ok eh if we already got teachers permission it would be nice to make a visit hearing my opinion matsuda rubbed his eyesif we miss any opportunity to tour the famous sights of kyoto then thats not really touring kyoto right then lets invite asia and the rest the two of
them quickly agreed to my suggestion yes if thats the case then let us visit inarisama for the afternoon this was the true beginning of our kyoto trip part 3 inari station was one stop away from the kyoto station and after getting off we were able to see the visiting road5 leading to fushimi inari hey look asia irina these shops have many interesting things to sell wa all these cute foxes do i have enough spare cash to buy souvenirs here having just arrived the church trio was already enjoying the kyoto atmosphere as asia and the rest chattered away they appeared to be no different from ordinary school girls the beautiful trio against a backdrop of kyoto scenery lets snap a photo from the side matsuda takes the opportunity to photograph them hey hey what about me kiryuu narrowed her eyes in protest passing through the last torii there was a huge door on each side was a fox sculpture resembling a stone lion exorcism statues normally they would have a presence that repelled existences like devils but thanks to the passes theres no trouble xenovia looked at the stone lionlike fox as she spoke are we
really under surveillancei spoke out about the sense of dissonance i felt ever since leaving the station just now thats right it felt like we were being watched yes of course we devils and angels are foreign existences to the authorities here though we notified them beforehand surveillance is still necessary well that makes sense ive heard about kyoto being the centre of japanese supernatural oddities from their point of view we are the outsiders with slight wariness we passed through the main entrance without issue walking further along we reached the main hall continuing we found the steps leading up the inari mountain we took photos as we advanced and began our next challenge of climbing the mountain path through a thousand torii we had been walking for tens of minutes hooo ha wwait wait for me wwhy are you all so energetic motohama was out of breath matsuda sighed as he spoke on the steps above hey hey motohama this is shameful even asiachan and the rest are fine since matsuda was actually quite athletic this level of exertion was nothing well we are devils after all so our base abilities are definitely higher than normal humans not
to mention we have been training so this sort of thing is a piece of cake as for me due to the summer training deep in the mountainous wilderness this level of exertion isnt even going to disrupt my breathing tanninossan i can climb this kind of mountain without any sense of fatigue i thanked the former dragon king who was now in the underworld we were checking out some little stores at the rest stop half way while continuing up the challenge that was inari mountain motohama was completely breathless at this point oh oh what a great viewyes too wonderful then take a photo by the way do the local schools in this area use this mountain path for running but looks like there are no runners today xenovia and asia were touched by the scenery of the fushimi inari mountainside while kiryuu showed her knowledge as she snapped photos of the view however there really were tons of red torii no matter how far we advanced written on them were the names of companies or shops they must have made offerings to the divinities at fushimi inari to make wishes ive always felt that if you visit
a mountain you have to reach the top that was what i learned from training in the mountains if you climb a mountain climb all the way to the peak something like that sorry im going to head to the top first i informed the others and then ran up the steps at full speed ah if i was still a human ascending this mountain would have killed me after becoming a devil and undergoing nonstop training this was so easy i tried as much as possible not to disturb the other tourists and continued up the steps and then i reached the peak at the top of the mountain was an old shrine yes this was the peak to be honest the path did branch off to other directions along the way there must be other places to visit due to the dense foliage there was barely any sunlight and i was surrounded by a slight shade the sound of rustling winds blowing through the trees it really felt deserted other than me there was not a single soul what should i do next let me pay respects to this shrine then head back down everyone else is probably
up here by now i faced the shrine and clapped my hands togetherlet me see and touch breasts all the time help me find a girlfriend help me do erotic things with buchou and akenosan as i finished this shameless but honest prayer and prepared to leave not from kyoto a voice was suddenly heard noticing the presences around me ah it seems like i was surrounded there were clearly many inhuman presences not very strong individually but they are numerous heh i didnt know i had already honed my sensing to such a degree anyway too bad i didnt sense anything until i was surrounded as i prepared a stance what appeared before me was a very cute short girl in a priestess outfit a girl her blonde hair shining both her irises were also golden colored looks to be the age of a young primary school student but clearly not human from the things on her head animal ears similar to konekos but did not feel like a cat that furry mass behind her must be the tail a dog youkai no since its fushimi inari it must be a fox by the way why did foxsama come
to me because im a devil but on the bus could the feeling of being watched be from these guys ha was my breastrelated wish forbidden just as i occupied myself with random thoughts the animaleared girl glared at me gnashing her teeth in rage and yelled outsider how dare you attackat the girls command out of the trees stepped many fellows with black wings and crow heads dressed like mountain hermits there are also some others with fox masks who dressed like priests oh oh oh what is this these are karasutengu6 foxes these first time opponents gave me quite a surprise without giving me a break the young girl pointed at me and yelled give my mother back the tengu and the fox priests began to attack i instantly materialized my gauntlet and dodged their attacks this level is not too hard to handle mmother what are you talking about i dont know who your mother is i roared at the girl i really dont know about her mother how could i know if i just arrived in kyoto however the girl does not seem to be listening dont lie my eyes can not be deceived i didnt
lie what the heck i just arrived in kyoto and this happens although i wanted to escape a tengus staff came smashing down upon me am i going to be hit just as i prepared myself clang the one who blocked the opponents staff was whats the matter ise what are these youkai xenovia and irina have arrived the two of them were carrying wooden swords they must have bought from the local specialty stores asia also hurried over a little later seeing the four of us gathered the young girl and her group showed surprise but instantly became even more angryis that so you all are the ones who my mother unforgivable unclean devils you have tainted this sacred place i will not forgive you no chance to talk at all her unilateral decisions were so vexing if thats the case leave it to me to endure such a situation asia do you have the thing you received from buchou yes hearing my question asia took out from her jacket a card etched with the gremory crest if anything happened in kyoto this identification card could substitute for the absent buchou and authorize me to promote asia had specifically
obtained the card from buchou before the trip the reason why asia was holding on to it was because it was best carried by someone who will stick with me throughout the trip its true asia and i will be together all the time during this school trip transform tthat queen though i wanted to but i had to familiarize myself to the other pieces through combat experience also fushimi inari was a famous sight it would be best not to use a piece that was too destructive buchou also reminded me listen well ise do not destroy kyoto even disregarding the other factions getting angry the devil world will also seek responsibility you have to treasure my beloved kyoto how can i damage buchous favorite place ok knight promotion as power flowed into my body it felt lighter if i just play hide and seek it wont damage fushimi inaritaisha right for now lets use thirty seconds worth of boost explosion the sacred gears power activated then its ok xenovia and irina were wielding wooden swords but those two can still cause destruction with just wooden weapons id better remind themxenovia irina though i havent figured out the situation
remember this is kyoto though they attacked unreasonably it would be bad if we hurt them or damaged the surroundings as much as possible just driving them away is fine understood the two of them immediately agreed whack the young girls companions attacked all at once xenovia and irina used their wooden swords to knock them down breaking their enemies weapons as they defeated them i also stood guard over asia as i rapidly dodged their attacks and kicked them away yes i xenovia and irina will defeat them hehehe i can feel the results of my training my movements are much faster than them by far to experience the knight through combat i must improve every day feeling they have lost the upper hand the attackers begin to retreat the girl glared hatefully at us and raised her hand retreat we dont have enough numbers to beat them damn evil existences i will make you give mother back leaving behind those words the girl and her followers disappeared like a gust of wind really what on earth just happened released from the state of battle we puzzled over why we would suddenly get attacked for some unknown reason kyoto
i felt a premonition that something unpleasant would happen part 4 the first night thanks for the mealwe had dinner at the hotel it was a luxurious feast of kyoto cuisine boiled tofu it was really delicious the tofu skin felt so tender and soft kyoto vegetables were also uncommonly tasty finally we could take a breather after the attack we quickly met up with matsuda and others as we finished touring fushimi inari while staying alert to our solemn attitude matsuda and the rest showed a puzzled expression after returning we reported to azazelsensei and rossweissesan the two of them were puzzled greatly why would we get attacked in kyoto this was the hardest point to understand the fact that we devils were visiting kyoto for a tour should have been informed to the rulers of this place beforehand sensei said he will confirm once again though i hesitated if i should report back to buchou i was deterred from doing so by sensei saying since we have not cleared up what happened exactly do not cause unnecessary worries for her true we had too little information to report to buchou by the way where did my possibilities go
after flying away from me id better report to sensei as well if they will return to you one day then waiting is a solution just be patient for the duration of the trip however i will ask some of my subordinates here to look out and report back for anything matching your description sensei replied yes yes to think so much has happened in kyoto after we just arrived then about these matters lets leave them to the superiors to handle finishing dinner i gathered with the pervert duo and the girls to talk about tomorrows schedule and then i went to hang out for a while in matsuda and motohamas room afterwards returning to my room i rested under the covers for a little more than ten minutes or soit was time i stood up and gently opened the door surveying the surroundings no one was around yes i swiftly left the room cautiously and opened the door to the emergency escape now was the time the public baths are in use peeking time these girls who always looked down on me kukukukuku let me savor your naked bodies as if licking them with my tongue i couldnt
help smiling my bursting desire drove me down the stairs at this time a figure stood guard on the platform linking the female bathroom to the emergency escape taking a good look it was rossweissesan she had been waiting for me in her tracksuit hoo i smiled with selfmockery they saw through my intentions after all my great peeking master plan from the very beginning we already knew you would come to the bathroom to peek rossweissesan prepared her stance as the teacher i will guard the girls naked bodies with my life i slowly descended the steps and spoke calmly rossweissesan even though we are teammates this is the only thing i can not compromise i must peek at the girls bathroom as we entered into each others range of attack we stopped stared at each other and ha smack smack rossweissesan and i began to battle on the fire escape since this was the hotel we can not use powerful attacks this was a battle of small scale magic and strikeswithout balance breaker i really have no confidence in beating rossweissesan in a serious battle however this was different since rossweissesan can not go all out with her
powerful magic within the hotel i materialized boosted gear and released several mini dragon shots to deflect rossweissesans ice magic huhuhu you can not use fire and explosive magic here even when dragon shot was broken through i could breathe fire from my mouth to melt these ice arrows instantly i am a dragon after all this kind of heat attack is within my ability hmph your attacks are strong as ever as long as its related to sex you can raise your power to this level how ridiculous if it allows me to witness the naked bodies of the girls in my grade i will gladly battle to the death with you today what level of pervertness is this you shouldnt you be satisfied with seeing and feeling riassan and akenosans naked bodies virtually every day that is that this is this what this perverted playboy dragon is hopeless really me a playboy from the very beginning i always felt like its the girls who played me around at home by the way even if you get past me there are the second year sitri girls guarding against you as a final resort we will even let saji awaken
the dragon king to obstruct you no matter what you will not peek into the girls bathroom how can this be such a defensive formation has been prepared looks like my plans to peek at the girls bathroom were seen through from the very beginning how reliable of rossweissesan and the sitri servants by the way letting saji transform into the dragon king to stop me from peeking how dangerous do they think i am to bring vritra to stop the sekiryuutei from peeking is that it come on cut me some slack if you dont loosen up you will never get a boyfriendhearing my words rossweissesan suddenly got very upset boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boyfriend is irrelevant after after after all i am still the virgin former valkyrie i also want to do erotic things with a handsome boyfriend with a promising future as rossweisse screamed her whole body started to give off magical power creak creak the emergency staircase was shaking violently oh no due to those stinging words the pressure from rossweissesan was expanding at an alarming rate her eyes full of tears i must have touched a forbidden switch at this
rate the staircase will be destroyed im going to die too if thats the case so be it i will use that to stop her i wont forgive you rossweissesan released lightning which zigzagged all across the emergency staircase barely dodging rossweisses magical attack i closed the distance still got shocked a bit but i must endure during this time i raised my imagination to the max concentrating demonic power in my mind yes let imagination become delusion and let stored power be released from the sacred gear explosion preparations complete i took off the top of my sports uniform and threw it forward obscuring her sight for an instant she wont know whats coming just this level rossweissesan used wind magic to blow away the clothing but an opening was created for an instant do not underestimate my lustful actions rossweissesan reacted to my fake out and as i brushed past her finally i touched her clothesfall apart dress break as i delivered magic into rossweissesans clothes they were blown apart instantly dress break success finally even rossweissesan has succumbed to this move oh oh what a great figure actually this is the first time i get to see
rossweissesans naked body those beautiful breasts make me so touched too amazing buchous breasts are quite beautiful too but whether it is the overall shape or the nipples rossweissesans breasts are excellent in every way beautiful legs combined with a narrow waist slim figure its like a work of art rossweissesan began to cry did i go too far ooh ooh sorry it was an accident against my apology rossweissesan cried with rage you think sorry solves anything tthat tracksuit was bought for 980 yen at a sale iit would take at least triple the price to replace it now the bra and panties were also bought at discount shes angry at that compared to being seen naked ruining clothes is more infuriating truly this was the cheap and nagging former valkyrie ah iyaaah ii cant get mmarried any more finally noticing rossweissesan covered her privates with her hands i dont know how to react to this total reversal of concernsyou only noticed now what do you mean only noticed now ruining clothes is such a waste your dress break is totally environmentally unfriendly on top of that your sex drive is too strong tissues also you must use tons
of tissues right as a teacher i can not forgive you for this please respect natural resources being lectured about respecting the items damaged by dress break this is totally the first time and about sex drives and warning me about using tissues well it is true for a high school boy at the peak of puberty tissues do get rossweissesan truly is a stingy no no a very environmentally friendly person a virgin valkyrie who loves to shop at 100 yen shops like a big sister one cant help but feel unfortunate for this is the first time ive been lectured about this im really sorry i apologize now that things have come to this it was no longer time to peek at the girls bathroom at this time a figure approached me it was ah sorry to disturb your fun at the climax my apologies azazelsensei his eyes half open shaking his head at the incredible scene before his eyes azazelsensei wwhy are you here oh weve been summoned to the nearby japanese restaurant summoned what is it theyre already at a nearby restaurant who is it sensei smiled at the corner of his lip at my question
the very cute maou shoujo sama part 5we the gremory group plus irina quietly slipped out of the hotel and followed azazelsensei to a restaurant on the street corner the dairaku restaurant so leviathansama is in this kind of place yes it looked like serafall leviathansama had entered kyoto we as well as sensei received leviathansamas invitation at this point passing through the path filled with traditional japanese atmosphere a single room appeared opening the door serafallsama was quietly waiting for us sitting in the seiza7 posture and wearing a glamorous kimono hello sekiryuuteichan and servants of riaschan its been a while leviathansama always greeted us with such joy and enthusiasm the kimono suited her very well her very long hair was tied up today to match the kimono oh its hyoudou and you guys saji and the other second year sitri girls they had come over first eh yeah saji hows kyoto where did you go in the afternoon were the student council we spent the whole afternoon helping the teachers saji sighed as he spoke that really was tough for them but as members of the student council it couldnt be helped still with the knight megurisan the
rook yurasan and the bishops hanakaisan and kusakasan there sure were a lot of pretty girl devils amongst the second years over there this makes sajis position as the only guy in the student council quite enviable the food here is really good especially the chicken dishes are exquisite sekiryuuteichan you and sajikun must really eat up we had hardly taken our seats when leviathansama immediately ordered more dishes like mad but we just ate dinner ah but then trying a piece in my mouth that delicious taste made me feel like i could eat as much as possible looks like everyone felt the sameso why has leviathansama come to this kind of place to my question leviathansama made a kiraboshi pose and replied i came here to secure the cooperation of the kyoto youkai forces as expected of the one in charge of foreign affairs she was doing her job dutifully so negotiating with the youkai forces but then leviathansama put down her chopsticks her cute face in a frown but it looks like there is an unusual situation an unusual situation to my question leviathansama replied according to reports from the kyoto youkai their leader the kyuubi has
gone missing a few days ago once i heard her words the days events flashed through my mind give mother back to me the young girls words clearly replayed in my mind wasnt the kyuubi the very famous ninetailed fox it appeared very often in manga and so that means presumably because she understood what i was about to say leviathansama nodded yes i heard your report from azazelchan i fear that is the situation azazel drank heavily and downed his alcohol then said so the leader of the youkai has been kidnapped the ones responsible most likely its khaos brigade leviathan concluded most solemnly has the terrorist organization come herethat animaleared girl the kyuubi girls mother has been kidnapped by them which is why we were mistaken for being part of the kidnappers and attacked you you guys what kind of trouble have you gotten mixed up in again sajis eyes began to twitch slightly sorry saji we are always getting into all sorts of trouble really taking care of these kids for the trip is already tiring enough how vexing these terrorists sensei spitted his words with contempt hey werent you going to have fun with the maiko
anyway leviathansama poured another cup for sensei and continued no matter what this situation can not be disclosed we must solve it ourselves i will continue to attempt to get the youkai to cooperate understood i will act alone really these terrorists bringing their trouble all the way to kyoto azazel downed another cup and cursed without a doubt it was due to these terrorists making him lose the opportunity to go play with the maiko it was just the first day of the trip and things have become so serious what were we supposed to do to be honest it could no longer be called a trip no no precisely because this is the precious school trip of high school students we must try as much as possible to enjoy the tour however since we were the gremory servants and devils we are compelled by the impulse to avoid inaction ummm so what we have to do is as i asked with apprehension sensei breathed out and forced a smile anyway you all should enjoy your trip eh but sensei began to rub my head with his handif anything happens i will call you guys however this is your
precious school trip right we adults will try to handle the situation as much as possible so you all go enjoy kyoto for now sensei senseis words made me feel deeply touched what a sly fellow the governor who always acted so slovenly was saying such cool words in this sort of situation yes sekiryuuteichan as well as sonachans servants please enjoy your time in kyoto i will also enjoy myself nothing more to say since leviathansama said so unexpectedly it looks like leviathansama is the one who wanted to enjoy kyoto the most since we didnt want to increase their burden we decided to continue our sightseeing tour and we cant even report to buchou but if anything happens i will take action i will protect the kyoto that buchou loveslife 3 the group of heroes has arrived part 1 good continue yes it was early morning on the second day of the trip the sky was just getting light asia and i were using the hotel roof for training to sum up we were training basic movements from start to finish asia would practice developing reflexes for releasing magical power at close range on the other hand i
repeatedly practiced my reactions and avoiding attacks fired at extremely close range plus basic training these practice sessions will continue until the day of the match they must be carried out day and night training no matter what i believed it was necessary to catch up to sairaorg and vali i will become strong even if it happened gradually step by step it was fine for this constant progression i had to train im sorry asia taking up your time to help me train even on the school trip i spoke as i breathed heavily asia shook her head no problem it makes me happy to be together with isesan in kyoto from early morning asia gave a radiant smile ah ah she was such a great girl asiachan is my most most most important asiachan i am so proud of her its more efficient to have a training partner right it was kibas voice taking a look not only kiba but xenovia was here as well since i already bought a wooden sword shouldnt we train ourselves to the degree of just barely not destroying this place the upcoming match with the heir of the great kings family will
be here soonxenovia i know you are having fun but are you planning on taking that wooden sword everywhere you go sightseeing but then again there seems to be no other way to defend against enemy attacks without destroying the tourist destinations as i was thinking that kiba created a short sword in his hand xenovia if anything happens just use this to fight ah a holy short sword with this it will be easy to conceal in the school bag thanks receiving the short sword from kiba xenovia twirled it around in her hands skillfully when kiba entered balance breaker he could not only create demonic swords but could also produce holy swords of a certain calibre however compared to legendary holy swords kibas were still quite lacking however enemies as my thoughts reached that point it made me feel demotivated even here a battle was likely to break out was it the power of the dragon that was attracting all this trouble i hated that possibility slapping my face i renewed my spirits i have to pull myself together yes let us have a good spar before the morning roll call and like that our morning training began
once again part 2 so kids lets go yes kiryuu flashed her eyes as she pointed at the bus station and we boys shouted in response though the first days incident was unfortunate but since sensei and the adults had already said so we must try to enjoy the sightseeing as much as possible i heard that saji and his group were also visiting various places today as wellthe second days activities started with taking a bus from near the kyoto train station to the stop at kiyomizudera8 we bought a one day bus pass at the kyoto station and then lined up for the bus with the other students we got on the bus and took it all the way to kiyomizudera as we looked out to appreciate the new scenery the bus reached its destination after some searching around we found the sloped path up to kiyomizudera oh those japanese houses built on both sides looked very interesting i heard this was called the three year slope if you fall over here it means you will die in three years eh kiryuu revealed oooh waaaaaa so scary asia was really terrified and hugged my arm eh eh eh
this was just a legend asia was a clumsy child and often fell over so it was natural for her to be afraid grabbing my arm should be a little safer but then xenovia too grabbed my other arm wwhat is it xenovia i asked in surprise but expressionless xenovia muttered to herself the japanese sure put some scary spells in their sloped paths she really believed it xenoviasan falling into such a misunderstanding however i think this is one of her cute points and so it came to be a situation where i was climbing up a slope with two beauties one on each arm during this time i could feel those two bastards glaring at me with pure hatred fufufu the appropriate amount of jealousy sure felt good at the end of the sloped path the massive gates appeared this was kiyomizudera passing through the entrance niou gates lets go to kiyomizudera look asia this temple gathers the essence of pagan culture yes yes you can feel its history from its appearancecheers to pagans in their excitement the church trio were making some very inappropriate comments you you guys kamisama and buddhasama are here i can feel them
watching so dont act too rudely ok this was the stage of kiyomizu ive seen on television looking down from there yes though it was very high but for the current me falling down shouldnt really be a problem why does my mind keep thinking of stuff like that not good battle related things seemed to have been carved into my bones there seems to be many who fell down and were saved kiryuu gave that explanation eh so even humans will be fine by the way people have fallen down from there within the temple there was a small shrine used for praying for passing grades and love wishes might as well put some loose change into the offering box and make a wish i am a student after all but since im a devil i have no idea to what extent buddhasama will be granting my wishes but still i do want to go to university hyoudou why dont you try the love compatibility prediction with asia at kiryuus urging asia and i drew a love prediction how was the compatibility it says highly favourable and auspicious looks like we are very compatible asia i summed up the
main content of the prediction and explained to asia her face turned red and she looked very happy yes i am so happy so happy really holding the fortune telling stick with great affection tears were flowing out of her eyes oh oh for her to be this happy it kind of makes me feel embarrassed but anyway let me thank buddhasama here for guaranteeing the relationship between asia and me i am so grateful i once again worshipped in prostration and paid respects to the buddha statuethis is great eh eh wonderful i feel a bit relieved xenovia irina and kiryuu were nodding their heads approvingly can you guys stop that its very embarrassing are we being left out dont cry matsuda let us simply beat up ise when we get back to the hotel ah the two boys were sulking gloomily in a dark corner we made a quick round of the temple bought some souvenirs and then walked to the bus station the next stop is ginkakuji9 the temple of the silver pavilion if we dont hurry time is going to fly away in the blink of an eye kiryuu led the way as she glanced at
her watch it was true without noticing it was already ten in the morning if we were to visit another two destinations it wont work unless we hurry as kiryuu said next is the ginkakuji boarding the bus towards there we left kiyomizudera its not actually silver reaching ginkakuji and seeing the temple those were xenovias first words no well its true that ginkakuji wasnt silver xenovia was unusually disappointed her mouth gaping wide open xenoviasans eyes were shining back when she kept saying to herself ginkakuji is made of silver and kinkakuji10 is made of gold they must be very dazzling asia hugged xenovias trembling shoulders and explained i see she had a great fantasyrumors abound such as the death of the monk ashikaga who was involved in building the temple or because the bakufu government ran out of money at the time anyway its not silver kiryuu explained man did this glasseswearing girl research everything beforehand to know so much about all the famous sights however the thought had already entered my mind at fushimi inari kyotos autumn scenery with all the mountains and trees was truly a beautiful sight its really great to have the school trip
during the fall season on the other hand will the winter scenery offer a totally different experience after making the rounds at ginkakuji we stopped for lunch nearby and continued to the next destination kinkakuji of course we also bought related souvenirs at ginkakuji gold this time it really is gold reaching kinkakuji the temple of the golden pavilion those were xenovias first words that she screamed completely different from just now she seemed very excited no it was extreme happiness its really gooooold xenovia raised both her arms her face full of radiance kinkakuji really is shining and golden so bright though ive seen it on television before but the real things glamour was overwhelming other students were also here and everyone was busy taking photos matsuda snapped photo after photo as if in a trance i also took some photos to commemorate then i texted it to the other members of the occult research club back at kuou academy we toured the place bought souvenirs and then stopped at a teahouse for a break please enjoy the kimonowearing lady prepared the powdered green tea and served it to us there were also some japanese snackstasting the tea it
wasnt as bitter as i imagined rather i should say savoring the tea along with the japanese snacks made the taste just right yes very good irina seemed to be enjoying it too its a little bitter asia was a little unaccustomed however she still drank it little by little so it shouldnt have been too bad for her it really is gold and shiny xenovia seemed to be in a dreamlike state and was still enamoured by the golden glamour of kinkakuji her eyes were shining with splendorous light and she did not even touch her tea todays xenovia really showed some rare sides never seen before its so interesting the one enjoying student life the most could very well be xenovia xenovia lets have a prayer to commemorate xenovia nodded at irinas suggestion good idea lets pray asia joined in and the three of them went oh lord as the trio prayed towards the heavens what the heck kind of commemoration is this ah it was already after two in the afternoon though weve already toured the sightseeing spots at a rapid pace once things caught our eyes time seemed to pass so quickly come to think of
it we already went to sound the bell immediately after entering kinkakuji but i guess the long lines took longer than expected ah pervert hentai a female voice with great surprise i looked around to find a man being stopped by some staff opoppai give me oppaieven kinkakuji had molesters man it sure ruins the sightseeing mood another molester now that its mentioned the television news this morning also reported about them there was one at the sensoji shrine too and at the train station yesterday there seems to be a bit too many molesters to matsudas words motohama pushed his glasses and protested what are you talking about youre the one who attacked me on the bullet train yesterday so thats what happened yesterday no how should i explain it at that time i must have been groggy in my sleep but i suddenly felt an urge to touch nipples what was going on that feeling matsuda tilted his head puzzled well i believe as a man wanting to touch breasts is a normal thing this is youth motohama declared and matsuda goes the mistakes of youth and nods but then again please give up on the male nipples
as i was about to nod along with them my cellphone rang ah it was akenosan calling what was the matter yes hello is there anything wrong akenosan hello isekun no nothing serious just now konekochan just brought up some concerns concerns yes you just sent those photos right yes the ones at kinkakuji is there a problem akenosan replied to my surprise on that photo it looks like you caught something caught something yes in the background scenery there seems to be a few fox youkai what is going on although fox youkai are not that rare in kyoto akenosans voice was somewhat worried having received her call i felt a chill no we are fine ah asia seems to be calling me lets talk later if anything happens contact me yes i hung up after that being called by asia was a lie checking those photos from just now they looked just like normal scenery from kinkakuji i couldnt see anything was it something like those paranormal photos only special people can see after all only a nekomata konekochan could see them anyway let me alert asia and the rest about akenosans information looking back at the teahouse
matsuda motohama and kiryuu were fast asleep it cant be because they were too tired its impossible that they fell asleep within the time i took the call asia and the rest were awake but xenovia was glaring at the waitress with a scary expression she has revealed her animal ears and tail not human taking a look more of those animal eared guys have appeared and all the normal tourists are asleep hahaha it was too naive of us to think that they would not attack at a famous sightseeing tourist destination was kinkakuji part of youkai territory xenovia quickly extracted the short holy blade from her bag and hid asia behind her i readied my left hand and was about to summon the gauntlet please wait hearing a familiar voice i glanced over appearing was rossweissesan rossweissesan why are you herepanting rossweissesan answered yes i was called by azazelsensei to welcome you guys called by sensei what happened i asked as i surveyed the surroundings thinking about it there was a lack of enmity different from the youkai who attacked us yesterday a ceasefire or in other words the misunderstanding has been cleared the kyuubis daughter wants to
apologise to you all thus answered rossweissesan ah a ceasefire misunderstanding cleared then in other words no more foxes will be attacking to my lingering doubts an animaleared lady approached and bowed her head deeply i am the fox youkai who serves the monarch of the kyuubi we are most sorry for last time please come with us as our princess would like to apologise to you all come with them to where just as i thought that the fox youkai oneesama continued to speak to the inner capital where we kyoto youkai live maousama and the fallen angel governor are already there part 3 what we stepped into was a place that can only be described as another world like the streets of the edo period ancient houses were lined up and strange creatures revealed their faces from the doors windows and passageways through a secluded torii at kinkakuji we passed through there and entered a different world a dark space with a unique atmosphere those creatures i just mentioned the many residents welcomed us a singleeyed youkai with a largeface kappalike youkai with dishes on their head tanuki walking upright and other creatures from legend everyone was watching
us with curiosity we followed the fox lady towards the princess residence it was rather dark and the only light source was a lamp moving along the road in front of us wooshashshasha wa scared me the lantern suddenly showed eyes and a mouth and began laughing was it the legendary lantern beast my apologies the youkai here love to play pranks though i suppose none of them are able to pose a threat to you all the fox lady guiding us apologised as we walked this is the world of the youkai this was my question though i realised that this space was connected to kyoto fox oneesama gave the following answer yes this is the place where most kyoto youkai live i remember you devils have used bounded fields in the rating game so why dont you think of this space as something created in a similar way we call this place the backstreets or the inner capital and other names of course just like devils there are those who live out there on the surface of kyoto the inner capital i see something similar to the game fields of the devils are they human no ive heard
that theyre devils devils eh how rare to see them here is that pretty foreign girl a devil too a dragon that must be a dragons presence devils and dragons from the gossiping of the youkai could be heard devils must be rare here true this was youkai territory after all it was naturalpassing through rows of residences we entered a forest with a river flowing through it venturing deeper a massive red torri appeared before us was a huge mansion giving off a feeling of ancient majesty ah in front of the torii azazelsensei and leviathansama in a kimono were already there oh you have arrived ah hello everyone even though they have come to the youkai world both of them acted the same between them was a blonde girl the one who led the earlier attack should i just call her kyuubisan instead of a priestess outfit this time she was wearing a fancy feathery kimono like a princess from the warring states era ah she really looked like a little princess kunousama i have brought everyone here the fox lady reported then disappeared in a burst of fire was that it the socalled fox fire the princess
stepped forward and began to speak i am kunou the daughter of yasaka the administrator of the youkai living in inner and outer kyoto after her self introduction she bowed her head deeply i am really sorry for last time attacking you without investigating deeply please forgive me so she is apologising to us i showed a troubled expression and scratched my face its fine isnt it great that the misunderstanding is cleared i dont mind as long as we get to enjoy our trip in kyoto without further incident xenovia said so she probably had no wish to fight in kyotoyes a heart of forgiveness is very important for angels i have no grudge against princesssama irina followed up asia also spoke full of smiles yes peace is very important since the three of them already spoke i had no reason to disagree by the way to let everyone else say everything there was to say that was really shameful for me as a man so thats how we feel im fine too please lift your head but but hmm that incident actually troubled her more than us i knelt down and made level eye contact with the young
girl kunou so youre called kunou right i say kunou youre really worried about your mother right yes of course if thats the case then making a mistake is understandable of course this could cause problems and make it unpleasant for others but kunou you have already apologised you apologised because you understand you were mistaken is that right of course i placed my hand on her shoulder and smiled continuing if thats the case we wont blame kunou hearing my words kunous face went red and spoke in a timid voice thank you ok misunderstanding cleared i stood up but azazelsensei gave me a poke as befitting the oppai dragon you sure have a way with kids please please dont joke around i put a lot of thought into it dont be shy youre living up to the name of the oppai dragonyes truly the oppai dragon i am so touched really this guy is so great with kids towards me who was feeling embarrassed xenovia asia and irina were nodding their heads and giving praise you really surprised me there as a teacher i am proud of you even rossweissesans impression has improved a bit how bad was
her initial impression if i could strike a conversation about 100 yen shops perhaps her opinion of me will go up ii wont lose the oppai dragon is promoting itself even in such a place my television show miracle levitan wont lose leviathansama seemed to be all fired up with some kind of strange oppositional impulse really these devils are too peaceful very embarrassed kunou spoke though i am very sorry for my mistake but please i beg you all please lend your strength to save my mother the painful cry for help from a young girl the leader of the youkai in kyoto was the kyuubi11 yasaka she left her house a few days ago to meet with sakras messengers from mount meru however yasakasan failed to show up at the meeting place the youkai began to investigate and discovered one of her dying guards the karasutengu on his last breath the karasutengu told the other youkai that yasakasan had been attacked and kidnapped it was at that time they started investigating suspicious newcomers and attacked our group afterwards azazel and leviathan negotiated with kunou denying underworld involvement as well as providing clues that it was likely the work
of the khaos brigade seems like things have become serious after hearing everything about this incident that was my opinionwe had been taken into the mansion in the great hall kunou had taken her seat sigh once the various factions decided to ally this kind of thing has been happening last time with odin loki came right this time the enemies are the terrorists sensei complained unhappily sensei who hoped for peace will definitely not forgive these terrorists i think he must be full of righteous fury on kunous side were the fox lady from before and a long nosed old man the old man was the leader of the tengu and had a deep relationship with the kyuubi since ancient times he looked sincerely worried about the kidnapped yasakasan as well as her daughter kunou governordono maoudono could you help find a way to save yasakahime no matter what we pledge our full cooperation the old tengu made such a request he handed over a portrait for us to look at a beautiful blonde oneesama in a priestess outfit animal ears upright on her head ccould it be this is the portrait of yasakahime really arent these breasts massive
it is something clearly visible despite the miko outfit what do these terrorists want to do with such a busty fox princess iif you do anything shameless i will not forgive you all what we can be certain of is that the kidnappers are still in kyoto sensei spoke why do you think so that was my question sensei nodded and explained the flow of ki in all the regions of kyoto is still stable the ninetailed fox is an existence responsible for maintaining the balance of ki flowing from the different areas of this land kyoto itself can be considered a large scale force field if the kyuubi left this land or was killed then kyoto will undergo dramatic changes since there are no signs of that it means yasakahime is still fine and the kidnappers are likely still around kkyoto was a city like that these were all surprising revelationshowever if yasakasan was fine then the chances of saving her were quite good serafall what level of investigations have the devils over there been undertaking ive ordered them to investigate in detail devils familiar with kyoto have also been mobilised sensei shifted his gaze and looked at each
of us looks like this time you guys will likely be involved due to the lack of manpower especially since you are experienced in fighting strong beings and we will be needing your power against the hero faction its a shame but please be prepared for the worst i will be responsible for contacting kiba and the sitri servants who are not here before that please continue to enjoy your trip but we will be counting on you in an emergency yes we agreed to senseis words in the end it was no longer a simple trip well covering all those wonderful destinations was a smart decision kunou placed her palms together and bowed her head deeply the fox lady and the old tengu also bowed with her i beg you all please please lend your power to save my mother no please lend your power to me i beg you such a young child bowing her head and begging in tears with a trembling voice though she spoke like an upper class princess she must still be at an age where she still relied on her mothers affections the fury in my heart overflowed these khaos brigade bastards though
i dont know what you are planning i will get you to kidnap such a busty oneesama unforgivable and then i thought when we save yasakasan she must surely give me some kind of rewardufufu you are the sekiryuutei you saved me wonderful lets see how should i reward you hmm youre staring at my body is that so you want my body ufufufu no problem let me bring you to the utmost ecstasy drip drip as erotic delusions filled my mind blood flowed from my nose seductively opening her kimono the image of the kyubi oneesama became incredible breasts breasts isesan could you be thinking erotic things right now asia was looking at me very much displeased asiachan in these areas your instincts are sometimes very sharp i shook my head no way no way this is the little princess request with that frame of mind i renewed my determination and prepared myself for battle during this trip but then where have my possibilities escaped to there have been no signs of them returning so far were they still in kyoto but somehow they felt like they were not far away wow it was such a sumptuous feast that
night i was lying on the sheets in my room having finished dinner and taken a bath buffets were truly the best and everything looked so high class having experienced the youkai world we returned to kinkakuji once again waking matsuda and the rest who were sleeping we continued our tour buying souvenirs we spent our time in that area until it was time to get back returning to the hotel we met up with kiba and the sitri servants to plan the next step we will continue touring as planned for tomorrow but will bring along portable versions of transfer magic circles so that we could return to the hotel immediately once we received news from our leader azazelsensei we must return to the hotel immediatelyhonestly this really kills the sightseeing mood tomorrow we were planning on visiting the storm mountain arashiyama12 and it looks like kunou will meet us there as our guide it seems like kunou wanted to apologise by being our tour guide originally we were about to decline but she insisted it was fine since she wanted to do it no matter what we could only accept her offer however it was actually sensei who
told us to accept first something about this being the first step in the cooperation of the underworld with the youkai the daughter of the youkai leader was a super vip and so the mission was handed over to us tomorrow we must make sure nothing embarrassing is done i wonder what buchou is doing right now akenosan as well as konekochan ah and gasper too i missed the members of the club who stayed behind at kuou academy they likely never imagined we would get involved with khaos brigade but too bad this incident is still under wraps mmm how i miss buchous breasts when i get back i must bury myself in her bosom how should i pass this time before i go to sleep matsuda and motohama seemed to have gone something about peeking at the girls bathroom im not going this time but then again it might be fun to challenge rossweissesan and the entire sitri defense team hmm what should i do as i pondered whether or not to peek at the girls bathroom knock knock someone was knocking at the door im in answering the door ise its me it was asias voice whats
up come inasia entered she was wearing just a nightgown so whats up asia i came to play xenovia and irina are coming shortly as well kiryuu said she was busy gossiping with the girls from other classes so shes not coming really three beautiful girls coming to my room to play this is wonderful what should we do yes yes strip rockpaperscissors hehehe those kinds are activities are perfect for these situations as i made perverted plans ise were going to be discovered it was matsuda and motohamas voices from the corridor are they going to enter my room aasia this way eh iise for some reason i suddenly didnt want to be seen by those two bastards and pulled the puzzled asia into the closet closing the sliding door from within i raised my finger and went shhhh in the dim light to tell asia to be quiet after a while matsuda and motohama opened the door and their footsteps entering the room could be heard ah ises not here could it be that guy knows the same old place we are going to peek at the girls bathroom what thats bad is he going to savor the
female body before us ah it must be lets go matsuda yes thud thud those were the sounds of rapid and imposing footsteps as they raced out of the room the two of them seemed to have lefti say same old place to peek at the girls bathroom what was that supposed to be that kind of place actually existed damn it i mind very much what was that about as i wracked my brain over their words just now asia suddenly grabbed my arm tightly i turned back to look at asia she looked like she had something to say and then she seemed to make a decision and spoke ise when you were with rias oneesama at the tokyo train station platform you kissed right ddid she see it did she realise something returned to the platform and witnessed it by accident no matter what it seemed like asia saw that scene ah it was a goodbye kiss ii see to kiss so intimately true ise and rias oneesama are but i am also asia looked straight at me her expression had a certain seductiveness can you give me a kiss too as she finished her words asias
face drew near second kiss naturally our lips came together most naturally with neither lust nor pretense this kiss only communicated our care for each other in the instant the lips pressed together full of tender loving care a frightening sense of reality surrounded me that feeling truly impressed upon me how important asia was to me how so very precious asia my asia we must be together forever be it hundreds thousands ten thousand years later we must be together as i immersed myself in the romantic atmosphere the door openedah yaya umm xenxenovia come look quickly her hair let down and wearing her nightgown irina had pulled open the door and we started staring at each other what is it irina ooooh this is asias precious kissing moment asia so this is what you meant by coming to play in ises room i am impressed the one speaking was xenovia also in her sleepwear asia and i were kissing right in front of them what is this how did they enter without making a sound thats right asia said they were coming shortly too careless too many openings in a moment of impulse they saw they saw everything
clearly when asia and i were kissing i frantically separated my lips with asia damn saliva is dripping out what timing tongues tongues were about to entangle when the closet door opened looks like its not the first time hmm asia is always ahead of me yes yes asia is sometimes very daring and advancing rapidly in this area xenovia and irina seemed to be discussing the matter with great interest so excited that their faces are red bang something seems to have exploded asias face was red to the limit ah ah wa ahahahahahahahah fuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu ah asias eyes were spinning around out of sheer embarrassment and then she fell down unconscious asia hey asia pull yourself together you have me to share your embarrassment however this is the kind of situation asia couldnt possibly withstand sorry to disturbsame here as i attended to asia xenovia and irina entered the closet as well and then carefully slid close the door from inside sorry we came to your room to play but you seemed to be absent so we opened the closet xenovia calmly explained as if it was perfectly reasonable my room was supposed to be used for emergencies but
who knew this kind of emergency situation would arise xenovia slowly approachedwwhat are you doing xenovia xenovia showed nonchalance at my surprise and replied i am after asia is it going to be a kiss or something sexier next is irina what what are you saying how did it come to this eh me too you must be joking irinas eyes were popping out in surprise at xenovias words she also seemed to have been caught up in something beyond her comprehension this is a great opportunity irina you should use it to understand men understand wont that make me a fallen angel well you must overcome this with spirit perhaps you wont change into one after all use spirit yes yes it must be like that but but if if i do something vulgar how can i as michaelsamas ace softly murmuring to herself irina seemed to be struggling with herself ise is a great choice a good man and also the sekiryuutei if you bear the child of the legendary dragon perhaps it may contribute to heavens battle potential in the future isessekiryuuteis child heavens battle potential aaaaaaaah irina began to agonise after all was that it did
the meaning of my existence lie there ok how should we do this in this narrow space we have one man and three women hey hey xenovia what about the teachers outside yes they forbid male to female contact who knows what they might do if they discover young men and women alone in one room the boys and girls rooms were separated by floors and the teachers have been keeping watch strictly even during the free activities period before bed time they made rounds checking the rooms it would be bad for them to find a situation like thisah you mean the male teachers we already used our angel and devil powers to seal this room in a barrier nothing will happen no matter who approaches no problem even if moans come from this room no one will enter i didnt quite understand but this space is currently filled with sacred and demonic magic xenovia and irina were making a thumbsup sign are you idiots these children are truly idiots the church duo who misplaced their initiative in such matters as i harshly criticised these twos crazy antics xenovia closed the distance between her and i ok first lets
start with kissing hmmm i dont know why but xenovias lips are especially sexy today perhaps its because of the kiss just now with asia and my heart hasnt calmed down eh xenovia youre already going to kiss irina seemed unprepared yes i have to practice making babies with ise didnt kiryuu say that doing this on a trip feels extra special kiryuu that damn pervert didnt i tell you not to fill these guys brains with such useless information but then again thank you what would happen with xenovia if this continues will i finally have sex that thats right this is important but i am an angel as well as michaelsamas subordinate a christian this this kind of thing then you can just watch from the side i will be making babies under the gaze of an angel hohoho doesnt this feel like making a child chosen by heaven irina you can watch the precious scene of devils making babies please grant this scene your holy blessing if you can xenovia began to strip her skin was slowly being revealed those perfect curves always steal my heart whenever they appear we are devils so we can see clearly
in the dark it must be like that everything is so clearhearing xenovias words irina revealed her angelic wings and halo the brightness further intensified the atmosphere how convenient the power of angels please leave this to me i have always wanted to witness like gabrielsama the mysterious moment when life comes into being ah ah this also pertains to the three factions to heaven and to faith in the lord plop xenovia had removed her bra uuwaaa nosebleed this damn fellow has breasts bastard xenovia made no notice of the unconscious asia and embraced me ah ah ah ah ah the feeling of breasts is transmitted to my body the softness is making my brain go numb this is a rare opportunity you must also hug her like this when asia wakes up since its the first time for you and asia it might be tragic if you are unskilled learn about women through me and then embrace asia with that knowledge this is for asias safety ah ah xenovia you are so selfsacrificing what the heck are these two saying xenovia removed my clothing while she caressed my body so stimulating and and pressing my hand in between
her thighs that smooth soft feeling is making my mind blank ahh truly a mans skin your skin makes me feel so good touching you really makes me feel like a woman drip drip nosebleed can not be stopped this this girl can naturally kill men with only words at at this rate what can i do but accept this something huge is going to happen with xenovia and asia in this very closet i swallowed hard adjusted my breathing and reached out to embrace xenovia oooo mmmm eh iasia woke up sitting up slowly just as i was about to lie down with xenovia our eyes met watching us asias eyes stared wide open oh asia youre awake i was just about to extract some genetic material from ise here xenovia was completely nonchalant ggenetic material yyou what are you saying gene gene gene genetic material asias voice was shrill just a little bit relax i wont take it all perhaps i might get pregnant after a few rounds of extraction xenovia speak a little more like a lady please those are some unusual words you no no way ises not allowed asia pouted tearfully come on whats the
matter with sharing a bit with me xenovia raised an eyebrow a little angry the two began to fight no no thats not the issue but to extract it then then you need to do that with ise not allowed asia youre surprisingly knowledgeable youve graduated from believing storks delivered babies you you dont go looking down on me i understand everything if you want it that much i will announce it right now hugging me asia loudly shouted i want to bear ises child in an instant xenovia irina and i were all shocked by asias daring declaration and not to mention she was taking off her nightgown skin as white as snow was being revealedin a second my nosebleed began flowing audibly oof course because asia actually said she wants wants wants to have my child i know my own face must be red to the extreme amazing this is the battle between women for genetic material how amazing irina watched us nervously shut up arent you an angel ise since we are to be together forever isnt it natural to have children asia asked me i have lost all judgment and answered weakly is is that so
is that so ok xenovia i will have ises babies i will have many many babies xenovia grabbed my arm her brbreasts are resting on my arm no if its like that then you must give me a round of genetic material i want children too i am a woman as well and want the experience of having a child i also want to experience raising a child what what kind of development is this i am very happy but what is this suffocating feeling this closet is not only narrow but the air is getting thin the current situation is so similar to buchou asia akenosan and konekochan in my room fighting that night before the trip girls are too incomprehensible xenovia and asia were glaring at each other i extracted myself away from them hoping to distance myself but hit my head on a wooden panel with a loud sound ouch this is too cramped what have i bumped into as i fell forwards my hand landed on a supremely soft feeling wa i isekun in front of my eyes was irina with her face all red as i fell upon irina my posture is now on top
of irina i glanced down her night gown is open her pure white breasts clearly open to view wow so big irinas are quite big too amazing these are an angels nipples soft tender tips expanding by the way my hand is currently busy fondling one of her breaststhis happened by accident because the closet space is so small irinas breast was so soft yet elastic that feeling of the entire hand sinking into the breast that soft quivering but elastic feeling like a newly set pudding softness and tenderness completely rivaled akenosan irina ah the angels wings were flickering again was she close to the dangerous edge of falling again i this is the first time so i dont know what to do isekun you do you want me to become fallen irinas face was full of uncharacteristic feminine charm this wont do the normally cute and naive irina showing such an expression is too powerful it is making some massive power run around within my whole body plus her hair was let down this multiplied seductiveness many times ssorry i tried to apologise and remove my hand ouch i hit my head on the wooden panel again my
face fell down from the impact of course that was where irinas breasts that sensation of supreme elasticity was passing along to my face ah ah irinas breasts are so large and soft and smooth is this how it feels to embrace an angel my vision was getting fuzzy and so was my consciousness i must have hit my head too hard plus this unending nosebleed all this time ise are you ok ise hey getting knocked out by embracing irina for the first time i can not personally accept that i am going to be fallen ah ah lord please forgive me the three voices begin to trail off the church trio their cooperative battle power was truly a scary sightpart 4 the next day we set off from the hotel to kyoto station ah last night was just so i felt like i was still in a dream state and havent woken up last night i experienced all sorts of erotic things with the church trio in the closet it was an ecstatic situation but at the same time quite suffocating after passing out from the massive blood loss and hitting my head multiple times i woke to
find myself under the blankets in the morning apparently rossweissesan had come along and sent the church trio back to their rooms and had taken care of me rossweissesan sure is great at taking care of people however hearing asia declaring i want babies really gave me quite a fright last night but it really makes me happy from the very depths of my heart though it felt really complicated i am truly touched every time something like this happened to me i would think how should i put it i am always faltering at critical moments i am well aware of it but i just cant take the next step forward binding me it must be that traumatic experience in the depths of my heart every time i wondered if taking the next step might make the girls dislike me i would become deathly afraid current life is the best which is why i dont want to destroy the current situation harem king is impossible if this continues that i also know but if thats the case the relationship with buchou will never impossible to reach oh well that is fine for buchou i will always perhaps if there
is a chance i might take the courage to make that step forward next round if we win against sairaorgsan then with buchou i can hey ise why do you look like youre cryingmatsuda poked his face in front of me and questioned ah its its nothing but you and motohamas faces are truly terrifying nothing much these are wounds of honor matsuda and motohamas faces were swollen and covered with plenty of bandaids the two of them went to some socalled same old place to peek at the female bathroom but the student council the sitri servants had already staked out the area yet the two of them still tried to force their way in hence their bruised and battered faces they had no chance against the sitri girls afterwards even i became a suspect but thanks to rossweissesan coming to my room i had proof of absence but then again this morning the church trio and i were summoned by rossweissesan for a lecture rossweissesan truly was like a great older sister to us sorry for bringing you trouble by the way how did i get lumped into the activities of those two idiots i cant help it
when we are known as the perverted trio do i have no credibility because i always look so perverted anyway lets stop these thoughts so i need pull myself together and continue sightseeing today we are taking on arashiyama and the first place is the heavenly dragon temple tenryuuji13 how do we get to tenryuuji i asked kiryuu she looked at the schedule and replied yes take the one from the kyoto station towards arashiyama then get off at the closest stop to arashiyama then walk in that direction got it then were going to the station now buchou mentioned it before but there really are buses and streetcars everywhereso all the sightseeing spots are these kinds of places matsuda heard my comment and spoke it was true it was all like this at kyoto station we got on the streetcar towards arashiyama and headed to the destination this is it after getting off we had to walk to tenryuuji there were signs so it was impossible to get lost and so we finally arrived at tenryuuji the elegant gates greeted us this is tenryuuji so does the name have any special significance who knows perhaps we once fought a
battle here perhaps not ddraig perhaps his memories were fuzzy even if they had fought here it must have been eons ago and the scenery would be completely different from now it was probably natural to forget we had entered the massive gates and were paying the entrance fee hello you bunch came along it was the young voice ive heard before turning my head i saw behind us the blonde girl in a priestess outfit kunou its kunou yes as agreed i will be your tour guide for the surroundings of arashiyama today she had her ears and tail hidden of course because there were normal humans all around us matsuda and motohama were surprised to see the cute little blonde loli wow what a cute girl hey ise you went and hit on a little kid just like that how rude of this baldy we went through a lot you know on the other hand motohama so loli really adorable hahahis breathing was becoming a little irregular i forgot this guy is an incurable lolicon kunous type was right up his alley motohamas eye glasses were giving off a dangerous light however someone pushed motohama aside and hugged
kunou its kiryuu ah so cute hyoudou how did you meet hugging and rubbing their faces together kiryuu you like lolis too let let go of me dont act so familiar you lowly girl kunou was very reluctant but kiryuu got even more excited protesting using a princess manner of speech is the best what a perfect image hopeless this glasses girl sighing i pulled kiryuu away from kunous body and continued the conversation this is kunou she already knows me and asia and the others i am kunou pleased to meet you kunou was surprisingly serious what a princess her attitude carried a certain air of nonchalance ah you know gremorysenpai ive heard that the hotel is related to the company that senpais parents manage something like that kiryuus quick conclusions were useful for once this way i dont have to explain too much so kunou you said you will be our tour guide what are we going to be doing kunou proudly puffed out her chest and spoke with confidence i will accompany you all and tour these famous sights so i see then i should be honoredwhatever this counted as a kind of cultural interaction after all
then first show us around this tenryuuji of course with that said kunou showed a bright and happy smile and so under kunous lead we toured tenryuuji kunou confidently related stories she heard from others and tried very hard to present them to us it made her extremely adorable at the same time it was comforting to see her trying her best to describe the various places in kyoto the garden inside the large abbey was very beautiful decorated by the red leaves of autumn the japanese style gardens shades of the fall season was quite intoxicating the carp swimming in the pool was an excellent touch that completed this scene this view is extremely good after all its a world heritage site kunou explained world heritage amazing so thats why its so pretty let me snap a picture with my phone after touring the garden we were taken to the teaching hall entering i lifted my head to look at the ceiling instantly a most spectacular dragon design came into view an eastern dragon with a long slender body the dragon felt like it was glaring at me with a frightening gaze this is the famous unryuuzu or image
of the cloud dragon no matter which direction you will feel like the dragon is staring straight at you its the socalled watching the six directions it was exactly as kunou described no matter which way you look at it the dragon was staring straight at us cough amazing say ddraig do all eastern dragons give off such a feeling yes they are mostly like that this reminds me of the dragon king yulong the jade dragon so the jade dragon is like that eastern dragons are different from the western ones rather than being scary they have a more mysterious aura to them unfortunately photos were forbidden at the unryuuzu and i couldnt snap a shot after touring tenryuuji we went outside kunou where are we going next i asked kunou pointed to a good many directions and happily said nisonin14 the bamboo path jojakkoji15 i will take you everywhere oh how full of spirit now youre really acting your age and so under kunous lead we continued to tour around arashiyama part 5 wow we really visited a lot of places matsuda let loose a sigh of relief we were having lunch at a tofu hotpot place recommended
by kunou after leaving tenryuuji kunou took us on a tour around arashiyama seeing siddhartha gautama and amitbhas buddha statues worshiped at nisonin riding the rickshaws through the bamboo path hearing the sound of wind rushing through the bamboo leaves was very elegant it was the first time for me to ride a rickshaw it was very fun the person who pulled the rickshaw was very talkative and described the scenery as we went along watching arashiyamas scenery from a rickshaw was one of the best experiences ah it is really great that autumn came i say the tofu hotpot here is quite a delicacy kunou fished tofu out of the pot with her chopsticks and distributed them on to our plates haha even during meals you like to act like a host kunou seemed very happy this must be her usual smile precisely because of this it was heartbreaking to see her begging us to save her mother if only we could bring your mother back soonerthe tofu kunou gave to me had to be eaten straight away hmm kyoto tofu was very fragrant and this was even better than the hotel ive heard that tofu is best eaten
freshly made looks like this was made just now this has a very japanese flavor nice yes its different from the usual tofu its taste is very fresh and delicious this tofu is good xenovia asia and irinas faces were full of joy carelessly my gaze met with irina irinas face went red this had been happening all day it was definitely because of last night it was only natural something like that must be a major incident for the churchaffiliated angel irina since she has always lived in purity letting her breasts get touched by me must be very serious but the feeling of irinas breasts still lingered in my hand so soft soft with elasticity feeling like my fingers were being sucked onto the breast the only way to sum it up was the breasts of an angel sounds like some kind of product but thats the only way to express it irina thank you very much just as i was thanking irina in my heart ah isekun suddenly someone called me this voice was ohoh its kiba right you guys were going to arashiyama today as well kibas group happened to be having lunch on the neighbouring
table yes you guys went to tenryuuji already yeah there was a spectacular dragon on the ceiling we were planning on going to visiting tenryuuji after seeing the togetsukyou16 im looking forward to it ah togetsukyou were going there after we finish eating as we spoke another familiar voice was saying autumn at arashiyama is really quite elegantoh so you all are enjoying arashiyama azazelsensei drinking sake in the middle of the day sensei sensei you came too but isnt it bad for teachers to drink during the day just as i pointed it out the woman opposite sensei agreed its rossweissesan this person i dont know how many times ive told him but he just wont listen i keep telling him not to act so irresponsibly in front of the students rossweissesans veins on her forehead were bulging in anger come on this is just a short break after investigating arashiyama is sensei really investigating the khaos brigade but then again rossweisse you really must learn to act cuter isnt this why you havent been able to find a man so far crash hearing senseis comment rossweissesans face went red and her fist hits the table this this this
has nothing to do with boyfriends dont mess with me if youre going to drink so will i ah she grabbed senseis cup and began to drink downing it gradually her drinking posture was very elegant puwaaa shay your ushual attitude ish no good she shes drunk too fast she cant even speak properly you youre drunk from one cup sensei was shocked but rossweissesan poured another and downed it instantly her eyes staring straight rossweissesan began to harass sensei am not drunk ive been drinking with him ever shinsh i became odin that old mans bodyguard thissss remindsh me that old man i ssssspent so much effort taking care of him during hish tripssss but like an idiot all heshays is rubbishhhhh like ah ladiesss ah booooooze ah breastssssss completely shhhhhamelessss all the other valkyriessssss at valhalla called me the old mans ssssservant girl with my pitiful ssssalary i even had to shupport his daily life its all hish fault thatsssss why i have no boyfriend no boyfriend no boyfriend ooooooooooh she was crying a storm making us and azazelsensei unsure of how to handle things sensei scratched his head and said i understand i understand i will listen
to your complaints just let it all out hearing senseis words rossweissesan suddenly became happy really azazelssssensei i didnt know you had shum good pointssssh in you waiter ten more bottlesh pleasssssse more this was getting out of hand who knew rossweissesan was such a poor drinker you guys leave as soon as you finish eating ill handle this sensei sighed as he spoke everyone looked at each other and did as they were told rapidly finishing our meals we left the shop 100 yen ssshopsssss are the best ah hahaha just as we were stepping out the door rossweissesans drunken laughter could be heard leaving the shop we reached togetsukyou rossweissechan sure made quite a scene yeah who knew she was such a poor drinker matsuda and motohama were most disappointed since rossweissesan was very popular amongst both the boys and the girls it must be very hard for the boys to accept the image they just saw even i took quite a shock dont be swayed by how young she looks but rossweissechan definitely had a tough life following that azazelsensei around anyone would want to spill out their discontentkiryuu nodded very sympathetic with rossweissesan however it definitely
wasnt just because of azazelsensei more likely it was because her original employer was a lecherous old man plus the fact that she had been mistreated in valhalla ever since she became old man odins follower unexpectedly it looked like she has been through much hardship you servants seem to have it tough kunou asked aa little i could only answer that way there were a lot of good people amongst the gremory servants but it was true that some of them had their peculiarities anyway lets not talk about rossweissesan for now the next stop was togetsukyou leaving the restaurant and walking along the sightseeing streets for a few minutes the katsura river appeared in front of us that traditional style wooden bridge full of historical feeling must be togetsukyou by the way the view of the mountain from here was really great the red all across the mountain gave a heavy sense of autumn did you know its said that you shouldnt turn back in the middle of crossing togetsukyou kiryuu said asia asked why is that asia its like this if you look back while crossing the bridge intelligence granted by the heavens will be taken back
if the pervert trio looks backit will really be over for them they will become utter fools shut up matsuda motohama and i retorted simultaneously kiryuu was unfazed and even continued another legend says that if you look back lovers will be separated hmm but this ones a bit inauspicious i will never look backasia interrupted kiryuus explanation and tearfully grabbed my arm it its okay asia its just a legend though i comforted her but asia shook her head and went unacceptable grabbing my arm tighter so cute thats my little asia ah i am so happy as we started crossing togetsukyou kibas group could be seen not far ahead while crossing the bridge asia was determined not to look back damn ise and little asia they totally look like a pair of lovers it makes me furious but it seems like they will soon enter the stage of passionate fools in love matsuda and motohama were commenting behind my back what saying passionate fools in love i really felt like turning around to give him a punch but i endured it turning back now will make asia cry i dont think you have to mind it the legend
about lovers is just superstition though kunou said that but asia is very innocent in these things we finally finished and peacefully crossed to the opposite shore asia exhaled deeply as if very much relieved but we have to cross again when we go back asias great adventure had not ended yet suddenly a warm slippery feeling enveloped my entire body what was that just now i thought surprised and looked around other than me asia xenovia irina kunou and kiba over there everyone else had disappeared matsuda motohama kiryuu and all the other normal tourists were gone what this is whats happened all the other servants were shocked like me and we prepared ourselves though we surveyed the surroundings but there were no suspicious characters nearby after a while a strange mist seemed to be floating up from under our feetthis mist is seeing the mist asia was very surprised this feeling no doubt about it when i was taken by diodora the device deep in the temple that imprisoned me had this kind of mist dimension lost said kiba as he walked over one of the longinus didnt sensei and diodora astaroth mention it i fear this is
kiba knelt down and tried to touch the mist with his hand longinus thats something just as amazing as vali and my sacred gears something like that was activated here hey are you all okay a voice from the sky looking up azazelsensei was flying in the sky flapping his black feathered wings he landed where we were and put away his wings as he spoke everything except us has disappeared completely most likely we were forcefully transferred to an alternate dimension and sealed within it from the way things look this is an alternate dimension that is an exact replica of togetsukyou and its surroundings really there were no signs of transfer beforehand once i felt that warm feeling it had already turned into this transferred here so this is made of something like the devils game field i asked sensei i couldnt feel there was anything similar between them ah yes the techniques of our three factions most likely leaked this place likely applies game field methods so the power of the mist should also be transferred to this replicated territory can dimension losts mist transfer anything that it wraps itself around to be able to transfer me
and rias servants all together at once to this place without any warning signs a longinus truly is terrifyingsensei explained i see so this kind of dimension really was an application of the game field technique their reproduction of it seemed to be just as good as the devils beside me kunou spoke in a trembling voice on the verge of death mothers dying guard reported that they were also trapped by mist without warning so this phenomenon was besides the person using this should be my ominous premonition seemed to have come true over at togetsukyou the appearance of several new presences could be felt from the light mist figures approached and revealed themselves to us pleased to meet you for the first time governor azazel and the sekiryuutei the one who greeted us was a blackhaired youth wearing a school uniform wrapped around the uniform was something resembling han chinese clothing that should be called han chinese clothing right in middle school the history teacher was very knowledgeable about chinese history and explained to us in detail about their clothing it seemed to be a type of traditional ethnic attire carrying a spear in his hands the spear
gave off a most unpleasant feeling it was definitely no ordinary spear the blackhaired man was very young looks like he was about a year or two older than me no it was impossible to tell from appearances alonehis companions were also wearing clothes similar to school uniforms male and female also around high school age they gave off a strange kind of presence different from devils or dragons sensei stepped forward are you the rumored hero faction the youth in the middle patted the spear on his shoulder as he answered senseis question i am cao cao the descendant of the famous cao cao cao mengde recorded in the records of the three kingdoms something like that cao cao cao cao eh records of the three kingdoms with a big shock i hurriedly asked sensei sensei that guy is sensei did not take his eyes off his opponent and said to us listen well everyone be careful of that mans spear true longinus the most powerful longinus said to be able to pierce through god i have not seen it for a long time but to think it has now fallen into the hands of the terrorists senseis words
made everyone terrified the man himself was intriguing enough but we all stared with shock at the spear that is the holy spear that the seraphim of heaven fear irina spoke unable to contain her trembling xenovia continued whispering i also heard about it ever since i was a child the spear that pierced jesus the spear carrying jesus blood the absolute spear which pierced the body of god wwas it something so powerful i think buchou seems to have mentioned about that spear before something about the legendary spear that pierced christ ccome to think of it this is intimately related to the roots of thereligion that irina and xenovia belong to to those involved with the church perhaps it wouldnt be wrong to call it the ultimate existence that is the holy spear beside me asias gaze seemed to be drawn to the spear as if her consciousness was being sucked out mesmerised clap sensei quickly covered her eyes with his hands asia people of faith should not stare at that spear they will lose their sanity after all it is one of the holy relics amongst the true cross the holy chalice the holy nails and the
shroud of turin kunou angrily yelled at the spearwielding youth cao cao you boy i have questions for you arara this little princess whats the problem if i can i will try to answer all your questions though cao cao sounded calm he clearly knew something are you the ones who took mother away that is correct he admitted so openly it turned out to be these people after all what are you planning on doing to mother we wish to have your mother cooperate in our experiment experiment what are you planning to do to grant the wish of our benefactor that is the main idea hearing that kunou bared her fangs extremely angry her eyes glimmered with traces of tears it looked like she was furious not only was her mother taken away but she will be used for some kind of nefarious experiment benefactor is that ophis and why have you appeared before us sensei interrogated sternlyno there is no need to hide anymore we just decided to say hi before the experiment let us cooperate for a bit i also wish to meet governor azazel and the legendary sekiryuutei this bastard sure has a way with
words by the way am i really that famous ah though i did beat that old maou leader during the effects of juggernaut only i dont really remember much about that scene sensei formed a spear of light in his hand lets keep this simple please return the leader of the kyuubi we are trying hard to join forces with the youkai seeing sensei prepared for battle everyone gathered into formation and prepared themselves i also called out boosted gear and started the balance breaker countdown and then summoned ascalon xenovia appreciated xenovia caught ascalon and readied her stance by the way rossweissesan wasnt here sensei where is rossweissesan sensei made a long sigh at my question that fellow was also transferred here but she is still sleeping at the restaurant i placed a strong barrier over her so it should be fine for now sso thats what happened ttrue it would be unthinkable for her to battle in her drunken state however sensei i will be responsible for support in contrast to our state of alert the other side made no signs to prepare are they that confident or they have some sort of secret weapon after all the
hero faction has gathered many sacred gear users it was such a pain to battle against sacred gears there were all sorts of weird powers which made things very unpredictable that was the scariest thing anyway we cant show any signs of weaknessa short boy stood next to cao cao cao cao said to him leonardo ill let you handle the devils with your monsters only one request but the boy remained expressionless and lightly nodded instantly shadows appeared from under his feet and rapidly expanded i felt a sensation as if something cold was crawling on my back how should i put it a certain fearfulness could be felt from the shadows as the shadows grew it reached the level of covering the entire togetsukyou and then they expanded and gradually took form arms legs heads eyeballs wide gaping jaws separating not only one but ten no hundreds guuuu chomp gobble with a deafening roar these monsters appeared out of the shadows shadows with monsters appearing out of them oh rather than appear perhaps created or made was a better description monsters with black skin and standing upright on two legs their bodies were solidly built with rough and
thick hides they also had very sharp claws and bared their teeth these monsters formed a line and stood in the forefront what was this the boys power was i couldnt help making swallowing sounds in my throat as i was shocked by the boys power sensei spoke softly at this time annihilation maker annihilation maker maker meant creation right cao cao laughed in response correct this child carries one of the longinus a different threat compared to my true longinus but the most deadly sacred gear nonetheless longinus this kid also owned a longinus a longinus userehwhat the heck is this a longinus free market now i basically knew nothing about them other than valis and my own so all these new developments are just a real pain and then the countdown finished and i entered balance breaker the red aura enveloped me and formed into armour now i can have a good fight but ssensei i have something i dont understand completely confused i asked sensei sensei began to explain like you that boy possesses one of the longinus currently there are thirteen confirmed longinus amongst the grigori there are also longinus possessors and amongst all these longinus
the properties of that one over there in other words its abilities are deadlier than boosted gear or divine dividing sstronger than me in terms of pure power of course your boosted gear and valis are far ahead however in terms of abilities kibas sword birth can create countless demonic swords this you can understand right yes yes annihilation maker is the same it can create countless demonic beasts for example those massive fire breathing monsters over 100m tall you see in movies can be recreated by sheer will the ability to create monsters from imagination isnt that a disaster this ability depending on the users capability can create on the scale of hundreds or even thousands like dimension lost this is one of the worst bugs in the sacred gear system dimension lost is also extremely dangerous depending on the user once the mist reaches the scale of countries it can transfer an entire country and its people into the dimensional gap to be destroyed uunthinkable no matter which one arent they the worst sacred gears sensei could only force a laughwell up to now none of them have reached such levels there were a few close calls in
the past however it is unprecedented to have gathered three of the four top tier longinus true longinus dimension lost and annihilation maker from birth these possessors should have been under surveillance by the fallen angels angels and devils but twenty years have passed were we too careless or someone deliberately hid them compared to the past almost all current longinus possessors have been very difficult to find sensei looked towards me so basically i was also one of those who were successively classified as dangerous sacred gear kill him and then actually its not and finally no it really is a longinus was it related to this sensei continued there must be some kind of cause and effect relationship going on in the current age it could be said that the first longinus sacred gears were bugs or errors of the system in turn these longinus have their own tumultuous developments beyond our expectations though this is just a hopeful but not farfetched hypothesis watching ises development makes one feel like all the current longinus as a group are undergoing incredible changes bugs errors no evolution no matter what though it includes me perhaps those in charge of researching
and maintaining the system have been too naive michael sirzechs sensei seemed to have started an endless dialogue with himself but no matter how you look at it wasnt a sacred gear to create monsters truly strange and dangerous and it was described as more dangerous than my sacred gear that is to say depending on the user it can create monsters like dragon kings tanninossan and fenrir that monstrous wolf on mass produced scale annihilation the world will be annihilated sensei what weaknesses do these deadly sacred gears have if boosted gear and divine dividing have weaknesses then surely target the users body of course there are also cases where the body is extremely strong but it still doesnt compare to the threat of the sacred gear the current annihilation maker user is still under a developing phase if he already mastered it then they would have been sendingdemonic beast armies to every faction by now the only way to defeat him is to take him out now before he matures cao cao laughed wryly as he heard senseis words arara it feels like annihilation maker has been figured out it is as you say governor of the fallen
angels this child still has not matured his imagination or productivity except he has focused on one specialty monsters that target the opponents weaknesses the antimonsters the current demonic beasts are ones which counter devils cao cao pointed his finger at a shop in the area a monster opened its mouth bzzzzzt a beam of light appeared and in that instant boom the shop was blown away by an intense explosion an attack of light this fellow is amidst the strong wind of the explosion sensei snarled angrily cao cao you bastard you sent assassins to all the major factions to collect data for the antimonsters you are half correct werent there black clad members amongst the sacred gear we sent out yes those black combatants those hated things which dispersed into mist when hit those are also monsters created by this child these things deliberately took on the attacks from the various factions angels fallen angels devils dragons and gods from all mythologies though they were wiped out they have gathered plenty of good data for this childs sacred gear those strange black men were for collecting data not only were the number of balance breaker users increased but
the development of the antimonsters also advanced thanks to that antimonsters targeting devils angels and dragons have been created atmaximum output the current antidevil antimonsters can produce light equivalent to a mid class angel collecting data to make antimonsters at the same time as increasing the number of balance breakers amongst sacred gear users is he trying to show how well prepared or smart they were these guys they are dangerous without bound sensei glared with contempt but immediately began to laugh but cao cao that means you have yet to create godkilling beasts cao cao did not deny senseis words how did you figure it out sensei replied to me in a tired voice if they could they would have already done so and then they would have used them on us as well there is no reason they wouldnt attempt it if they have the resources to launch simultaneous attacks at the different factions and who knows how the world would change if gods from various mythologies were killed to this point in time they still can not create godkilling demonic beasts though this is all we know it is still important news i see they dont have
godkilling demonic beasts ah but such a thing does exist the image of that gigantic wolf flashed in my mind cao cao pointed his spear at us if its a god then i will kill it with this spear come the battle begins now this was the declaration of war gobble making terrifying roars the antimonsters charged at us kiba and xenovia went and stood in the frontlines kiba please make me a holy sword understood after all youre more suited to a two sword stylekiba quickly created a sword in his hand and aimed it at xenovia who had already begun to advance catching the holy sword in mid air xenovia wielded it along with ascalon and dove straight into the ranks of the enemies slashed by xenovias sweeping attacks huge numbers of antimonsters were easily vanquished true to a power type knight this penetrative power was unbelievable ah a monster opened its mouth to release a beam of light bzzzt the beam traveled to just before xenovia but kiba deflected it with his holy demonic sword sending it into a building in the distance causing it to collapse if its this level of light its fine as long
as we dont get hit what a cool and handsome knight thats right possessing godlike speed there is no problem as long as kiba doesnt get hit no lets just kill them all before they hit us slicing and pulverising the monsters with ascalon and the holy sword xenovia answered like that though both were knights their battle styles were entirely different and both their philosophies sounded so right cao cao would you like to be defeated by me sensei took out the dragon gem fafnirs jewel and then his entire body was wrapped in the golden armour of the artificial sacred gear at the same time he extended his twelve black wings and rushed at cao cao with high speed that would be a great honor to be able to fight the fallen angel governor recorded in the bible cao cao landed on the shore of the katsura river his face smiling fearlessly as he raised the holy spear the front portion of true longinus opened to release a golden aura which shaped itself into the blade of a spearthe instant it opened it was as if the entire air shook it could only be described as holy and
solemn just gazing at it made my body feel tense and suffocating even for a nonbeliever the influence of that spear was that strong crash as senseis spear of light clashed against cao caos holy spear violent shockwaves were created this impact created waves and disturbances in the katsura river splashing water everywhere water droplets fell upon togetsukyou like a violent rainstorm as sensei and cao cao attacked each other and carried out their battle they gradually moved downstream along the shore of the river i will leave cao cao to sensei let us take care of the rest the first priority was the key to our group battles setting up the defensive wall for asia who was responsible for healing normally our team had buchou commanding with akenosan supporting her and providing suppressive fire konekochan providing offense and support and gasper in the role of scouting and support even long range bombardment from rossweissesan was not here though we had sensei and the angel irina providing super powerful offense the balance of the team has been broken by the absence of those five we needed a new formation kunou also needed to be protected at all costs in this
place she was more important than us she should be placed behind asia should xenovia be the vanguard think carefully think carefully think carefully words like i dont get it or i cant do it are unfitting for a future king if it was buchou how will she act what would she do in a time like this id better think carefully oooooh at the end of my wits i finally came up with my strategy xenovia you will guard asia and kunou also use the holy aura to blow away any enemies who get near i gave orders to xenovia even though i wasnt buchou but please xenovia listen to meacknowledged oh oh xenovia answered me and quickly retreated to protect asia think again what would buchou do if she were here though it was a sudden encounter this is a real battle i have to make full use of the second years here my pitifully few brain cells began to work rapidly again spurt my nose is bleeding from thinking too hard eh nosebleeding it was possible to have those in situations unrelated to erotic things our opponents have arranged antidevil antimonsters no matter how we deflect their
attacks damage would be huge if a hit connects suddenly kibas ability flashed in my mind kiba you can make those lightdevouring demonic swords right eh yes i see kiba quickly understood my question how impressive kiba under kibas feet appeared several of those swords of darkness he used against freed in the battle against raynare and he tossed them at his devil teammates these swords have only a hilt in their normal state you have to channel demonic power into them to form the blade of darkness kiba supplemented at the same time i continued giving orders xenovia in times of danger use this as a shield to absorb light asia even though youre not used to swords hold on to it its better than nothing got it ise yes yes xenovia and asia both answered me xenovia put the sword hilt into her skirt pocket she will use it in emergencies i held kibas sword hey ddraig lets apply this swords power to the gauntlet reckless actions like that could endanger your life but in this case it should be fine for a short while dont overdo it thats good enough ill plug it into the gauntlet where
ascalon was extracted from i placed the lightdevouring sword of darkness into ascalons socket immediately something like a dark shadowy shield appeared over the left gauntlet it worked this should provide a fair degree of defense next the angel irina i turned to irina irina sorry but could you take xenovias place in the frontlines with kiba as an angel light isnt a weakness for you right though angels can still be hurt by light but it is not a critical weakness like for devils got it ii will go i am michaelsamas ace irina flapped her pure white wings and flew to xenovias former vanguard position summoning swords of light irina charged left and right from the air breaking apart the formation of the antimonsters and then looked for opportunities to slaughter them in one fell swoop great though the tactics were a little complicated but i have given everyone orders i havent wasted my time by buchous side watching her command next was me the position between kibas group of forwards and asias group of defenders the midfielder position asia promote me to bishop yes as i spoke and asia consented i became the bishop my dismal demonic
power limits was raised the reason i chose the bishop was to focus on dragon shot come taste it i knew what was well within the abilities of my demonic power clumsy attacks of pure concentrated magic in terms of pure power they were not bad at alllets go dragon shot unleashed doooo doooooonn doooo as i used the shield of darkness i bombarded the antimonsters and the hero faction with a barrage of medium scale masses of demonic power though the members of the hero faction all dodged many of the antimonsters were hit by my attacks and destroyed at the same time the shield of darkness absorbed the light firing from the enemies excellent a beam of light aimed at kunou was also deflected by a dragon missile kunou please step a bit further back ssorry if the kyoto princess got hurt things would be serious after all she was just a young girl it wouldnt do for her to enter the battle xenovia also attacked from the back using holy sword pulses to snipe at the antimonsters in front suffering xenovias and my attacks the antimonster squad rapidly disappeared however the shadows stirred beneath that kid and
created new monsters again and again damn it was there no end to this but we can not give up to mass produce these things there must be a limit to stamina and concentration but the rate this kid is going is way too fast the occasional attack from the antimonsters hit our group but asia can heal them instantly so it wasnt a problem yes asia was our life line really asiachan is too wonderful only sending antimonsters against us up to now those hero faction bastards have done nothing other than dodging our attacks it makes me mad are they just going to let the monsters fight and just watch just as i was thinking that while firing dragon shot a few shadowy figures suddenly advanced towards me uniform wearing girls were those clothes the uniform of the hero factionlet us handle the sekiryuutei spears as well as swords flashed with chilling light as they attacked me stop women can not win against the sekiryuutei warned a gentle looking man with white hair and several swords hanging at his waist hmph that was right girls can not defeat me i quickly concentrated magic in my brain this was
one of the few types of magic i can manage breasts liberate your words bilingual i released magic in the direction of the girls and instantly a mysterious space deployed with me as the centre this technique was too perfect come breasts of the ladies let me hear your thoughts the breasts began to speak in a voice that could only be heard by me and ddraig use a feint to make a mockery of him and then attack all at once ah so they are planning on a joint attack i will attack from the right this one is from the right i will attack straight this one will come at me straight muahaha hearing the voices of breasts i had a feeling of omniscience hmph let me read your breasts well yo ho all their attacks were evaded impossible how could he know all our movements one of the girls was very surprised impossible how can we be read our joint attacks should have no openingsi showed an extremely bored smile towards these surprised girls of course its possible let me reveal it your breasts go dress break i yelled out the name of the move yes while
i dodged their attacks i had already made contact with your clothes with the sounds of papaba their clothes were blown apart most spectacularly iiyaaaaaaaah he cast a spell on our clothes theyre all gone the girls screamed as they attempted to hide their naked bodies woohoo everybody trained well what golden proportions oh nosebleed a nosebleed came again overcome with shame the girls escaped into a nearby house hmph as long as the opponent is a girl neither my hand nor my delusions will rest where else could you find such exhilarating time defeating enemies with these spectacular godly skills bilingual and dress break are invincible wwhat a vulgar technique ive never seen anything so despicable kunou was completely shocked by my moves described by a little girl that way i felt a great hit to my self esteem truly it is impossible for females to win against the sekiryuutei unless they have an iron will and the ability to ignore shame its truly difficult for young women true to the name of the chichiryutei i now witness the legendary breast skills but these are useless against males the elegant gentleman spoke even though it was a calm analysis
it still made me feel embarrassed who would want to use them on men i retorted forcefully the man smiled as if very much amused the man smiled and turned to the rest of the hero faction to speak everyone be careful he is the sekiryuutei the least talented in all history and lacking in strength however he doesnt indulge in power and is adangerous sekiryuutei who doesnt lose control a person who holds great power but does not fall to arrogance is one who has nothing to fear do not be careless really this is embarrassing so much praise to be described that way by enemies yes it was the first time to be praised this way by enemies no it wasnt really praise but more like a reminder still it was the first time the man tilted his head slightly hearing my words is that so current sekiryuutei in our view you are far more dangerous than you realise similarly your companion vali is the same iit felt like sitting on a pincushion what is going on this was the first time though sairaorgsan also praised me but even for the terrorists to say so these fellows who
dont look down on me are especially tricky next i guess its time for me to act the man made a step forward and released his swords from his belt a pleasure to meet you for the first time gremory servants i am sig the descendant of the hero siegfried my companions call me siegfried what you choose to call me is up to you the frail looking gentleman siegfrieds face made xenovia realise something as she showed shock and surprise ive felt ive seen you before somewhere it was true after all to xenovias question irina nodded yes it must be from the multiple demonic swords at his waist there is no doubt what was going on since he had white hair i could only be reminded of that person freed whats going on you two you know something about that handsome guy whos like a white kibawhite kiba thats going a bit far isesan dont say it like that kiba its just an example xenovia responded to my query that man is an exorcist a former colleague of irinas and mine a top warrior in the catholic protestant and orthodox churches demonic emperor sig he has the same
white hair as freed because they were trained by the same organization it seems to be the side effect of some kind of experiment exorcist someone related to the church by the way then hes similar to freed thinking of that guy makes me sick sigsan you betrayed the church betrayed heaven irina screamed siegfrieds lips curled happily i guess you can call it betrayal i now belong to the khaos brigade thats why hearing those words irina became angry why betraying the church and joining an evil organization leads to eternal damnation this is making my ears hurt siegfried laughed whats wrong with that even in my absense the church still has the strongest warrior as long as that someone stays the loss of me and the durandal user xenovia can be covered however who could have expected that person to become the joker candidate for the brave saints anyway enough of the chitchat arent you sword wielders very capable xenovia the durandal user shidou irina the ace of michael the leader of the angels and kiba yuuto of the holy demonic sword challenging the swordsmen no the three who were related to the church siegfrieds sword in his
hand began to gather demonic power this sword gave off a very unpleasant pulse demonic sword it felt quite similar to kibas created swords suddenly kibas holy demonic sword slashed with godlike speedblocking the holy demonic sword directly there was no damage at all to the unpleasant demonic power gathered upon siegfrieds sword demonic emperor sword gram for the strongest demonic sword a strike from the holy demonic sword was nothing the two entered closequartered combat it has been quite a while since the last time i witnessed kiba fighting so intensely with someone the two swiftly retreated and readied their stance immediately they began clashing violently creating sparks everywhere a match for kiba no gradually kiba was being suppressed and a rare serious expression could be seen on kibas face god speed kibas movements were being captured with movements and slashing attacks faster than the eye could follow the opponent was still keeping up in a composed and matteroffact manner can he clearly see through that kind of speed even when he pretended to attack none of kibas feints were successful in baiting siegfried on the other hand he used the minimum neccessary movement to evade kibas attacks when
he thrusted the demonic sword in his hand kiba had to dodge with his full attention there was no room for counterattacking even kiba in balance breaker was being dominated one of the hero faction explained to the stupefied me in our organization though they reside in separate factions holy royal sword arthur and demonic emperor sword siegfried are equally renowned holy demonic sword kiba is not their match equal to that arthur that guy who easily toyed with fenrirs child tthen kiba now though i worried someone appeared to join in their duel xenovia slashing without hesitation from the side she began to assist kiba xenovia kiba you can not win alone even against your wishes i have to participateuh thanks at this moment kiba set aside his pride as a swordsman and attacked simultaneously with xenovia i will join in too from the outskirts irina also entered the battle forming a three on one situation xenovias dual wielding kibas holy demonic sword irinas sword of light the three of them attacked at once it was no longer possible to capture the speeding blade tips with my eyes as the four of them battled with intensity but even against
three opponents siegfried only used a single sword kibas god speed created afterimages as he repeatedly tried to disrupt siegfrieds attacks from blind angles from above xenovia was slashing down with a massive holy sword aura furthermore irina was gliding through the air rapidly as she thrusted her sword of light towards the back of siegfrieds hand this simultaneous attck i was certain of victory however siegfried flipped his hand and casually blocked irinas attack without even turning his head back at the same time he drew another sword from his waist using his free hand with a flash of silver one of xenovias downward slashing swords was broken that was the holy sword kiba created with a fantastic sound like that of glass shattering it was destroyed siegfried calmly spoke balmung this is the power of one strike from the demonic sword of norse legends another demonic sword however kibas dead angle attack still hasnt ended there was an opening and it shouldnt be possible to evade for both of siegfrieds arms were already wielding demonic swords with a horizontal flash kiba sliced towards his abdomen in that instantclang the sound of metal kibas holy demonic sword was just
stopped by the demonic sword siegfried drew out from its sheath nothung this is also a legendary demonic sword the third demonic sword no what was even more surprising was that siegfrieds two arms were already wielding swords and couldnt possibly hold a third sword his two arms were occupied however a third arm has grown from his back to draw that sword blocking kibas attack wwhat was that arm an arm covered by things resembling silver scales it was almost like my left arm when it became the arm of a dragons this arm grew out from siegfrieds back siegfried laughed at our immense surprise this dragon arm its twice critical a very common sacred gear but mine is a little different a subspecies it grows something like a dragons arm from my back twice critical ive heard of it an inferior sacred gear ranking below my boosted gear a sacred gear that should be in the shape of a gauntlet a subspecies growing an arm out of ones back siegfried held two demonic swords in each hand with the arm on his back holding a third a three sword stance witnessing this scene kibas expression became even more
serious we are both sacred gear users however even ignoring the attributes of his swords am i unable to surpass him even in the use of the sacred gear by the way i havent entered balance breaker yet a harsh reminder constantly repeating their experiments members of the hero faction could not possibly be unable to use their balance breakersdominating kiba xenovia and irina all at once in just his normal state this guy is too strong with a rustling thud sensei landed in front of us who were caught in a crisis at the same time cao cao returned to the centre of the hero faction as their attacks repeated they circled back to their starting point i took a glance downstream at where they had come from the ground has turned into a smoking wasteland waaaaaaaah from a while back there had been loud crashing noises which made me suspect dramatic occurrences arashiyamas scenery has been entirely destroyed sensei knew this was an artificial space so he mercilessly used his biggest spears of light a few spots on senseis armor had shattered the black wings were also in a messy state cao caos uniform and han chinese attire
was also torn in many places however i find it more amazing that a human did so well against the legendary fallen angel governor was this the hero faction heroes true longinus dont worry ise neither of us went all out we were just testing each other out a bit senseis socalled little testing resulted in the complete destruction of the area downstream cao cao cracked his neck audibly and said what a great devil servant team i guess these are the servants of rias gremory well known amongst the new generation of devils we were intending to have a fight without exerting ourselves but you guys turned out with a great performance if my theories are correct the one who gathered this unnaturally strong group is hyoudou issei your power despite your lack of natural talent or demonic powers i believe your ability to attract others by holding dragon powers is topnotch amongst all the past sekiryuutei look isnt the dragon gathering power right now it is truly conspicuous in both good and bad situations as all kinds of legendary existences attack and you encounter each of the dragon kings and gatherall these chichiryuutei supporters these are all evidence
of that even in the absence of their king you handled the situation and organised the servants with outstanding calmness naive and flawed arrangements but nonetheless you may turn out to be a terrifying opponent if you train well in the future i have never considered such things everything that has happened so far was because of me cao caos spear pointed at me thats why we dont intend to make the same mistakes as the old maou faction we truly believe in the future you will become the most dangerous sekiryuutei this applies to the other servants as well if we eliminate you all now perhaps we may even gather some useful data for analysis is that how they saw my no our developments it was true that there was a fundamental difference in the way they treated us unlike the old maou faction who saw us as a bunch of stupid kids frustrating how do i handle opponents like these up until now ive only faced opponents who treated me as a fool thus providing openings sensei questioned cao cao one more question what are the motives of your hero faction cao cao narrowed his eyes and said
governor of the fallen angels you may find it surprising but it is incredibly simple we just want to know the limits of what it means to be human and challenge it furthermore humans will be the ones to defeat devils dragons fallen angels and other supernatural races no definitely it is humans who will win you want to be heroes after all you are the descendants of cough heroes cao cao raised an index finger and pointed to the sky above his head this is just a little challenge presented by frail humans under the heavens how far can humans go that is what we wish to try humans ehas humans how far can they go was this their objective no there must be some other motives sensei sighed and said to me ise do not be too careless this guy is an enemy worse than the old maou faction shalba beelzebub all your opponents here are very strong especially this guy who is just as dangerous as vali the same as vali vali also gave off this feeling of having no bottom line possessing the ultimate holy spear was also quite a threat as sensei gathered our group
the hero faction has also shifted their formation all this time they have endlessly created more antimonsters it really seemed limitless also the hero faction held back without attacking however our opponents seemed to be ready it looks like the second wave will be the real battle they have more sacred gear users right and there were also many who could enter balance breaker i keep getting swept into these crises will that goddess show up to save me again no its not right i sure dont want to receive direct protection from the great god of breasts just as i was thinking clap right in between us and the hero faction a shining magic circle appeared a crest never seen before this is sensei seemed to know who a fallen angel as we watched with surprise at the light before us an extremely cute foreign girl appeared dressed like a mage aa girl i was shocked the girl wore a huge hat and a cape it really was the attire of a mage her age looked like a middle schoolers her body was quite slim the girl turned towards us who had gathered around in a circle and deeply
bowed her headsmiling radiantly towards us nice to meet you all for the first time i am le fay le fay pendragon the mage belonging to valis team please take good care of me vavavalis team why why would valis teammate come to this place sensei asked the girl le fay pendragon who are you to arthur yes arthur is my elder brother he always takes care of me that cool gentlemans younger sister to think he had such a cute little sister sensei scratched his chin and said so le fay like that legendary witch morgana le fay it has been said that morgana and the hero king arthur pendragon were blood related there were twinkling stars in le fays eyes as she looked towards me um ummm she walked to me and held out her hand iii am a fan of the chichiryuutei the oppai dragon iif youre not too busy can you shake hands with me eh this i was completely taken by surprise and didnt know how to react for something like that to be said in the middle of this tense battle still i went thanks and shook her hand done extremely happy hmm what
did this child want cao caos side was also shocked and puzzling over the matter very much troubled finally it was cao cao who scratched his head and asked so its valis side whats the matterwithout any hesistation le fay responded to cao cao in all smiles yes i came to bring a message from valisama i thought i told you not to disturb me thats the message oh you need to be punished for trying to put us under surveillance oh crash immediately following le fays adorable announcement the ground began to shake violently what was this shaking an earthquake it was already hard to keep standing asia and kunou were unable to maintain their balance and fell over on their bottom crack it was the sound of something sliced open looking towards there the ground had swollen up as if something huge was about to burst through tearing the ground apart and creating clouds of dust what appeared was guuuuuuuuuuutz a massive giantlike thing was roaring what what what what what what what what what was that thing that huge enormous thing like a giant stone rock it wasnt clear what kind of material but it was definitely
constructed out of inorganic material its arms and legs were also huge at least ten metres sensei looked up to the giant and yelled its gogmagog le fay answered sensei lightly yes this is one of the strong characters in our team gogmagog or gogzkun gogzkun theres such a cute nickname sensei that moving rock giant is sensei explained to me sorry sensei i keep needing clarifications from you todaygogmagog something like a gargoyle that was placed in the dimensional gap floating in a state of suspension in the dimensional gap it seems to be a mass produced weapon of destruction created by ancient gods they should all have been deactivated by now a golem i see so thats why it felt so inorganic that kind of thing exists in the dimensional gap what deactivated that guy is moving ah this is the first moving one i have encountered i have too many questions though it was said that they were deactivated and placed in the dimensional gap but to be moving this makes me so interested oh no its here again senseis eyes were shining like a childs sensei keeps getting delighted by things like divine creations ancient weapons
and such stuff however he immediatly recovered and started muttering to himself i see last time what vali was checking out when hanging around the dimensional gap was not just great red le fay answered senseis concerns yes it was valisama who detected gogzkuns existence ophissama once mentioned discovering this giant that could move in the dimensional gap so we went there again to search for it hey so what other fellows are in the team i asked le fay other than bikou fenrir and this golem now knowing i will be fighting vali one day it really made me uneasy yes currently theres valisama bikousama brother arthur kurokasan fenrirchan gogzkun as well as me seven in total so i see only seven of them that was all but still its too much that vali he keeps gathering all these criminals but sensei if great red is there why would the dimensional gap have that kind of giant the dimensional gap is quite troublesome to handle but there is actually quite a bit of leeway all great red wants to do is swim around freely in the dimensional gap and does not pose any real threat he is a specialexistence
so none of the factions place great red in their rankings and categories all he cares is to swim freely unhindered in the dimensional gap just as sensei spoke to this point the golem raised its giant fists at the hero faction roar accompanied by an incomparably loud sound of smashing the golem smashed togetsukyou in one hit oh nooooooooooo that is the famous sight at arashiyama thankfully this is just a dimension that replicates arashiyama the gargoyles attack slaughtered massive numbers of antimonsters while the members of the hero faction retreated hiding on the other side of the river hahahaha valis angry looks like our surveillance was discovered cao cao laughed in a loud voice and pointed his spear at the golem extend woosh the tip of the spear suddenly extended piercing the shoulder of the golem the giant golem lost balance and fell onto the ground wow what an impact that golem must have been heavy just by falling over it created such a huge shockwave and everything nearby was shaking that spear knocked over the giant golem with just one hit it can extend and can also produce an energy blade so many functions however the bridge
was wrecked we can only fly across right as i considered the next step a figure entered my view on the shore in front of the hero faction there was someone shaking and staggering unable to walk properly a silverhaired woman rossweissesan hey itsh sssooo noisshy people cant ssssleep hic properly here still drunk and angrythe arrival of the drunk made the members of the hero faction look at one another in puzzlement however they intended to attack whether or not she was affiliated with the gremory servants or not tthis is bad in that drunken state rossweissesan was in danger i must go over to help as i thought that we all rushed forward however whatssh the matter you want a fight sho ill ssshhhow yall the power of old man odins former bodyguard valkyrie as rossweissesan yelled an unbelievable number of magic circles appeared all around her it wasnt just ten or twenty tassste my norssssh magic which countersssss all attributessss all fairiessss and all divine exisssstencessss from the terrifying number of magic circles out spewed a frightening number of magical attacks which filled the sky changed their trajectories and finally fell upon the hero faction like a
heavy rainstorm wwoah this was unbelievable fire light water thunder and magical attacks with all sorts of attributes swept everything aside and approached the hero faction whether houses shops roads or electrical poles everything turned into dust and disappeared without a trace though i already knew she was a master in magic ah i never thought the great valkyriesan could blow away an entire town thinking about it it should have been obvious from the way she took part in the battle against loki bbuchou has really gathered someone powerful if thats the case she will really shine in the rating game mist appeared into view though it felt like the magical attacks were about to hit the hero faction but a youth wearing a uniform with a feathered cape produced mist from his hand and deflected all the magic that was the mist user he can defend against that kind of magical attackmist slowly spread from the mist users hand eventually covering the entire hero faction cao cao spoke from within the mist there are a bit too many interferences however it was a fun opening ceremony governor azazel as if very enjoying things that guy announced to us
tonight we will be using kyotos special leylines and the kyuubi leader and turn nijou castle17 into a great massive experiment in order to stop us please come and participate the mist thickened the mist that started out beneath our feet spread to the chests and approached our faces and then slowly our entire view was blocked by the mist and everything disappeared hey everyone has returned to the original reality put away your weapons sensei reminded us we were finally back at the real arashiyama tthis was bad i immediately released my armour in the blink of an eye the mist disappeared and we were back at the crowded streets next to togetsukyou other than us the tourists crossed the bridge as if nothing had happened the bridge was intact things were back to the original world hey ise whats going on youre making a superscary face matsuda stared at my face ii see we had just crossed togetsukyou nothing nothing at all having answered i exhaled deeply all the other servants had serious expressions as well the battle just now had been far too dangerous it was impossible to revert our moods so easily le fay was gone
same with that giant thing did they disappear the same time as the mistcrash sensei angrily struck an electrical pole speaking rubbish experimenting on kyoto dont underestimate us kids wow sensei was really mad i havent seen sensei this angry for a long time mother mother didnt do anything but why kunous body trembled i could only stroke her head unable to do anything else cao caos sudden attack and his announcement of the experiment at nijou castle buchou looks like our school trip has come to a totally unexpected climaxlife 4 showdown gremory group vs heroes faction in kyoto part 1 ah i really stuffed myself they even had a buffet combining japanese western and chinese cuisine we are so lucky to be students of kuou academy that is so true after dinner and soaking in the bath matsuda and motohama lazed about in their room their faces filled with happy satisfaction after the battle at togetsukyou we visited nijou castle and then returned to the hotel i was now in the room of those two tomorrow will be the last day of the trip which will mostly be buying souvenirs to bring back thus we decided to use
this room to prepare the flatscreen tv for reviewing the photos we have taken so far pardon our intrusion the beautiful quartet has arrived after a bath perverts kiryuu announced as she led asia and the rest into the room all in their sleepwear oh oh oh asiachan in pajamas after a bath is the best lets begin matsuda enthusiastically pressed play and the slideshow began on the tv the first photos were taken on the bullet train then kyoto station and the hotel other than that there was fushimi inari kiyomizudera and everywhere else all the scenery we photographed over the past three days in kyoto was displayed one by one on the tv that was the time when motohama almost fell down from the stairs matsuda isnt that the time you tried to swallow the snacks at the booth all at once and they got stuck in your throati say you two stop staring at girls from other schools with lewd gazes every time for you guys to bring those perverted expressions all the way to kyoto it really looks bad on our school everyone burst out laughing whenever matsuda motohama and kiryuu shared their memories this was
the precious school trip experience as i immersed myself in the joy of the review party i quietly clenched my fist no matter what happens i will face the next day with everyone and everyone will go back together back to kuou academy after enjoying the photos it was bedtime the gremory group plus irina the sitri servants azazelsensei and leviathansama all gathered in my room we were now using my room to discuss tonights upcoming events tonight the heroes factions experiment was going to be undertaken at nijou castle by the way the room was too small so everyone had to stand that was to be expected after all we were fitting more than ten people in a room the size of eight tatami mats xenovia and irina were participating in the discussion while sitting in the closet you two like that narrow space so much after being so drunk during the day rossweissesans face was quite pale but she still insisted on joining though i heard that she drank her own sobering medicine and recovered however she still doesnt look too well sensei glanced at everyone and then began a map of the entire kyoto area was spread
out over the centre of the room so lets start explaining our battle plan the area centred around nijou castle and kyoto station is now in a state of high alert all devils and fallen angels stationed in kyoto have been mobilized to search for suspicious characters the kyoto youkai are also providing us with assistance though we still havent confirmed the movements of the heroes factionwe have successfully detected an ominous presence concentrating at nijou castle as the centre an ominous presence kiba asked sensei yes from ancient times kyoto was a city constructed using the principles of yin yang and feng shui like a large scale magic circle as a result there are many special power spots like seimei shrines18 seimei well suzumushi temples kofukujizo19 fushimi inaris pine tree hizamatsusan and others locations with incredible auras are too many to count however the flow has currently gone turbulent and is gathering at nijou castle saji swallowed a mouthful of spit and asked what what will happen no idea but definitely not something good since they plan on using the kyuubi leader who controls the leylines of this city to carry out some kind of experiment we will use
this key point as the basis of the entire plan hearing senseis words everyone nodded and then sensei officially began explaining the plan to us first are the sitri servants you will be on guard in the area around kyoto station guarding this hotel is also your job the hotel itself already has a strengthened barrier so if anything happens there will be a safeguard still if anyone suspicious approaches you sitri servants will be responsible for handling them understood the entire sitri group replied next is the gremory group plus irina im really sorry for putting you all on the spot every time but you guys will be the main offense in a short while you will advance towards nijou castle to be honest the number of opponents and their powers is still unclear at this point it could very well turn out to be a dangerous gamble your first priority is to rescue yasakahime once you succeed pull out immediately after all they have already announced they are using yasakahime for an experiment still there is a high chance that it was just a bluff though with cao caosattitude it could very well be true perhaps this was
the reason why he was so eager to have us involved tthen do we have enough battle power i asked though we are the main offense even with irina we only had five people recalling the battle power of the heroes faction it was clearly not enough dont worry i already enlisted some antiterrorist experts beforehand they have been the strongest reinforcements in many bloody battles against the khaos brigade with them the chances of success will be raised substantially reinforcements who kiba asked just think of them as exceptional beings for now this is good news sensei smiled happily the corner of his lips rising since sensei said so they must be really powerful right who could it be it cant be buchou or akenosan right or even the satan rangers impossible but then again in this kind of situation please come satan rangers finally some bad news this time we only obtained three portions of phoenix tears only three portions that is totally not enough and our enemies are terrorists saji cried out in terror and asked sensei yes i understand but due to the khaos brigades terrorist activities all over the world tears have been in great
demand all the strategic strongholds of the various factions have less than ideal supplies from the very beginning tears were never something that could be mass produced easily the phoenix family has been extremely busy what was originally a valuable commodity has become even more precious with jacked up prices amongst devils it has even been suggested that the rating game should amend its rules about the usage of tears you should know this as it may affect your future rating gameswow things have really become serious however this was only natural the more terrorist activities there are the more people will end up getting hurt hence as a recovery tool it was natural for tear demand to rise rather it should be said that it was inevitable sensei continued this is a secret but now the various factions have banded together and redoubled efforts to find users of twilight healing though it is a rare sacred gear it is not unique and our investigations have discovered there were several others apart from asia finding them will be a great advantage as well as denying the khaos brigade their use letting them gain powerful healers will be very unfavorable however
the current beelzebub ajuka has also been carrying out personal research on new ways of recovery thats about all i can say there is also the grigoris own research on recovery type artificial sacred gears in fact asia has been secretly helping us out on our research and promising results have been obtained repeatedly ii had no idea all along since it was a secret i guess they had to keep me in the dark so i see asia has also been helping the underworld behind the scenes what a great girl she is truly my honour and my pride asia has insisted on training all along so if a good opportunity arises will she one day become a balance breaker user i really wanted to know what she could do when that happens so thats the situation these tears will be divided to give two portions to the main offense the gremory team one for the sitri please use them with care yes everyone answered and then sensei turned to saji saji you will fight along with the gremory servants mme saji pointed at himself though it was an unexpected arrangement he immediately understood his mission dragon kingyes that
is correct your vritra dragon king state will be very useful the black flames can seal the movements of enemies as well as absorb their power just like the fight against loki last time you will support the gremory group that thats not a problem but i will easily lose my consciousness and go out of control in that state no problem ise will help you regain control like the last time against loki ise just think of some words to say during that time since you are the heavenly dragon show me how to control the dragon kings uunderstood after all ive done it once already when the time comes i will help saji irina raised her hand have the other factions been informed this was a pressing concern what was the situation now earlier i was barred from reporting to buchou of course outside kyoto large numbers of devils angels fallen angels and youkai have gathered in order to prevent the escape of the culprits a barricade has been set if possible it would be best to capture them all using this opportunity leviathansama added to senseis words and continued i will be in charge of directing and
coordinating the forces outside kyoto if any bad kid tries to run the various factions and i will destroy them though leviathansama spoke in a relaxed tone i knew that if a situation arises she can really go all out also i have contacted sona at kuou academy they are willing to provide whatever support they can offer wow president and vicepresident have also begun to take action on their side then that leaves our sides oneesama and dear juniors sensei what about our buchou and the restsensei furrowed his brow at my question yes i wanted to tell them but it looks like the time is not right they are currently back in gremory territory what happened sensei nodded in response there are reports of riots in some city located within gremory territory they have most likely gone to handle that rriots could it be the khaos brigade and only buchou and the rest of the club i was worried to the extreme but sensei gave me a wry smile they were incited by some old maou supporters it looks like there was a group which did not have direct communications with khaos brigade even so their causing trouble
is an undeniable truth so the girls have taken action after all it will be their own territory in the future also i have received news that grayfiasan was participating yes since grayfiasan is taking action those rioters can kiss their asses goodbye i dont know if its accurate or not but it is rumoured that even the current family heads wife lady gremory was present at the scene once infuriated the gremory ladies are quite a force to be reckoned with sensei deliberately shivered as he spoke ah so not only grayfiasan but even buchous mother has taken action buchou buchous mother grayfiasan knowing its those three is really reassuring perhaps because all of the gremory ladies give off such a reliable feeling ara the flaxenhaired madame of extinction the crimsonhaired ruin princess and the silverhaired queen of annihilation have gathered in one spot hmph that will teach those rioters a good lesson leviathansama happily listed out three very ominous titles extinction ruin annihilation what were these they sounded like untouchable queen or something like that the gremory ladies all have these fearsome nicknames looks like buchous father and sirzechssamas private lives must be very subdued under their wivesyou
too will have a worrisome future sensei placed his hand on my shoulder and repeatedly nodded wwhat was the meaning of that though i dont quite understand it but i will never make buchou angry pprobably sensei cleared his throat and turned to everyone once more so these are the plans i proposed i will also search for those terrorists directly from the skies so everyone will be taking their positions in one hour if you find anything suspicious report to one another immediately and try not to die until the moment you get home a school trip is still a school trip we will protect kyoto with our lives understood affirmative the strategy meeting ended with everyones response after the battle preparations i came to the lobby i had agreed to meet asia and the rest here so no one else was here yet oh sensei and rossweissesan were sitting in the seats over there sensei stood up after spotting me ise come over here yes what was it i was feeling curious when sensei took something out from his pocket it was something like a red jewel that gave off light sensei spoke it was just now there
was another molester incident just outside the hotel i happened to be on scene so i beat up the guy who wanted to fondle womens breasts and then this thing came out from his body i was thinking if it could be aa jewel from a molesters body why are you giving it to me by the way ever since we arrived in kyoto molester incidents seemed to have become especially frequent that jewel is ddraigs voice sounded out for sensei and me to hear what is it ddraig oh this came from the box and escaped from your body during the bullet train ride what what are you saying its this this jewel just as i thought we analyzed this jewel and found within it your energy sensei nodded as if his suspicions were confirmed i had reported to sensei about what happened when i dove into the sacred gear on the first day though sensei tried using his resources to help me look for it nothing came out of it i received the jewel from sensei hmm holding it in my hand there wasnt any obvious change what was going on ddraig yes no mistake about it i
can feel our pulse from it no wait what is this however ddraigs voice suddenly became depressed i have investigated a bit about this jewel the contents of the box your potential it has been passed around kyoto through all sorts of different people bby touching others breasts yyou what are you saying i began to doubt my ears as i heard those incomprehensible words but beside me sensei was laughing wryly as if he figured it out oh so thats why the numerous molester incidents these past few days it is your potential this jewel has been using people as a medium to pass around kyoto whether man or woman as long as they come into contact with this jewel they become obsessed with touching breasts rreally how can this be so the series of molester incidents in kyoto are all due to my potentialbecause i am the oppai dragon because i really love breasts so the potential carried in the box became related to breasts the first one was definitely matsuda he sat in front of me on the bullet train and wanted to grope motohamas chest and then it has been passing between different people in kyoto
and finally landed here something like that let me first apologize to all the molesters and victims actually all the molesters turn out to be victims in this case so ddraig whats the situation with this jewel after all so much has happened before it came back to me there should be something right i must have gained something right but no idea power is definitely stronger but but power gained from touching the chest of various people in this city this is this really ok your potential dont say any more even i myself have no idea who could have thought things would turn out like this to have made so much trouble for the people of kyoto isekun really must find a way to compensate all these victims who became arrested as molesters rossweissesan solemnly declared of course since they were innocently arrested they must be helped or else that would be totally unfair i will think of a way but i wonder if ises potential is trying to gather some kind of special power for example ises body contains something other than demonic and dragon power perhaps something like breast power if its ise it could very
well be possible sensei spoke softly deep in thought breast power does such a thing exist really trying to save people on one hand while creating trouble for others you truly are impossible to comprehend isekun hmmmmm i feel like vomiting despite covering her mouth with her hands trying not to puke rossweissesan was relentless in criticizing sensei sighedare you ok but this goes for you too getting all drunk and out of control and vomiting nonstop back at the hotel i feel like youre not in any position to lecture others ii dont want to be criticized by you its all because you were drinking in that kind of place in the day time oooh im puking anyway i apologize so be it are you really ok let me go to the washroom ah rossweissesan ran into the washroom after all is she really ok the vomiting valkyrie anyway as the owner why dont you hold on to that jewel ise who knows if its power might leak for some reason or other said sensei true its probably best for me to hold on to it i cant make more trouble for the residents of kyoto but then what
should i do to make the jewel react and it looked like ddraig has no idea either so ill just keep it for now welcome home my cute potential ah thats right i had one more thing i wanted to ask sensei before the battle uh sensei what is it what kind of person is cao cao i mean the one in records of the three kingdoms this was because i didnt know the records of the three kingdoms very well however if the opponent was the descendant of cao cao id better find out a bit more beforehand so how do you interpret him sensei asked me instead i scratched my face as i explained what i knew uh he was liu beis opponent a villain right he was the enemy leader who stood in liu beis waythat was the image presented in the manga and puppet shows i saw on television when i was young sensei smiled wryly after hearing my response your impressions are coloured by the novel romance of the three kingdoms though the real cao cao did kill many innocents he is responsible for important political developments and his most important feature is gathering and
developing human talent talent yes no matter their family background cao cao would use anyone as long as they were capable due to this the state of wei became a strong meritocracy the heroes factions cao cao has also set his eyes on gathering talent but ironically with strong prejudice it is reported that he recruited all sorts of special ability users however the current cao cao differs from his ancestor in his focus on humans with neither devils nor angels under him he gathers all kinds of talent but limited to humans only this is the only principle the heroes faction stubbornly maintains and is most incomprehensible and to reach their goals they will even use brainwashing to create members for terrorism to increase the number of balance breakers and develop annihilation maker through terrorism is going a bit too far humans i was a devil and my opponents were now humans in this area i seem to have accepted things quite openly in my battles what was surprising was that dilemmas like the enemy is human but i am a devil now but i used to be human too did not occupy my mind at all my becoming
a devil was already an unchangeable reality and since ive been attracted by the devil lifestyle i have embraced my new life wholeheartedly and charged forward at full speed since my lifespan was very long one day i will have to say goodbye to all my human friends and family this will be a painful thing but it doesnt mean i will hesitate when my enemies are humans the heroes faction that bunch were they humans who fought because they held deep beliefs in what it meant to be righteous or evil after all they are crowned with the description of heroes hmm it really was difficult to understandhowever terrorism is no good forcing people to do their bidding through brainwashing is too inhumane no matter what the reason from my perspective such methods were evil as i puzzled over this sensei questioned what is it not much i was just thinking about what it meant to be human and what it meant to be a devil questions i usually didnt think about and also heroes the heroes factions official members are all descendants of heroes and rival angels and devils in their physical capabilities right so what does it
mean to be a hero ah i dont mean the definition i meant in terms of their existence even as stupid as i was i knew that the word hero carried within it the meaning of being a saviour however socalled heroes what made them different from ordinary humans i have always wanted to know what are called heroes are those who possess special powers or abilities logically they should use these powers and abilities to benefit mankind through great accomplishments or to defeat great evil in other words you can say that they have to be born with the power to become heroes however these guys here are just people born with sacred gears socalled sacred gears are what god granted to certain individuals for the purpose of mankinds salvation but this doesnt mean that all sacred gear possessors will become heroes nor does it mean they will gain happiness since born with the power to become heroes is not equivalent to actually becoming heroes amongst sacred gear possessors there are many who abuse their power and become notorious people born with the power to become heroes how amazing from my perspective it sounded so enviable heroes when i
was still a human an ordinary human they were the idols i admired and aspired to be fighting heroes uh im a devil now as well as a dragon so from the heroes point of view im the villain now right have you been thinking about the question of being a devil and turning into the enemy of heroes mankind hey just think about what you want to become what do you want to accomplish sensei asked without hesitation i repliedi want to become an upper class devil to become the harem king still i will also work hard for buchou and the other servants isnt that great just work hard towards this goal you can do it right as sensei laughed things become clear in my mind ah so thats all it takes anyway one more thing i will help kunous mother thats right that little girl was now crying and suffering i must resolve this matter sensei rubbed my head gently youre fine as long as you stay like this but other than you if its asia and the others who are facing humans they might hesitate however as long as you go forward they will follow behind
your footsteps just be yourself this also matters for the growth of the other servants i see the morale of the servants depended on me understood i hyoudou issei will now advance towards the enemies with my fellow comrades i declared to sensei and then went to meet with my companions who had just arrived in the lobby as we were preparing to leave we found the sitri servants gathered at the hotels automatic doors genchan dont push yourself too hard thats right genchan we already agreed to go shopping together for the president tomorrow yes hanakai kusaka genshirou show those terrorists the will of the sitri servants understood yura please run away if it gets dangerous i have been frequently training my escape skills megurisajis companions were encouraging him ive heard that his relationship with his comrades has improved over the summer however the key relationship with the president hasnt advanced uh well im in pretty much the same situation as i sighed kiba placed his hand on my shoulder now that buchou is not here as substitute our king is you isekun rreally whaaat i am king is this possible what are you talking about youve always aimed
to become independent of buchou in the future to become king yourself under such circumstances it is natural for the servants to take orders from you right umm ummm i guess thats right for me to substitute for buchous position this was the first question entering my mind as i pondered kiba said to me during the day in the battle at togetsukyou you already gave us orders even though it was an emergency decision though your strategies and decisions may or may not have been the best possible everyone came back safe and sound so i believe they were good orders hence i would like you to continue directing us for tonight kiba he approved my immature directions that i wracked my brains to come up with at that moment xenovia joined in thats right irina asia and i can better apply ourselves when given orders though you suddenly took charge during the day you were able to get buchous team organized yes yes but isekun you were too impulsive thats no good got it thats right dont lose control irina and asia also chimed in since i only joined recently i will let isekun who is more senior
in the team be in chargeeven rossweissesan was agreeing umm no problem i guess everyone was paying attention to me giving me advice and worrying about me once again i felt how wonderful the servants my companions were ah ah buchou i wish to continue staying in this team overcoming trials and tribulations with everyone advancing always hmm i couldnt help noticing the object xenovia was carrying it seemed to be a weapon wrapped in some kind of cloth covered with magical scriptah i think i got it xenovia saw my expression and handed the weapon over for me to have a look oh you wanted to ask about this right it just arrived from the church the new and improved durandal it was the sword after all thats what i suspected since she had told me on the bullet train about durandal being upgraded by the church though i will have to use it in a real combat situation without a test run that totally fits durandal and my style itll be great i was interested in how much the sword has been powered up after all it was already renowned for its great power if it became easier
to control stamina consumption and precision will be vastly improved sorry i chatted too much saji made an apologizing gesture with his hands as he ran over to meet up with us the other sitri servants gave us words of encouragement like we will leave the offense to you guys or let us welcome tomorrow together and then we swiftly ran towards kyoto station the gremory group plus irina and saji this was the attacking team advancing towards nijou castle good lets set off for nijou castle and so we directly advanced towards the place cao cao indicated nijou castle part 2leaving the hotel we hurried towards kyoto station at the station we planned to take the next bus to nijou castle everyone was wearing the winter school uniform xenovia and irina seemed to be wearing their church combat outfit underneath if a situation came up it would be easier for them to move once they took off the school uniform oooh puwaaa rossweissesan covered her mouth with her hands battling with the urge to vomit rising from her stomach from time to time she really didnt look too well how much did she drink after all during this trip
rossweissesan had revealed many of her formerly unseen sides after we go back i will never let her drink alcohol again at the station while we were waiting for the bus something suddenly collided into my back sekiryuutei i am coming too the blond girl dressed in priestess clothes kunou wwhat was going on with her shouldnt you be staying in the youkaifilled inner capital hey kunou why are you here riding upon my neck she slapped my forehead with a series of smacks as she spoke i want to rescue my mother too hey hey hey this will be very dangerous i hope that you can stay back and wait didnt our maou shoujosama and fallen angel governor tell you already yes they did however ii want to go save my mother please take me along i beg you to beg to such a degree if i called sensei right now they would definitely send someone straight away to take kunou back to a safe place but its not like i dont understand the feelings of this child perhaps taking this child along may prove to improve the odds of saving the kyuubi leaderok i will take responsibility just
as i decided to respect kunous feelings a light mist appeared from under our feet at the same time a smooth warm feeling penetrated my entire body this feeling ive experienced it once already during the day yes this was dimension lost as i came to my senses i saw the subway train platform before my eyes the sign revealed the name of the station to be kyoto so this must be the kyoto subway station by the way we got transferred again weve been transferred like crazy today surveying the area there wasnt a single soul other than me no iisnt this the subway station platform kunou was sitting on my shoulders looks like she got transferred together with me ah looks like what happened during the day has occurred again tthen this is the alternate dimension created as the replica of kyoto those guys techniques are amazing it was just as kunou said surrounding us with mist without warning was already very alarming but who could have expected them to recreate the entire area around kyoto station just like the simulated space during the daytime my cellphone rang it was kiba he also came to this place by
the way phones actually worked hey hey kiba where are you now have you been transferred to this weird space as well yes were at the kyoto imperial palace rossweissesan and sajikun are here too youim with kunou at the subway platform of kyoto station wait a second let me check the map i let kunou down from my shoulders and took from my pocket the map that all the servants carried spreading it out on the floor of the station platform the kyoto imperial palace was here northeast of nijou castle what wait a minute this dimension can it be that vast it happens to be comparable to the size of this map which is centred around nijou castle yes this dimension has recreated kyotos vast streets with nijou castle at its centre though one wouldnt be surprised at the battlegrounds of the rating game which are equally vast it looks like the spellcaster has researched in depth the game fields of the rating game well i guess we can treat this as a rare chance for training before our next match after all there were few opportunities to take action in a space as vast as this kiba
we will set the gathering point at nijou castle ok yes understood have you contacted asia and the rest i think they have also arrived in this dimension we all seem to have been welcomed by our esteemed heroes ah i will try calling from here why dont you try calling sensei who is outside really such a sudden welcoming the conversation with kiba ended after that i was able to reach asia and the rest the church trio seemed to be together i felt relieved that asia had xenovia and irina by her side if asia was alone i would be so worried i also told them to meet at nijou castle then kiba called back again it looks like it was impossible to reach sensei outside i also tried on my end but it didnt work no matter what how strange clearly we could call one other from within but can not make contact with the outside rossweissesan explained through kiba to me that this dimension probably had a special barrier or spell preventingcommunications with outside yet allowing us to communicate with each other within it their intentions were mind boggling continuing to ponder this wasnt going to
yield any clues so let me meet up with everyone first now i must hurry to nijou castle after we toured it during the day one of the ways of returning home to the hotel from nijou castle was to take the subway from near nijou castle and then switching to the streetcar to get back to kyoto station currently all i need to do is continue ahead following the subway line to reach the station in front of nijou castle in order to make it easier to move i summoned the gauntlet and started the balance breaker countdown since we were brought here by the enemy it was only natural to expect attacks welsh dragon balance breaker red light wrapped around my body and the aura took the form of armour seeing this scene unfold kunou couldnt help but be impressed hmm though i already saw it in the daytime but the heavenly dragons armour is truly red and beautiful so this is the legendary dragon she patted my armor several times and marvelled at it greatly this curiosity was just like my other children fans though she spoke like a princess she really was a little child at
heart to think someone would take the mother away from this child no matter what the reason forcefully abducting the innocent is unforgivable kunou i will definitely come up with a way to save your mother dont leave my side i will protect kunou carefully hearing these words kunou her face went red mmmhmm that sounds about right blushing so cute but just as we bantered i suddenly felt the presence of hostility looking at the front of the station platform i found a man wearing the heroes faction uniform making his way towards me his hostility was aimed at me i must be his targethe stopped once he neared me and smiled good evening sekiryuutei remember me nope no memory at all my memory is a little bad to my answer the man smiled wryly well thats true how could you remember a small fry like me but thanks to the power i gained that time i can now fight against you the mans shadow began to move as if it had a mind of its own witnessing the scene i recalled instantly the owner of the shadows who wore a big black coat freely controlled shadows and could
transmit attacks through the shadows of others ive got it youre the sacred gear possessor who attacked me in town using shadows hearing my answer the man showed a smile very correct at that time i was defeated by you guys most pitifully however it is different now the regret fear and selfloathing from my defeat have brought me to a whole new level let me show you the real shadow skills a rustling sound i felt an indescribable sense of pressure the shadows in the area near the man the pillars the automatic vending machine etc all of them started to squirm in a way that gave me goosebumps and then the man muttered in a low voice balance break a series of rustling sounds continued the presence given off by the man strengthened and all the shadows from the surroundings gathered together to his side surrounding his body the shadows wrapped themselves around the mans entire body and then gradually those shadows took form becoming something shaped like armour over the mans bodyfull bodied armour made of shadows it was almost like my own balance breaker similar to your own balance breaker isnt that what you are thinking
as if reading my mind the man whispered joyfully yes when defeated by you guys i was filled with thoughts of increasing my defense i felt myself wanting armor like yours the sekiryuuteis powerful offensive capability truly impressed upon me this much this is my sacred gear night reflections balance breaker night reflection death cross come sekiryuutei let me avenge my defeat every part of that shadow armour began to squirm as if it was alive the shadows covered his face leaving a pair of eyes staring sharply at me it looked like the eyes of a monster next since asia was not here i couldnt use promotion really i was already unlucky before the battle began oh well this was a good chance to train let me try fighting without promotion looks like ive become more courageous perhaps from all my real combat experience the feeling of extreme nervousness has disappeared no the feeling of tension still exists and my body was trembling however this was not trembling due to fear perhaps due to fighting in the various matches and against vali loki and other strong opponents i neither feared nor faltered at the sight of my opponent entering
balance breaker after all the one i trained against every day was kiba the one whose balance breaker was the holy demonic sword boom i clenched my fists my back boosters shooting out magical power to accelerate as i charged at the enemy swinging a left i lunged at the man attacking with great speed slosh my attack passed right through his body the mans body scattered like smoke or mist and at the moment of impact there was no feeling of thepunch connecting my opponent looked completely unhurt the feeling was like penetrating mist i swiftly turned around charged at him and sent a flying kick at his back slosh again this kind of attack simply passed right through his body returning to my starting position i adjusted my stance my opponent was still totally unharmed dont bother directly attacking this shadow armour its useless the man spoke with mocking tones i see due to the shadow armour covering his entire body directly attacking him was ineffective though i understood that fact my only strength was direct attacks i sprayed the area with a series of dragon shot attacks my dragon shot disappeared when it touched the mans body
it did not attack him directly but seemed to be sucked into him i instantly had a premonition thats the guys original ability by the time i was aware my own scattered dragon shots were being fired back at me from various dark corners of the station the sound of my dragon shots approached me bastard so that kind of ability remains unchanged during that battle our attacks were also absorbed by the shadows and then released from shadows elsewhere i picked up kunou in my arms and either dodged or kicked away all the dragon shots as i parried away if i get taken out by my own attacks that would be too shameful the sound of more rustling the shadows in the station swarmed towards me as if they had minds of their own the shadows formed into sharp blades to attack me but too bad for them my armour was very sturdy this level of attack was completely not aproblem however sairaorgsan could shatter this armour with his bare fists now that kind of attack power was like a monsters just as i felt confidence a shadow entangled my left leg and was wrapping itself around and
around to tie me down at the same time a large number of shadows in the form of sharp spears were advancing i summoned ascalon and slashed apart the shadow on my leg swiftly jumping back i adjusted the stance of my body how troublesome a technique type to me it was the most difficult type to dealt with i hate those unconventional attacks which defied common sense and defenses that made direct attacks ineffective this guy had both hahahaha very good as expected of the sekiryuutei but your attacks are useless against me in a battle of attrition i have the advantage oh oh he really knows how to talk well hes right a battle of attrition will cause my armour to release when the time limit is up what should i do im being countered the magicwielding rossweissesan would be better suited to handle this guy after all eh kunou who i was carrying in one hand pushed forward with both hands and attacked the man using a fire ball technique a very tiny fire ball the man made no effort to evade and smothered it in his clenching fist this is the little fox princess this is
fox fire this level of heat can not work against me you know not hot enough damn damn it the man laughed in mockery kunous face was full of regret eh not hot enough so in other words he can feel heat despite wearing that armour this form of attack gave me an idea and so i spread out my dragon wings to cover kunou ddraig please keep kunou safe under your wings no problem but partner what are you thinking ddraig asked i took a deep breath and filled my lungs with air and then i lit a tiny fire within my belly i will win ddraig boosted gear gift transfer to the fire in the abdomen boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost transfer forming massive flames in my belly i expelled them out through my mouth boom the gigantic flames engulfed the entire station platform and the whole underground space was filled the shadows could transfer fire but the entire platform was all in flames now though the shadow armour protected your whole body from direct harm but you can still feel the heat from inside right this is the fire learned straight from the former dragon king i can guarantee its heat
completely evaporate bastard sekiryuutei the flames formed a vortex around the man defeated by the heat from the fire the man screamed as he painfully rolled about on the ground even if you can avoid direct attacks you can not evade heat from the massive flames filling up the train station i possess the sekiryuuteis armour dragons are not afraid of heat after all dragons can withstand the fire from a phoenix dragon fire from underneath the dragon wings kunou spoke softly smoking intensely the train station was scorched all black it looked like they didnt replicate the fire extinguishing system maybe i went a little too far luckily its not the real kyoto the man was lying smoking on the ground the shadow armor had been released and his body was covered with severe burnsthe presence i felt up till now had disappeared let alone entering balance breaker he likely couldnt put up a fight any more too strong even though i reached balance breaker i couldnt defeat the heavenly dragon shaking the man tried to stand up still want to fight you will die i tried to warn him for his own good but the mans body shook
as he repeatedly tried to get up despite falling over many times if i die so be it for that guy to die for cao cao is my wish i could tell he was sincere you didnt get brainwashed thats right i followed cao cao with my own will why do you ask cough cough the man was breathing painfully as he spoke clearly his throat was also scorched by the heat but he still continued you can not be unaware of the tragedy faced by sacred gear possessors i understood asia was also caught in tragedy because of that not everyone can live a happy life relying on the power of the sacred gear they are born with what do you think would happen to a kid like me who could freely manipulate shadows the man spoke in self mockery as he continued fear and oppression from others due to this power i couldnt even live a normal life but that man told me it was great to have this power cao cao he also told me being born with this power made me a talented and precious existence he told me i could become a hero if you
heard these words which changed the meaning of your life what would you think wanting to live and die for that man is only naturalthis man was pouring his heart out with his monologue was he that devoted to cao cao unfortunately that man is a terrorist and even now he has kidnapped kunous mother and is planning some kind of conspiracy perhaps he was just using you to my words the man laughed is there anything wrong with that he cao cao he taught me how to use my power and gave me the reason to live that is enough with this i can live on my previously worthless life is finally rewarded there is nothing wrong sekiryuutei i was silent as the man tearfully spoke out his deepest thoughts to us who were treated like rubbish he is the light my power is for defeating devils angels and the various gods where else can i find something like that also whether devils fallen angels and dragons they are the enemies of mankind this is common sense and you both a devil and a dragon humans can not regard you as anything but a threat a threat true seen
from a humans perspective i may be a fearsome existence cao cao that man is a person who has given meaning to life for those possessors who spent their lives in tragedy as a result of their sacred gears to this man before me perhaps it was a chance of a lifetime however his legs shaking the man stood up he slowly stepped towards me his hostility intact dont look down on us humans devil yelling he slowly approached yes i am a devil this fact will never change i clenched my fist took a great step forward and sent it into the mans face yes i am a devilcrash his face hit the man flew away backwards his back smashing heavily into one of the pillars in the station sprawling on the ground he lost consciousness i spoke softly to the fallen man due to the things you do there are those who are crying sadly no matter what your reasons are i must blow you away throwing the man a final glance i focused my gaze on the darkness in the tunnel ahead just a little more and we will reach nijou castle lets go everyone has probably
defeated their assassins and is advancing now kunou lets go mmmhmmm i carried kunou on my back spread my dragon wings and flew towards the end of the rail line part 3 gliding as i flew along the subway rail line i kicked away a bunch of attacking monster hunters and finally reached the subway station in front of nijou castle leading kunou up the stairs i reached the outdoors as i walked towards the eastern gates everyone else had already gathered sorry im late i apologized as i approached cough vomiting sounds clad in her valkyrie armor rossweissesan was leaning against an electrical pole vomiting repeatedly the 100 yen shop valkyrie the drunken valkyrie and now the vomiting valkyrieamazing throughout this kyoto trip she has been gaining so many new titles in my heart ah its great you guys are fine kiba smiled to welcome us i was still troubled by rossweissesans unusual state but it really was great that everyone arrived safe and sound oh there was some minor clothing damage but no obvious injuries it looked like everyone was attacked on the way here for the sake of emergencies kiba and i each carried one portion of
phoenix tears luckily for us but none were needed so far asia are you ok yes thanks to xenovia and irina protecting me the assassins were defeated leave it to me well its because having a healer gave us better odds already in their combat outfits irina and xenovia spoke my only worry at the time of separation turned out to be redundant well since xenovia and irina were present there was no point in worrying xenovias durandal was in a carved sheath it really gave off a different impression when kept in a sheath the offensive aura did not spread out at all does this mean the sword no longer needs to be kept in an alternate dimension rossweissesan how is she yes she was fighting the assassins perhaps the motion was too intense and she couldnt bear it kiba also didnt know how to judge the current scene crash at the same time as we gathered the massive gates gave off a great heavy sound as it opened watching the opening door kiba laughed wryly looks like they are waiting for us and the performance is about to startit is as you say they are looking down on
us as kiba spoke in self mockery i also sighed once we confirmed with one another we set off into the confines of nijou castle before he fell the assassin i defeated said that cao cao was waiting for us at honmaru palace kiba spoke as we walked honmaru palace eh within the boundaries of nijou castle we walked past the gardens of ninomaru palace and could already see the moat around honmaru palace we passed through the yaguramon20 gate that connected to honmaru palace the place we reached was full of rows of ancient japanese eaves the garden was swept nice and clean these were all illuminated by lights so even in the dark world of the night it was as bright as day i see you have defeated the balance breakerusing assassins though they only count as low or mid class sacred gear possessors they do have balance breakers after all it is surprising that you all were able to defeat them i caught sight of cao caos figure standing in the garden there were also many other members all around the buildings all of them were wearing the same old uniform as before mother kunou cried out
following her gaze i found a beautiful woman in a kimono standing there i could see fox ears on her head as well as several fox tails this must be the kyuubi leader what a true beauty mother i am kunou please wake up but no matter how much kunou cried out yasakasan remained unresponsive beneath the darkness in her eyes was a completely expressionless face kunou angrily glared at cao cao and his group contemptible you guys what have you done with motherdidnt i explain already we hope to have your mother cooperate during this time for a little experiment little princess saying that cao cao tapped the ground with his spear in that instant oooh ooh ah yasakasan began to cry painfully and her appearance began changing dramatically her body began to shine and its form gradually transformed expanding constantly the nine tails also began to blow up in size oh the giant golden beasts roars reverberated across the night sky before our eyes a massive fox monster had appeared so big at least ten metres tall she was probably about the same height as fenrir her tail was divided into nine and overall she looked even bigger
than fenrir this was the legendary youkai the ninetailed fox fenrirs figure had slim shoulders and a narrow waist and was beautiful as a drawing but the kyuubi leaders form was just as entrancing tanninossans dragon poise was also very cool do all legendary monsters have such charming figures no matter how you look at them those eyes had no emotion at all she must be being controlled are we able to persuade her will we have no choice but to fight yasakasan in her current state i questioned cao cao sternly cao cao making this replica kyoto and controlling the kyuubi leader what kind of conspiracy are you planning cao cao tapped the shaft of the spear against his shoulder audibly as he answered the existence of kyoto itself is actually a large scale magical device surrounded by powerful leylines the various places known as famous sights are the power spots abundant in spiritual youkai and demonic power the ancient yin yang masters onmyoji hoped to mold the city itself into a kind of massive power well precisely because of that all sorts of existences have been attracted to this place our current pseudo space islocated in the dimensional
gap both infinitesimally close to and infinitely far away from kyoto at the same time the power of the leylines is now flowing here as the strongest level of existence amongst youkai the ninetailed fox is said to be on the level of the dragon kings in power the relationship between kyoto and the ninetailed fox is also intricately linked in a variety of ways that is why our plan must be carried out here exhaling cao cao continued with shocking words using kyoto and the power of the ninetailed fox the plan is to summon great red to this place this would normally require a dragon gate as well as multiple dragon kings but gathering several of them by force is virtually impossible even for god and buddha so kyoto and the power of the kyuubi will have to do as substitutes wwhat are you saying great red why do you want to summon that massive dragon that fellow all he wants to do is swim and fly around in the dimensional gap but he is harmless to everyone right correct that dragon is essentially harmless but to our boss his existence is an obstruction it makes going home
very troublesome ophis ophis appearance as a young girl floated into my mind the boss of the terrorists from the perspective of the three great bible factions an existence like a final boss to fulfill her wish of returning to the dimensional gap but doing that could cause adverse effects to the entire world its no joking matter so you are going to summon great red and kill it cao cao shook his head at my question well maybe we wont go that far anyway we will catch it first before we decide what to do there are so many unknowns with its existence and there is so much to be learned for example what effect the dragon eater will have on the apocalypse dragon anyway no matter what its just an experiment to see if we can summon a powerful existence the dragon eaterit was a term i heard for the first time i was surprised but for sure it will be an ominous character i dont understand these things but i am sure bad things will occur after you capture that gigantic dragon also the kyuubi leader must be returned i had hardly finished my sentence when xenovia
had already pointed her sword at cao cao the sheathed durandal the various parts of the sheath began to move and transform woosh with a violent sound the mobile portions of the sheath began releasing a large amount of holy aura it covered the entire length of the sword and the massive aura shaped itself into a blade this is the new durandal the offensive aura was not affecting the surroundings but was wrapped around the sword instead even standing next to it i could feel the powerful pulse of the aura from behind my armour i see so the new durandal has combined with its sheath the sheath was keeping durandals power in control very well like ise said your conspiracies may be very deep but no matter what you will bring disaster to us and the people around us eliminating you all right here is the best solution kiba nodded and agreed with xenovias declaration of war i also agree with xenovias opinion me too in response irina created a sword of light in her hand its always a battle to the death when the gremorys are involved saji sighed as he spoke sorry saji this kind of
stuff is what we get into all the time fine this is for everyone at school and my friends anyway many black snakes appeared from sajis arms legs and shoulders and began to entangle his body as his body was covered entirely with black snakes a large black serpent also appeared under sajis feet the massive serpent presented itself next to saji and formed a coil its whole body emitting black flames sajis left eye turned red and resembled a snakes eye sajis presence was unbelievable sensei you upgraded him way too much this this guy even in normal mode was completely different from that time during the rating game in the underworld vritra im sorry but please lend me your strength hyoudou please support me from the side today we will fight to our hearts content as saji muttered huge black flames appeared all around the huge serpent began to speak in a deep voice ah my other self where is the prey is it that holy spear or that fox either is fine its been so long since i last appeared i feel great right now how about this no matter who let me just consume everything with
my black flames wow what a scary speech this snake of flame by the way its consciousness recovered to the level of acquiring speech eh so this is part of the dragon king a completely different feeling of pressure compared to tanninossan its a bit scary and horrifying it was said that vritra excelled at capturing the power of opponents just as i was about to order ok lets capture youkaiform yasakasan first at that instant wooooosh it was the sound of xenovia raising durandal to the heavens and a massive aura gushing forth from the blade expanding to over fifteen metres tall in an instant the blade of holy aura appeared before my eyes it looked as if it was about to pierce the heavens sooooooooo long sooooooooo cool sooooooooooo amazingbefore the durandal plus ascalon combination also produced a great aura at the time there was a pulse of spiritual energy like a pillar of light but its nothing compared to the current spectacle but then this time the offensive aura was not diffused or spreading around like before i could see that most of its power was concentrated together i say xenoviasan the battle is just beginning are
you trying to break the rules by attacking early again strike first and end the battle taste my sword as if retorting against the protests in my heart xenovia smashed her massive sword of holy light and aura down upon the heads of the hero faction like the felling of a heavy log the new durandal crashed down to crush them crash a massive aura pulse engulfed buildings structures and the entire scenery the ground split into two the resulting tremor caused everyone to fall to their knees after the attack the entire area was a total mess the massive aura attack had also crossed over nijou castles moat and even destroyed outside buildings and roads further beyond leaving nothing behind shocking what devastating offensive power hoo xenovia took a deep breath and wiped the sweat off her forehead with her hand durandal returned to its sheathed state once again was it over with just a breath and whats with that mission accomplished face using a final finishing move at the very start no no perhaps this might be a good result hey xenovia isnt that going overboard for a first attack i was a bit emotional as i spoke
but xenovia simply made a victory sign with her handthe opening always requires such a strike so the battle with loki also required such a sudden strike as well hey hey hey talking to her was useless relax despite what it looks like i did adjust the power if i felt like it i could have swept everything clean my goal is actually to achieve something like your full powered dragon shot but it doesnt seem to be that simple yes your kind of power type is exactly the ideal battle style that i seek dont just go yes and be done with it im not some kind of destruction freak this person was clearly a knight but only seeking power completely contrasting with kiba perhaps she should have been better off as a rook xenovia tapped the new durandal this new durandal is the result of combining with excalibur using alchemy with excalibur really irina began to explain let me explain basically they used all the excalibur pieces possessed by the church to create a sheath to cover durandals blade excaliburs power allowed durandals offensive aura to be contained in addition excaliburs power can attack at the same time
as durandals allowing their powers to amplify each other and thus producing deadly destructive power irina pointed at the destroyed wasteland i see so excalibur not only restrains durandals aura it and durandal also amplified each others power so by combining the two holy swords into one was how such a strong attacking power was produced yes isekun the fact that durandals aura could be applied to other holy swords heaven has already started related research on that ah during the match in summer xenovia kept durandal in an alternate dimension but could still wrap its aura around ascalon in the battle torecover asia she used the mutual amplification effect with ascalon to raise the power of both their auras yes yes the heaven faction came up with the idea of a new durandal starting from that time irina spoke as she nodded ha the union of excalibur and durandal into a single holy sword but then didnt the church only possess six of the seven fragments so they only used six to make that sheath xenovia raised her sword and muttered to herself ex durandal this is the new name i give this sword ex durandal a name without
objection it was similar to the old name definitely it should be a name like this well if they could be beaten in one hit then wed have a much easier time xenovia shifted her gaze forward i see i didnt think those guys were inexperienced enough to be taken out by one attack clatter from out of the rubble in the wasteland the surface of the ground an arm rose up a piece of earth was lifted and out emerged many members of the heroes faction covered by a thin mist all of them looked a bit dirty but completely unharmed did that mist defend against the power of the holy sword the huge man whose arm was the first to appear was roughly two metres tall and was flexing his neck loudly behind him cao cao tapped his spear audibly on his own shoulder they were unaffected by xenovias attack well without that kind of power they wouldnt have been able to undertake terrorist activities against the various factions cao cao rubbed his chin and laughed ah not bad at allit was a joyful tone that came from the depths of ones heart you guys can already hold
your own without disadvantage against the bulk of the upper class devils no the top servants of the upper class devils sister of the maou you sure have gathered a group of excellent servants once you start participating officially in the rating game you should obtain a double digit ranking in no time and reach the top in a few decades what a bright and glorious future shalba beelzebub really underestimated you guys that guy was a complete fool siegfried smiled wryly at cao caos words being bound by anachronistic pride they couldnt see the new generation rising up to replace the old thats how id put it this is why vali did not lend his assistance and let the old maou faction perish anyway how should we proceed after taking that attack just now my excitement feels a little bit funny oh right then lets start the experiment cao cao tapped the ground with his spear the kyuubi leader began to glow what was going on focus power into the force nodes of the ninetailed fox and prepare to summon great red georg understood on cao caos orders the youth wearing a magestyle robe over his uniform georg reached
out with his hand what seemed to an endless number of magic circles appeared around him magical script and numbers began to spin rapidly within the circles matching rossweissesan in terms of the number of magic circles summoned from a rough glance at those magic circles i can see norse demonic fallen angel style black magic white magic fairy magic quite a diverse array of spells rossweissesan narrowed her eyes and spoke softly a somewhat amazing mage but that guy was the mist user not only was he a longinus possessor he was also a powerful sorcerera massive magic circle appeared underneath the kyuubi leader that magic circle though its appearance was different i felt some of the crests to be familiar yes last time when sensei woke up that enormous dragon king the consciousness of midgardsormr the magic circle then was very similar roar as she roared yasakasans pupils dilated her eyes gave off a dangerous light and her golden fur stood on end it was clearly an abnormal situation this was going to get dangerous if it continued the mist user who is also a mage spoke the magic circle and the sacrifice for summoning great red are
ready the next step is to see if great red gets interested in the power of the city and takes the bait luckily we happen to have a dragon king and a heavenly dragon present as bonus my apologies cao cao but i will be occupied with operating the magic circle it is a very taxing thing cao cao waved his hand at the mages words in acknowledgement got it whats next then annihilation maker leonardo and the rest are battling the allied forces outside i wonder how much time they can buy reports say that not only the fallen angel governor and maou leviathan but even members of the seraphim have arrived jeanne heracles yes yes oh stepping forward in response to cao caos call was a blonde foreign lady wielding a slender sword and the giant man from just now they are the ones who have inherited the will the spirit of the heroes jeanne darc and heracles siegfried who do you want to fight at cao caos question siegfried drew a sword and pointed with the sharp tip of the blade kiba and xenovia watching this scene unfold the lady called jeanne and the giant named heracles
laughed then ill take angelchan shes pretty cutei will pick the silverhaired lady then though she doesnt look very well they all exchanged glances kiba and xenovia vs siegfried irina vs jeanne rossweissesan vs heracles that leaves me the sekiryuutei how about vritrakun over there cao cao looked at saji saji strengthened his flames but i stopped him with my hand saji your opponent is the kyuubi leader you must find a way to release her so i get the monster battle understood hyoudou dont die how can i die you do your best too no matter what i already promoted to queen before i came i am full of battle spirit from the start as we encouraged each other sajis body was surrounded by tall black flames and then the flames began to spread outward and grew increasingly bigger in size vritra promotion the flames reached up into the sky the jet black flames gradually shaped into a body forming a long serpentine oriental dragon roar the massive black dragon roared facing the kyuubi leader saji had successfully transformed into the dragon king the black flames arranged themselves into a magic circle and began releasing a dark cloudy aura
it is said that there are many strange components to vritras powers and some of them were used to great effect during the battle against loki though the species are different lets hope it works against the kyuubi too asia watch over kunou yes kunou can i leave asia in your protection leave it to me but ah i understand leave your mother to me we will save her i made a thumbs up in response to kunou at the same time i spread the dragon wings on my back the one i faced was cao cao the leader of the heroes faction the man holding the ultimate longinus really why does it feel like i keep having to face these boss level opponents all the time now well fine you are you stronger than vali i asked cao cao happily smirked and shrugged who knows but for sure im not weaker than him though i am a frail human dont joke around anyone who can face sensei can not be weak hahahaha thats true but isnt that sensei super strong i think im still slightly inferior oppai dragon as we started our battle with words there was an instant
of silence and then howl roar saji and the kyuubi leader had begun the monster battle the black flames danced as they surrounded yasakasan the flames suddenly shook violently as the kyuubi leader released an aura from all over her this seemed to be causing her great pain was this the power absorption seen from lokis battle if this continues perhaps the battle can end without injuring her just as i thought how convenient it would be the kyuubi leader suddenly spat out large amounts of fire from her mouth though not as powerful as tanninossans flames but its still packing quite a bit of firepower i could feel the heat even through my armour unless the opponent was on a similar level these flames will surely roast them instantly into charcoal vritraform saji also spat out black flames and the two massive fireballs collide in mid air above honmaru palace causing a huge explosion at thesame time the black flames immobilizing yasaka also vanished the giant monster battle not seen since loki was continuing fiercely damn it i cant use the flame barrier as effectively as last time against loki concentrate my other self to use my power a
high level of focus is required but then thats not all though powered by kyoto the kyuubis massive youkai power is very strong but that mages magic circle is also producing some strange barrier effects those spells are a little complicated very troublesome its like it is interfering with my power neutralizing my flames the combination of kyoto the kyuubis power longinus as well as magic even if you want to drain the kyuubis power her youkai powers are instantly being refilled by the flow from kyoto if this continues it may very well be us to fall first sajis conversation with vritra could be heard through boosted gear the kyuubi leader kyotos flow of power the magic circle all of them were huge obstacles to handle so many opponents all at once was really troublesome need my transfer i asked using my sacred gear perhaps using my power saji can use the power of the dragon king to demolish the magic circle dont since he still can not control my power fully in this state if you add the sekiryuuteis power he will only go berserk he can only master the characteristics of my powers through battle experience there
is no other way vritra answered understood saji do your best if the situation gets dire i will try my best to help you understood then kick those guys asses quickly too leave it to me as we communicated over the sacred gears vritra and the kyuubi leader continued to breathe fire at each other massive fireballs collided in midair once again bouncing off each otherthe battle of fire created a windstorm sweeping over the entire area but both the gremory group and the members of the heroes faction stood their ground facing off against their opponents now that saji has claimed the opening battle it was our turn to shine kiba xenovia let us fight a bit further away i want to get the kyuubi leader as far away from these bastards as much as possible understood the two of them answered and began to change the battlefield siegfried pursued after them clash clang with the sight of silver flashes and the scattering of flying sparks kiba and xenovia started their battle against siegfried using a three sword style siegfried handled kiba and xenovias sword strikes with the minimum of movements counterattacking with sharp and deadly thrusts xenovias ex
durandal looked like its sheath could be adjusted to reveal the blade for normal combat lets use another one xenovia grabbed a part of ex durandals sheath with a mechanical sound the sheath transformed and revealed a hilt xenovia held the hilt and pulled separating it from ex durandal what was thought to be only a hilt ended up producing a sword blade wwhat is going on did the new durandal keep additional swords within it then could it be one of the excalibur fragments this sword has way too many features turning into two sword style xenovia adjusted her stance and raised the speed of her sword strikes seeing this siegfried laughed this is getting interesting wonderful time for me to show off slash siegfried made a wide swing with his demonic sword kiba and xenovia evaded and temporarily retreated for now gloomsiegfrieds body gave off a kind of pressure that was hard to describe it gave a chill to ones back and the murderous intent was expanding balance break on siegfrieds back out grew another three additional silverscaled arms wow it was just like asura the new arms drew out his three remaining swords a sixsword style the
demonic swords tyrfing and dainsleif as well as a sword of light for devils despite how i look i used to fight for the church you know a sword wielded in each of six arms that truly was the stance of the asura this is my chaos edge asura ravage as the subspecies of twice critical the balance breaker is also a subspecies the power is simple multiplying arms a useful enough ability for one like me who only uses technique and demonic swords to fight lets see how far you two can keep up kiba xenovia just as i worried for the two of them irina had begun an intense battle with that lady called jeanne o light ha irina spread her pure white wings and aimed several spears of light at jeanne from the sky what an acute attack the sizes of the spears of light were also very large if a human or an ordinary devil got hit they would probably blow up immediately however these attacks were lightly dodged by jeanne that lady sure was fast though inferior to kiba it was enough to be a challenge for eyes to follow not bad angelchans attacks are
very direct oneesan is very touched why is she so cheerful jeanne swung her rapier and deflected irinas attacks of light then eat thisirina flew down from the air and charged straight at jeanne holding her sword of light high she slashed down at jeanne however jeanne stood her ground taking on the attack directly clang the sound of metal colliding as the two were caught in a deadly battle they were even jeanne smiled confidently she must be planning something holy sword as jeanne summoned a sword grew out from under her foot irina was surprised but she managed to evade to the side as jeanne took the opportunity to thrust forward with her sword irina spread her feathered wings and retreated to the air not bad at all yes looks like i underestimated you thats my angelchan ddespite appearances i am the ace of michaelsama leader of the angels do not underestimate me is that so michael got it then just like sigkun its time for oneesan to show off jeanne fluttered her eyes sigkun was that siegfried show off could it be like siegfried she is going to oneesans ability is blade blacksmith the holy sword version
of that holy demonic sword wielders sacred gear holy swords with all kinds of attributes can be created at the current rate it seems that my holy swords are not going to win however dont you believe in the existence of exceptions the lady smiled elegantly so jeannes sacred gear was the holy sword version of kibas this was something i should have known after all kiba could create holy swords as a result of reaching balance breaker however exception an ominous premonition filled my mind and then it came true balance breaker crashfrom beneath the feet of the lady who smiled adorably a huge number of swords holy swords gathered together into a stack violently those holy swords seemed to be forming a giant object appearing behind jeanne was a massive dragon made up of an uncountable number of holy swords this child is my balance breaker stake victim dragon like sigkun its a subspecies jeanne smiled while irinas expression was serious the holy maiden jeanne darc this feels complicated to be fighting the one who inherited the spirit of the saint but i will fight for michaelsama and everyone peace is the most important wow she has raised
her sword of light and renewed her determination irina you have to do your best kaboom boom at the sound of numerous explosions rossweissesans battle of demolition against the giant heracles was in full swing what no damage from being hit by magical attacks rossweissesan released a whole stream of magical attacks but heracles took them straight on with his body laughing madly hahaha great this magical attack tastes just right laughing being hit by rossweissesans norse magic bombardment he could still mock his enemy as if nothing had happened no he did get hurt though the wounds were tiny his entire body was covered with wounds by the way taking such light damage from all those magical attacks just how sturdy is his body boom every time heracles punched with his fist an explosion was created its like he was holding bombs in his hands when he attacksrossweissesan nimbly dodged causing heracles iron fist to miss hitting a tree behind instantly as the explosion was heard the tree turned into dust my sacred gear is variant detonation which makes my targets explode when i attack i suppose i could continue like this smashing your magic with my fists like
a fireworks show but seeing everyone else going balance breaker ill probably get nagged if i dont go with the flow sorry i will enter balance breaker and defeat you right away heya balance break the giant gave off a loud roar and that huge body began to give off light the light gradually formed thick objects on the mans arms legs and back as the light faded the man heracles entire body was covered with numerous protrusions these protrusions were shaped something like missiles no no can it be this is my balance breaker mighty comet detonation heracles took aim rossweissesan rossweissesan aware of his intentions began taking evasive manoeuvres to distance herself at this rate this place wont be safe with a bitter expression rossweissesan quickened her pace in the direction away from honmaru palace rossweissesan was trying to avoid us from getting hit by the missiles explosion haha what a great woman trying to draw my attention to avoid getting your companions caught in the explosion fine i will get duped this once heracles happily laughed with excitement having left honmaru palace rossweissesan turned around in mid air and conjured numerous magic circles heracles missiles were prepared
to fire and he shot them all at once like im going to let you succeed i aimed at heracles direction with my left arm and prepared to fire dragon shot in the instant that heracles fired his missiles i will strike down as many as possible but just as i was about to fire dragon shot hey your opponent is mecao cao swiftly appeared in front of my left arm fine you can taste it yourself fire the dragon shot left my hand crash cao cao lightly lifted his spear and deflects my arm upwards dragon shot fired out of my hand and disappeared into the sky at the same time heracles numerous missiles flew towards rossweissesan kaboom as the innumerable missiles struck the magic circles conjured by rossweissesan a massive explosion was created in the air the violent wind swept across the entire area appearing out of the smoke was a figure looking closely rossweissesan was covered with wounds but she landed in a stable manner despite the defense provided by the rook and her defensive magic she still suffered significant damage worse of all her magic which could take out a city seemed to be ineffective against
this heracles did this giant surpass rossweissesan in both offense and defense or did he have some kind of advantage in attacking and defending against magical attacks no matter what the first priority was to recover rossweissesans injuries asia recover i gave the order to asia smack the green aura was sent to rossweissesans body asia had fired her healing aura towards rossweissesan rossweissesan made a thumbs up as thanks looks like she was almost completely healed well done asia ha recovered well thats all right with meheracles also seemed to have happily accepted rossweissesans recovery what a battle maniac heracles began to run charging in rossweissesans direction damn it no matter who all these bastards are going balance breaker every one of them as if he read my thoughts cao cao laughed joyfully isnt it great this is a balance breaker free for all without a little inflation how can humans compete with you supernatural existences as cao cao spun his spear in his hands i distanced myself slowly though it looked like there were many openings i knew that rash attacks will be countered it was only my instinct but that guy was most likely a master of
techniques if i attacked recklessly then like just now cao cao will use the smallest movement to parry and render the attack useless this was very scary arent you going to balance break like the others i asked but cao cao shook his head no need no need we can win without going that far however today is my chance to really have a good look at the sekiryuuteis power looks like we are being looked down upon however it doesnt sound like a joke ah i was just thinking about how to draw our power and have a satisfying battle this guy is just like vali the relaxed version of vali while the other guy uses force to measure my power this one here is watching my every move with amusement cao cao raised an index finger my companions came up with a theory on how to defeat you the proposal was to attack you with a time accelerating sacred gear the balance breaker timer will be shorted and the armour will release prematurely we already have such a sacred gear user and is very effective against sacred gears with time limits like yours accelerating time in an instant
to waste the time limit however it has no offensive or other special abilities just time limit control still targeting the time limit will be adecisive blow against you however that is probably not enough to defeat you what was he trying to say i couldnt discern cao caos intention behind telling me this you have been trying to enter the depths of the sacred gear to understand it for example if you were to release balance breaker voluntarily and switch to using the normal ability of power doubling every ten seconds along with the accelerated time what would happen you would become a horrifying existence that could multiply power in an instant of course it is still unknown whether the time acceleration effect will affect the normal mode sacred gear if it was applied during balance breaker but for someone like you who has reached the depths of the sacred gear it was very possible what on earth are you trying to say i couldnt help asking cao cao shrugged what im saying is rather than using these indirect manners its probably best to defeat you with direct attacks you have a great wariness of technique types so i
was thinking those types might not be able to handle you yeah right it was me who cant handle the likes of you we just met and yet youve already analyzed me so thoroughly this man was really scary but then hyoudou issei you have two decisive weaknesses the dragon slayer as well as light dragon and devil possessing these two attributes can make you more deadly but naturally at the same time it increases your number of weaknesses these weaknesses are very conspicuous to me it makes me feel like wanting to prove to the world that a truly invincible being does not exist well thats enough talking lets begin cao cao raised his spear and pointed the sharp tip at me then i must begin to fight the first was promotion knight or bishop to power up dragon shot no better stop trying to train on a real battlefield lets go all out asia promotion to queen yes with asias approval i promoted to queen power flowed into my bodyever since last time i have insisted on training all along i have already reached the point where i could make use of the traits of the various pieces
then let me show off the results of my training right here i spread my dragon wings ejecting magical power strongly from my back boosters goooooooooooo jet extending my fist i used my extreme speed to give cao cao a punch after considering many plans in the end a straight punch was best i accelerated strongly forward cao cao spun his spear dexterously and lightly dodged to the side just before my fist struck he can handle my charging if so i changed trajectories with my boosters and charged once again in the direction that cao cao evaded i gathered magical power in both hands predicting the instant cao cao will dodge i was going to fire dragon shot at that bastard whack cao cao kicked my right hand as he parried the left hand with a sweep of his spear once again dragon shot flew off to nowhere bastard neutralizing my attacks with the least possible movement clang just as i was getting annoyed there was something at my abdomen lowering my gaze i found cao caos spear firmly embedded there gurgle large amounts of fresh blood was rushing up from my abdomen and spewing out of my mouth
i i lost youre not weak but your style of rushing in directly has too many openings sizzlecao cao slowly withdrew his spear from my abdomen in that instant my abdomen no my entire body was engulfed by the intense pain with the wound as the centre my entire body began emitting smoke iit really hurts wwhat was this a feeling identical to holy swords the smoking wound was also the same oof course its the holy spear so the pain and effects are damn it my consciousness is growing faint isesan smack the green aura surrounded my entire body the pain in the abdomen gradually subsided it must have been asia who sent me the recovery aura just at the right moment just now i really was about to lose consciousness however the wound was still open and smoking a bit no way it looks as if it is about to expand again was it because the healing provided from a distance was not strong enough asias distance healing was very effective but still inferior compared to her direct touch still long range healing was already very powerful but the holy spears damage seems to have exceeded it i
took out the phoenix tears from my shirt pocket and scattered them over the wound on my abdomen the wound finally closed wow as expected of phoenix tears did you know you almost died just now pierced by the holy spear you were almost erased death is surprisingly simple no cao cao laughed lightly you said i almost died just now really yes it was a critical wound right in the belly but ive had had similar in the past and i could still move i was even thinking of sending a punch to your face as a counter almost erasedwas it referring to devils disappearing without trace from holy attacks i was in that state just now smoking all over my body my existence was about to disappear realizing that i had reason to shudder tthat was really dangerous if i died just like that i couldnt face buchou and asia ever again cao cao tapped his shoulder with his spear is is that this guys habit whatever thats not important anymore remember this well that was the holy spear just now no matter how powerful you become you can never overcome this attack because you are a devil
even if its vali as long as he remains part devil the holy spears damage is absolute lesson learned better stay away from that spear next what should be done cao cao saw my response and was taken aback ah you didnt get scared i was thinking it would be fun to see you cowering in fear ah of course im afraid but i wont be scared off i wont be able to face everyone if i dont give you a punch to the face being the sekiryuutei is not easy ah hahahaha cao cao suddenly laughed out loud what is this guy his facial expressions have been changing rapidly how nice this i can sort of understand why vali likes you so much now interesting vali youve finally found a good opponent using his fingers to wipe away the tears from his laughter cao cao opened the front of the spear creating a blade of light come crackle the pressure from cao cao intensified looks like he is full of spirit this is getting more and more scaryi extend my right hand preparing to fire off the strongest dragon shot boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost boom i fired a massive blast at cao
cao if this hits my body it could get dangerous cao cao prepared to parry the attack with his spearbut i already anticipated it at the instant of firing i activated the back boosters and jumped aiming at the moment cao cao parried the dragon shot attack i sent him a punch from the side cao cao raised his spear high and with a giant swing splitted the massive dragon shot in half like cutting a watermelon what the hell do i care about that let me punch him with my right fist while he is swinging his spear down boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost punching cao cao with my boosted fist i feel the power of your hidden potential cao cao happily declared and swiftly turned his spear to parry my arm now the right fist was actually a feint the right fist stopped in front of cao cao his parry missed i pushed forward my left fist at the same time transferring power to ascalon in the gauntlet boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost transfer i made ascalons blade appear from the gauntlet then i jumped backwards immediately at the same time as i jumped i emitted a pulse of aura from ascalon bang as ascalons aura
flew towards cao cao it seemed to have exceeded his expectations he made no effort to evade slice with a rough noise cao caos left arm was flying in the air ascalons attack has severed his arm success feint after feint and then the real attack within another feint the training with kiba finally came to fruition i declared victory in my heart yes no matter how powerful the spear nor numerous my own weaknesses that guy also has his own weakness the frail body of a human in terms of durability of the body i had the clear advantage as a devil and dragon though cao cao and the heroes faction are much tougher than ordinary humans they are surely more vulnerable than vali and loki as expected i can win if not then i can still put up a fight cao cao stabbed his spear into the ground and caught the falling left arm with his right expressionless he held the left arm with his right armpit and took out something from his pocket as i wondered my gaze focused on a familiar looking bottle thats cao cao opened the lid to the bottle and poured the liquid
over the wound and connected his left arm to the spot smoke rose from the wound on the left arm then everything was restored as if nothing had happened that bottle no mistake about it phoenix tears wwhy do you have something like that i questioned and cao cao laughedblack market as long we keep certain channels open all it takes is money im sure the phoenix family definitely does not want these to fall in our hands how could this happen as an important recovery tool for the devils the tears were already extremely precious but to have them fall into the hands of terrorists countless victims suffering painfully from your attacks could have been saved if only they had the tears due to anger your aura has increased letting your aura fluctuate due to emotion did you know that it could bring destruction in certain circumstances that was the reason you entered the juggernaut state once none of your business bastard these guys they really stick their fingers in too many pies crack at this moment my armour crumbled what was this just as you were jumping back i happened to make a few strikes with the spear
though there seems to be a delay it looks like a few simple attacks can wreck the sekiryuuteis armour looks like i was attacked without even noticing ddraig im sorry but i leave you with the repairs understood however most likely due to the effects of the holy spear restoring the armour will take time really how much does that spear counter me a very good attack strong looks like i may need to raise my sacred gear a bit cao cao that bastard looking so happy if only a hit landed i will win of course if that guy gets a hit in i could very well die too just as i was agonizing over how to deal with cao caos holy spear irinaasias sorrowful cries were heard ara you guys are still going at it a womans voice glancing over it was jeanne carrying the bloody body of irina in her arms irina well it is the sekiryuutei should put up a better fight than these guys siegfrieds voice held in his six arms were kiba and xenovia all covered in blood as well hey hey if only i got to fight the sekiryuutei huge heracles threw down
something in front of me rossweissesan her body dyed red with fresh blood eeveryone how can this be theyve all met such fates roar i heard a roar vritra was entangled by the kyuubis nine tails and roared out in pain even saji cao cao tapped his shoulder with the spear sorry sekiryuutei looks like this is the end strong you are all very strong this is already exceptional amongst devils but this level of power can not win against us who hold the power of heroes in our hands also for devils fallen angels dragons and youkai to be uniting as enemies of humans isnt that too scary wouldnt humans feel threatened resisting is only natural it is only normal for humans to defeat maou and dragons this is the principle behind our actions we of the heroes faction well whether for me or the other members here that is one of our goals anyway georg hows the magic circle the mist user nodded in response to cao caos question still a while but will great red really come even if it doesnt we will get data on why it didnt come well try other methods if that happensstill
making this all work will mean a heavy price are you sure we are doing this at all costs dont look at me if possible of course i want a good result these guys theyve forgotten about us and were now occupied with the matters of the experiment jeanne siegfried and heracles left my companions here and then started talking with cao cao everyone asia ran to everyone over here and began to heal her tears flowing incessantly in my mind were the promises we made before coming here we will protect kyoto with our lives sensei i couldnt do anything i glanced at kiba lying on the ground now that buchou is not here as substitute our king is you isekun kiba though you said that but i couldnt do anything mother please wake up i am kunou kunou is here mother kunou cried as she spoke to her mother but the kyuubi leader didnt even look at her your motheryour mother will be saved by us did we save anyone wwe didnt accomplish anything xenoviasan irinasan asia continued to heal weeping what was i doing why did i become such a pitiful sight even though i have restored
boosted gear scale mail cao cao and his group did not even glance at methough they felt we were strong but they didnt think we were enough of a threat to reverse the current situation to be viewed like that even though we tried our best it was too from the very start to them we were just on the level of entertainment a side dish for the experiment this truth brought me great pain hhow can i call myself the sekiryuutei what oppai dragon what a joke unacceptable my body trembled within the armour tears of regret streamed down without end why was i so weak always so powerless at critical times like this why was everything always out of reach by that little bit no matter how hard i tried there were still so many opponents i can not catch up to was this my limit why am i i knelt on the ground knocking on the surface with hate and regret my companions have all been downed by them and my chances of defeating cao cao are even just saving kunous mother the chances were zero no i can not give up i dont want things to
end here i must continue to fight but there was no way to win i regretted it and the pain filled my heart crying someone spoke to me from within my body this voice belonged to elshasan yes thats right why are you crying i feel so regretful why am i so weak this is clearly a critical moment but i failed again yes it is regrettable but did you forget the fallen angel governor once mentioned you are the embodiment of possibilities at this time azazelsenseis words were awakened in my mind yes it was just before the battle with lokii believe in your possibilities all the past sekiryuutei were devoured by power until they died no exceptions perhaps you may be the least talented sekiryuutei however you reached balance breaker using female breasts you returned from a berserk state through female breasts i feel that someone like you can be described as the embodiment of possibilities embodiment of possibilities oppai dragon oppai dragon isnt it such a cool name has a dragon ever received such a unique title though your body and demonic power compares poorly with vali and other past possessors but from another perspective you have
your own unique method of using the sekiryuuteis power to become strong from now on it will be fine as long as you work hard and persevere as well as put in a little thought to discover key techniques yes that is what sensei told me at the time i can at least use my unique way to apply the sekiryuuteis power because i am the oppai dragon yes now thats more like you current sekiryuutei oppai dragon the possibility belzard and i saw come release it all now your possibility shine a bright light emitted from my shirt pocket i took it out to have a look and it was the jewel giving off red light tthis was raise the jewel to the sky and summon loudly ssummon just as i wondered elshasan announced loudly thats right go summon the breasts that belong only to you in that instant shiiiiiiiine the jewel became even more brilliant and gave off an intense light that illuminated the entire surroundings what is going oncao cao noticed the light and turned to look amidst the light emitted by the jewel something appeared those things gradually took on human form one two they began
to multiply wwhat is this elsha answered my question the jewel has been transferring amongst all sorts of humans in kyoto and these figures are formed from their residual memories the figures of all the poor innocent men who became molesters due to me the number of figures multiplied easily exceeding a thousand what kind of molester surge did this jewel produce in kyoto thats far too many people i have to apologize to oppai ooppai ah oppai lots of oppai many many oppai the lingering memories began to repeat oppai over and over again hey hey hey when did this become a hentai exhibition oppai oppai oppai oppai as the huge number of figures all chanted oppai in a low voice they slowly and casually shuffled their footsteps and entered some kind of formation oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai oppai this is going too far i couldnt help but exclaim at this strange spectacle the lingering memories repeated the word oppai as they looked like they were about to perform some kind of ceremony oppai zombiescao cao spoke softly thats right they looked just like zombies did people who got their
chest fondled by the people who had become molesters due to the jewel get infected and turn into zombies clones from lingering memories arranging themselves in a circle the oppai zombies melted into the ground next light moved about within the circle to carve out symbols in the centre forming a massive magic circle the oppai zombies turned into a magic circle the series of shocking events had left me completely puzzled but elshasan said to me everything is ready summon wwhat all these incomprehensible things have killed my ability to think the breasts that only belong to you breasts belonging to me the first image that floated into mind was that crimsonhaired oneesamas go yell it out summon breasts i couldnt keep up with the rapid developments do i really have to yell it out summon breasts boomthe magic circle gave off a bright light the word oppai spelt out in the magical script and within the magic circle were even the characters for breasts summon could it really mean for me to summon that image in my mind something appeared in the centre of the magic circle with a flash of light what appeared inside the magic circle
was crimsonhaired buchou bu buchooooooooooooooooooooou in the middle of changing clothes she was wearing only underwear noticing the change in scenery oneesama lifted her head to look around and got a big shock of course wwhat is going on honmaru palace kkyoto aara isnt this ise why are you here and why was i brought here ssummoned eh eh buchou was in an awkward situation i was so surprised i couldnt speak even the heroes faction were staring speechless unable to react sorry for something so incomprehensible to happen i am very confused too with full seriousness elshasan spoke to the confused me go ahead poke uh i couldnt help but doubt my ears just now i heard something that could not possibly be heard and then elshasan spoke to me again please poke her breast ppoke thats right poke just as usual poke it with a pochitsu sound with a pochitsu no no what will happen if i poke what was this person suggesting are you really the strongest female sekiryuutei this oneesama i fear you have gone mad ignoring my astonishment elshasan continued this is the final switch to opening your possibilities in other words rias gremorys nipple
this is the switch the switch to open the doors of your potential no way youre mad come on this is beyond my imagination elshasan buchous nipple can not be the switch to my awakening no this is the switch to your awakening please understand i truly believe this after observing you closely all this time too far those words have gone way too far but why do they sound so convincing as i struggled pondering buchous body began to give off a golden light wwhat is it now i am surrounded by light buchou was beset with shock followed by a troubled look but something incredible was happening before my eyes flash twinkletwinkletwinkle buchous breasts were flashing with some sort of holy light elshasan that is rias gremorys breasts have come into contact with your possibilities and entered a new phase next next phase hoho those breasts have exceeded the limits the frontiers of the switch princess is entering the second phase sorry i dont understand what second phase all sorts of incomprehensible things were making me cry just touch it and you can change you will realize a dramatic change the power of the evil pieces within your
body will be liberated with one touch press switch nipple spurtnose bleed i finally understood i get the situation now i walked over to buchou withdrew my mask into the helmet and smiled ise buchou tilted her head with an expression of surprise while i solemnly said to her buchou please let me poke you in the breast my frankness made buchou speechless however she only thought for a moment before she said i dont quite understand but still i get it amazing she understood my words how did this situation come about it has become incredible though i tried to ridicule myself with incisive derision but there was nothing else that could be done then go ahead and touch yes touch it touch it in kyoto poke buchous breast poke buchous nipple since letting others see her own nipples would be very embarrassing buchou shifted her position so others could not see and took off her bra click as the clasp was released the voluptuous breasts were liberated all at once as i noticed the change to those so very familiar nipples i couldnt help but be surprised the pink areolae and nipples were emitting a faint peachy glow
areolae giving off pink light what kind of situation was this wwas this caused by the second phase amazing i am an idiot for trying to figure out these complicated things now then all i need to do is touch it for immense benefits yes yes breasts can glowreleasing the finger portions of the gauntlets i extended two fingers and poked forward aiming at those shining nipples thinking back when reaching balance breaker i also poked these breasts and awakened it felt like i obtained something every single time i touched these breasts it was truly thought provoking amazing buchous breasts are amazing no matter what happens everything can be solved using these breasts switch switch princess buchou is also evolving perhaps she will really become the switch princess are you ready ddraig ooooooh oooaaaaaaah oooooooh ddraig began to sob loudly there was nothing left to do but cry sorry im sorry partner but i have to poke not poking is impossible i have a reason i must poke here i come i declared loudly as i nosebled while touching breasts feeling that incomparably soft sensation from the breasts and the nipples watching the fingers sink into the breast all
these sensations travelled all over my body giving my brain the highest pleasure hoo buchous final exhalation gave me a critical hit ka buchous breasts suddenly gave off a bright light this this is ahahahah buchou could not help screaming at this extraordinary development as buchous breasts gave off light she rose into the heavens and the whole space is illuminated with a pink glowamazing buchou buchou shes ascending to heaven her breasts were still flashing with light i couldnt help clapping my hands together in respect my eyes tearful ah breasts as buchou rose into the sky and disappeared the light and the magic circle vanished as well eh eh elshasan where did buchou go back to where she came from really buchou was summoned all the way to kyoto just for that what the heck when i get back i will have to prostrate myself and apologize what the heck was that cao cao and his group were stupefied what happened has exceeded their comprehension of course they wanted to summon great red but got buchou instead beat i felt an intense beat from my heart beat again in a loud voice it was its coming go forth
as elshasan raised her voice red light overflowed from the jewels all over the armour warmth could be felt coming from within the body like some kind of overflowing power spurting out can not be suppressed is this the power sleeping within the sacred gear is this juggernaut no no theres no feeling of terror rather it was some kind of energy pulse never felt before but it has a certain feeling of nostalgia ddraig this is i feel it too partner how nostalgic this is my original aura unlike the power from juggernaut driven by extreme emotion there is no curse ornegative emotion this feels like the time when i still had my material body when all i cared was to simply fight the white one to determine the victor ddraigs voice was full of happiness and joy though i didnt know what had happened to ddraig but the red aura was now bursting forth from my entire body covering me and the entire surroundings part 4 once i regained my senses i found myself in the white space what was this phenomenon i should be fighting at honmaru palace in nijou castle and then two people appeared in
front of the confused me elshasan and a fashionably dressed man this was inside boosted gear so only my consciousness flew here to this point i still couldnt understand what has happened but elshasan smiled and said your door is open now this is the alternate path different from juggernaut elshasan i am truly grateful for just now it felt like it was something important so i went ahead with reckless abandon despite my surprise this is good we also bet everything on it because what you seek are breasts iis that so well i do seek breasts very often belzard and i can now pass on pass on could it mean thats right we exist here only as residual memories its about time for us to be free from this sacred gear do you mean to die we died long ago what remains here are just some memories not even souls is this beyond common sense and so we plan on disappearing bbut i still have many questions for elshasan and need more advice elshasan shook her head at me you dont need us because i really have no interest in breasts only you can cause all these strange
phenomena by touching female breasts yes yes sorry i am the oppai dragon youll be fine as long as you have ddraig and your companions go current sekiryuutei though the curse of the sekiryuutei has not been fully lifted it is something that will be resolved in time if its you im sure the rest of the lingering memories will be liberated elshasan i i was touched and was overcome with mixed emotions of gratitude and appreciation and my tears almost flowed out amongst the past seniors there actually existed someone who cared so much for me were leaving belzard give him some final words the man known as the strongest sekiryuutei ever belzardsan was smiling at me precious advice i beg you nodding his head belzardsan reached out with his index finger click click zoom zoom iyaaan for an instant i completely failed to understand what he was trying to express looks like hes satisfied lets go belzard elshasan spoke as she smiled wait wait what were those parting words from belzardsan what is that look of satisfaction click click zoom zoom iyaaan no way arent those the oppai dragon song lyrics oh no the two of them were
slowly fading away in the whiteness of the background i cant believe it the parting advice from the strongest senior were words of gratitude just like that the two of them were waving goodbyeyou must have better advice to tell your junior and so elshasan and belzardsan disappeared satisfied with my breast fetish is that so i understood now to become the sekiryuutei almost all were weirdos part 5 after all im just a hentai those were the first words i yelled out as soon as my consciousness returned to the real world my mind was about to collapse lets go boosted gear in tandem with my yelling the red flashing light surrounding my body began to give off a massive aura power gushed out without end from the depths of my heart from within the body it flowed from the sacred gear so this was ddraigs original power combined with the negative emotions of that berserk state known as juggernaut it became that dangerous power but now was different those negative emotions could not be felt right now and my consciousness was intact ah yes i finally remember why did i forget yes it was god the original power
of albion and mine that god sealed ddraig spoke sounding like he noticed something anyway lets talk later first lets beat these guys right here right lets show them this power of mine which hasnt been used for so long go sekiryuutei use our power the possibilities of the gremory servant use it all desire diabolos determination dragon disaster desecration discharge many voices sounded out from the jewel which began to repeat the sound of d as if it was broken dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd the way to use the new power flowed into my mind hahaha amazing beelzebubsama the traits of your adjusted evil pieces have been strengthened by the sekiryuuteis power possibilities mine ddraigs from now on our possibilities due to the interruption just now queen had been released promotion was required again but asias confirmation is not needed i yelled out loudly mode change welsh blaster bishoppromotion to bishop of course this was no ordinary bishop as i steadied my footsteps red aura gathered on the shoulders and the back to take form a backpack formed on my back whereas on my shoulders two massive caliber cannons were formed buzzzz starting up quietly the sekiryuuteis power began to concentrate in
the barrels of the cannons magical power was raised due to promotion to bishop plus the newly awakened power the backpack was filled with an extremely large amount of aura a massive high energy blast was being prepared that is very dangerous cao cao muttered he seemed to have noticed the concentration of power in the cannons thats right a direct hit from these cannons will vaporize anything this was my wish as i gathered power kiba xenovia irina rossweissesan saji my most important comrades to hurt them like this and then to ignore us that regret that impotence i felt let me fire all those emotions back at you energy concentrated in the cannons boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost disappear dragon blaster booom the shoulder cannons fired releasing an extremely massive blast even as i tried my hardest to maintain my footing i could not stop the impact from the recoil and it sent my body backwards i used all my strength to stop myself from flying awaythe high output energy was fired into
the midst of the heroes faction interesting i will take this shot legendary dragon heracles stepped up in front was he trying to take my attack dont take it evade cao cao yelled and used the base of his spear to hit heracles away from the line of fire cao cao and the other members then swiftly escaped my attack without hitting anyone the cannon blast continued flying onward far away behind them kabooooooooooooooom a large explosion shook the entire space while the city in the background was engulfed by the gigantic aura the energy continued to spread surrounding the entire city with intense light as the bright light faded nothing was left the cannon blast eliminated the entire scenery and even the game field was affected and the artificial dimension began to show signs of distortion destroyed the whole city hey if he keeps firing this dimension wont last heracles finally understood the power of my cannons and cried out in surprise distorting the simulated dimension yet this place was constructed to be sturdy what kind of firepower was that siegfried stopped smiling and narrowed his eyes hehe let me take my revenge however this has not ended cao
cao i yelled that guys name and released the cannons on my back the released cannons dissipated into particles of light coming right up this was only the beginningi adjusted the evil piece system within my body yes i need speed this time unsurpassed speed let me imagine myself as kiba visualize the knight mode change welsh sonic boost knight smack i spread the dragon wings and flew towards cao cao the boosters on my back were doubled and spewed out great flames of magical power i streaked across the sky as if causing the air to shake not fast enough i needed speed faster than he can follow sonic speed high speed god speed armor release as i yelled various parts of boosted gear scale mail were shed off heavy armour was cast off from the body arms legs and helmet abandoning all excess baggage keeping the minimum armour to fly boosted gear scale mail shaped itself into a set of delicate full body armour giving up on defense further shaping the armour into a slender form for high speed my wish is god speed speed no one can follow enduring the vomiting feeling from the heavy gforces i
flew through the air with god speed this must be the world seen by kiba and vali honestly my body still hasnt adapted to such speed however i can still continue if all i need is to charge into you that is absolutely not a problem boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost i had cao cao caught in my sights and was going to charge straight from the front very fastcao cao entered a stance with his spear and readied an attack good lets decide the victor directly straight and to the point that suited me the best smash i crashed towards cao cao with god speed damn cao cao vomited lightly i grabbed cao cao and continued flying finally caught you no objections now as i spoke that guy laughed happily who would have thought you really charged straight from the front but then can that thin armour resist my spear sorry but i just raised its power lets end this thats right if my current armor is struck by your spear it will end
instantly probably erased the instant contact was made but i already knew that very clearly i understand i adjusted the evil piece system once again mode change welsh dragonic rook now what i needed wasnt speed it was overwhelming offensive and defensive power red aura gathered around me restoring the lost armour however the aura didnt stop with regenerating the original form it went beyond to create even thicker armour a heavy shield massive amounts of dragon aura concentrated on my arms this must be double no five or six times thicker than the usual gauntlet losing god speed due to the mode change cao cao and i continued flying through the air from the momentum cao cao aimed his spear and the blade of light approached me piercei used the thick gauntlet on my right hand as a shield and received the spears attack the holy spear struck the gauntlet but stopped halfway and did not penetrate my gauntlet completely so ill need to increase the output to destroy this armour this level is already enough to vaporize an upper class devil instantly against the yelling cao cao i raised my huge left fist the fist was aimed perfectly
and definitely will not miss go ddraig go everyone dont look down on the oppai dragon you bastard boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost i smashed my massive left fist towards cao cao in that instant cao cao withdrew his spear from my gauntlet and used it to block as a shield damn it crash as the fist hits the spear percussion hammers appeared on the elbow of the armour as massive amounts of aura were pumped out it massively increased the impact of the punch from the air i smashed cao cao towards the ground smash taking my attack cao cao fell towards the surface of the ground in the moment before he fell and after receiving my attack cao cao was smiling the impact of his fall broke the ground surface creating a massive cloud of dust and dirt ending the close quarter combat in mid air i landed in my heavy armour rustle in that state my heavy armour turned into mist and scattered in the windha ha i began to pant and
fell to my knees what remained was the intense feeling of fatigue the stamina consumption was truly enormous from the current situation it also felt like my armour was nearing its time limit i have received a new power that is the ability to promote to other evil pieces according to my own will without the kings consent and then in conjunction with the power released by the sekiryuutei it brought me frightening levels of magical power speed offensive and defensive capabilities promoting to bishop will raise magical power and allow the firing of a super powerful form of dragon shot the knight sheds excess weight to become a set of high speed armour using it together with the sekiryuuteis new power it gave me unbelievable speed finally the rook was completely opposite to the knight equipped with heavy armour with strengthened offense and defense this required giving up on speed the knight the rook and the bishop the power to freely use these three amplifying their traits to the limit though it does reduce other abilities as a trade off at the current level of output it was not enough for the queen if i forced the promotion the
power will either make me go berserk or it will disperse because i couldnt bear it beelzebubsama provided the key with the help of the adjusted evil pieces the original power of the sekiryuutei ddraig was awakened this was the state of my liberated possibilities the door was wide open all that remained was to keep charging forward but the stamina consumption was quite severe if used in succession i would be out of magical power instantly partner due to the liberation of power the balance breaker countdown has further decreased the total balance breaker time has also lengthened however stamina consumption has increased in particular due to changing modes continuously this will be lessened as you get used to it is that so ddraig so i still have plenty of room to train well awakening was also something that could be achieved to this extent through hard work by the way this power cant be used in the rating game ignoring the kings presence and promoting forcefully beelzebubsama also mentioned it well its ok for real battles so i will keep using it as i slowly got up my sight was caught by cao cao who stood up as
well bastard he can still get up after taking my direct attack no just before it struck he used the spear to defend so he can still endure cao cao stood up from the massive trench dug up by the impact of his fall his nose and mouth were bleeding cao cao wiped the blood off and audibly flexed his neck so this is the sekiryuutei pardon my earlier embarrassment it looks like you have obtained great power at a time of desperation if i didnt defend with my spear i would have died then youd better go die damn it truly the ultimate longinus that guy was fighting with a normal body and i should be winning in a direct confrontation is this a new characteristic you obtained outside the rules of the evil piece system this is almost like an illegal move i expressed doubt at the term ive never heard before illegal move cao cao replied to the question that leaked out of my mouth this is a term in chess referring to irregular moves against the rules that attack you did is clearly illegal in the evil piece systeman illegal move it really was like the
words described that power can not be used in a match this power gives me the feeling of the triaina ddraig expressed his opinion triaina what does that mean triaina is the threepronged spear of the ocean god poseidon in greek mythology better known as the trident i felt that the series of attacks from the three evil pieces was as intense as the triaina itself illegal move triaina not bad this name i will be using it illegal move plus triaina not bad at all then i will call this series of attacks illegal move triaina lets try this name for now once i master the power of the queen lets think of a new one how terrifying in terms of direct offensive power this rivals vali without juggernaut no vali is improving every day i wonder how he is now thanks for the praise even i myself dont think i have caught up yet that guy is a genius that attack should have consumed more stamina and aura than expected you are also far from mastering it no even if you master it its consumption will still be significant by my estimates ten minutes of balance breaker remains
at most damn thats almost the right answer this guy analyzes so completely of course im not going to tell you how much time is left i will fight till the end i sighed and said to cao cao you are really too tough to handle i thought you were underestimating us but you were still calmly analyzing all this time no it was my stupidity to have underestimated you slightly my apologies as one who has gained knowledge of the secrets of the sekiryuutei yet does not revel in great power you truly are a formidable adversary i must go back and reflectcao cao tapped the spear on his shoulder how exhilarating i havent felt this way ever since the last time i dueled with vali truly fighting legendary dragons is the best this is also proof that i am the descendant of heroes exhilarating i hate all these battle maniacs when can i build my harem and live peacefully are you planning to have a total war with all the factions like this cao cao shook his head at my question youre mistaken this kind of team is not suited for long term warfare though individually we are
strong we can not stand against the allied forces yes we will inflict heavy losses upon them but we will be eliminated targeting vulnerabilities with sudden attacks is far more efficient so i will continue to stay in this kind of organization so he had this kind of reason for staying under ophis how sly there must be other reasons too bzzzz bzzzz a noise began to rock the dimension ive heard this sound before its the sound of space being sliced open looking up at the direction of the noise there was a hole being formed tthis is it appeared in my mind the image of the giant red dragon in the dimensional gap looks like its starting cao cao happily laughed tthen great red has been summoned using the kyuubi leader and the magic circle perhaps that magic circle plus your massive power attracted the true dragon to here cao cao spoke in mocking tones what because i raised my power georg prepare the dragon eater ritual cao cao stopped midway in his words he narrowed his eyes and stared at the dimensional gap with a questioning expression wait thats not great red thats plus this touki21 roar
appearing out of the dimensional gap was a massive slender oriental dragon a few dozens of metres long thats not its not great red wwhat was that dragon exuding a green aura as it gracefully flew in the night sky it was quite a dreamlike sight cao cao began to yell its the mischievous dragon yulong22 yulong i remember that was one of the five great dragon kings though cao cao was surprised at the arrival of the oriental dragon his gaze was not focused on yulong but the figure on the dragons back i also looked in that direction over there was a tiny figure ah that figure has fallen off the back of yulong no wait he jumped from that kind of height the tiny figure completely ignored the height and landed on the ground what a massive flow of youkai ki as well as the flow of domination due to these the entire capital city is full of strange fluctuations the short figure had an elderly male voice and approached us slowly step by step so tiny his figure was really short a child he had the height of a kindergarten school child his fur gave off
a golden brilliance a monks cassock gradually took form over his body he really looked like a monkey face was all wrinkled by the way his skin was black a youkai a monkey youkai carrying a stafflike weapon prayer beads on his forehead and wearing shades with a cyber design he smiled with complete confidence while smoking a pipe hey its been awhile holy spear user that damn kid finally grew upthe monkey old man spoke to cao cao cao cao smiled almost closing his eyes the great victorious fighting buddha i wouldnt have expected you to come ive heard that you have been thwarting our efforts all over the world kid your pranks have gone too far it wasnt easy for me to get assigned to have talks with the kyuubi leader on behalf of the heavenly emperor and here you go kidnapping her there are heroes who become gods and then there are heroes whose descendants poison the world tyranny and domination only lasts a single generation isnt that saying correct cao cao poison to be called poison by you i am honoured i could see that cao cao treated this old man with reverence as they spoke
by the way the entire heroes faction seemed to be gazing at the monkey old man with great seriousness or should i say tension it seemed like they were under heavy pressure by the way the heavenly emperors messenger the heavenly emperor was sakra right then the one the kyuubi leader was going to negotiate with was this monkey old man to be the messenger this must be a very powerful monkey whos that that monkeylike old man probably sun wukong23 and the first generation as well kiba had finished healing and spoke as he walked over to me iiiiiits really him kibas words surprised me from the bottom of my heart ffffirst generation sun wukong that monkey old man is the famous one from journey to the west really amazing yes thats right sensei mentioned reinforcements he must have noticed my gaze and the monkey old man smiled with his creased lips sekiryuutei boy you worked hard thats a pretty good dragon pulse however you dont have to push yourself any more i am the reinforcements just leave everything to this old man yulong i leave the kyuubi to youmonkey old man sun wukong gave orders to the flying
yulong in the air and then the dragon king yulong expressed dissatisfaction hey hey giving orders to dragons just like that damn old man just getting here made me super tired anyway what happened to the hakuryuukous witch companion wow look its vritra hey hey hey the one fighting with the fox is vritra its been how many years very enthusiastic that dragon havent changed at all iis that so ddraig first gen puffed his pipe and spoke you can eat your fill of kyoto cuisine later hows that thats a promise old man you have to treat me to some delicacies later ah dont look down on the dragon kingsama fox lady i am very amazing complaining yulong began to take on the kyuubi leader ok sorry to the red fellow but i will punish cao caos descendant now first gen walked towards cao cao siegfried extended his arms and launched a surprise attack at first gen siegfried dont take him on if its you though cao cao tried to stop him siegfried happily rushed in monkey boss if its that sun wukong then i have no objections to such an opponent extend staff crash as he spoke calmly
the staff in first gens hands rapidly extended in length easily sending siegfried flying crash crash crash crash crashwith one hit siegfried was sent flying into a pile of debris sso very strong wwhat is going on this monkey old man defeating siegfried with one hit even kiba and xenovia with the new durandal couldnt win you are not ready to be my opponent young demonic sword user not enough strength in that waist youd better train again start with jogging as first gen eyed siegfried yulong wailed at this time ooh wawawawa hey damn old man this fox is quite strong yulong has been entangled by the kyuubis tails iit was a tough match by the way this dragon king was really enthusiastic pull yourself together you are a dragon king right first gen sighed as he spoke amongst the dragon kings i am the youngest and also the liveliest you sure know how to argue you are that youngest dragon king who first proposed retiring the instant you ended your most illustrious battle use your youth to pull through understood i will try my best ah they reached an understanding just like that they sure were good partners
the dimension lost user released the magic circle binding the kyuubi and extended his hand towards first gen it looks like compared to summoning great red handling this monkey old man was more important capture and bind mist the mist from before began to surround first gen and gathered by the justice of heaven thunder sealing the dragons jaw prostrate upon the ground thudfirst gen chanted the spell and then tapped his staff on the ground once and the mist dispersed he broke through that kind of mist just like that your sacred gear training is very weak you should enter in a dialogue with it like that red dragon over there hows that ah i am being praised so happy the mist user was very surprised of course he held the power of a top tier longinus but it was completely ineffective ting cao cao saw an opening and extended the blade of his spear planning on ambushing first gen with one finger first gen blocked the spear come on can this be real he defended against that spear just like that not a bad attack but only this youre still young at the level that can be stopped
by my finger it is impossible for you to eliminate the other gods and buddhas whether you or the mist user neither gave a serious attack dont underestimate me hearing first gens words cao cao laughed i see that monstrous strength still exists we keep hearing how strong you were in your younger days but how is it now to cao caos question first gen simply shrugged his shoulders fearlessly siegfried picked himself up from the rubble and said to cao cao cao cao its over sun wukong is famous for stopping khaos brigade operations numerous times if we continue to attack recklessly valuable talent may get injured i was too naive he is ridiculously strong hearing that cao cao put away his spear time to retreat eh choosing the wrong moment could result in grave injuries smackthe hero faction swiftly gathered in one spot and the mist user started activating a giant magic circle conjured under his feet it was a transportation magic circle theyre trying to escape cao cao left behind some words lets call it a day first gendono gremory servants as well as the sekiryuutei hope to see you next time wait dont think you can
escape tto do this during our school trip as well as taking kunous mother i gathered aura forming a cannon on my left gauntlet packing my remaining power into that cannon i focused on this one attack buzzzz with a quiet sound energy gradually gathered in the gauntlet cannon a massive attack is not needed just hitting that guy is enough first gen smiled at me you will complete my mission sure thats fine ill let you punish that kid it will only be for a short while but i will raise your power first gen lightly tapped my armour with his staff and then aura flowed forth from my body is this the power of sennjutsu my body did it ever have this much aura no was it sleeping much thanks monkey old man with this i have enough to fire the cannon i locked the aim of the cannons barrel onto cao cao you think you can return without any punishment this is my gift to you your souvenir from kyoto boom a dense blast of magic was fired from the gauntlets cannon arrogant bastard heracles and jeanne stepped forward planning to shield cao cao there i imagined
sirzechssamas magic in my mind that unending stream of attacksno no i dont need to reach the level of those kinds of movements just change the course of the projectile bend as i yelled i liberated my imagination in my mind in that instant the cannon shot changed trajectory and bent around heracles and jeanne smack the surprise attack hit cao cao right in the face oooh ooh ooh red smoke was rising as cao cao covered his face it made a bend i made my attack swerve there really was plenty of room for improvement so if i wanted i can change the direction of dragon shots i had already fired the battle with sirzechssama was not a waste cao caos right eye bled but he still stared over here his face was stained red that guy was covering his right eye and showing an expression of mad glee my eye was sekiryuutei raising his spear cao cao began to chant powerful words of an incantation o spear the true holy spear that even pierces god absorb the tyrants ambition sleeping within me blessing and destruction will be siegfried covered cao caos mouth and held him down cao cao
stop chanting it is too early to reveal the balance breaker of true longinus truth idea these words made cao cao calm down and he took a deep breath and then siegfried said retreat annihilation maker leonardo is also at his limits at this rate the outside members can not bide time much longer after all we already gained a lot of valuable data and obtained very good experiencesiegfried stared at first gen it looked like he could still make an attack like just now cao cao stared at me with his left eye what a sharp gaze what kind of stare was that understood first gen and the sekiryuutei no hyoudou issei please allow us to take our leave really i cant laugh at vali any more i am in the same state you always manage to rile us up at the very end was he talking about that battle at kuou academy with vali the light from the magic circle intensified just as he disappeared cao cao said to me hyoudou issei become even stronger stronger than vali if that happens i can show you the true power of this spear leaving behind these words cao cao and
the heroes faction disappeared from this dimension in the instant they vanished fatigue gushed forth even maintaining the armoured state was taking all my effort heroes faction cao cao the ultimate longinus all were so mysterious i can only say this the heroes faction especially that man were frighteningly strong after the heroes faction escaped those left behind were us and sun wukong and yulong who came as reinforcements as well as the kyuubi leader ah so tired if vritra was not here it would have been a hassle yulong landed and took a deep breath the kyuubi leader had been stopped by yulong and the recovered saji vritra after that saji had returned to human form but passed out on the ground and was now receiving asias healing thanks for your hard work sajihowever the kyuubi leader did not return to human form and currently her pupils were still gray and had not recovered consciousness mother mother kunou cried as she called for yasakasan but there was no response now what should we do though i can use sennjutsu to remove the evil ki presence it will take a long while puffing his pipe first gen was considering other
solutions then he thought of something and looked in my direction red kid you seem to have a strange power that can listen to female breasts what how did he know was my power that famous ah if he watched the rating game match video then its not strange for him to know eh eheh yes its true good then i will assist use the technique on the little girl and the kyuubi lady over there use bilingual on those two what could he hope to find out by asking their breasts though i didnt understand i used my remaining magical power to produce that mysterious territory of breasts sending power into my mind raising lustful thoughts to the max and then releasing the ability go bilingual i used the technique on kunou and yasakasan at the same time i released my armour just doing these tasks spent all my magical power confirming the technique had activated first gen twirled his staff and tapped the ground in that instant creating a strange space covering the breast territory we were in the surroundings seemed to be spinning constantly and my sight was getting blurrythis is a creative use of your technique
red kid altering it to allow heart to heart telepathy a dialogue between the little girl and her mother first gen spoke to kunou kunou nodded and closed her eyes and then i heard kunous voice in my heart mother mother can you hear me mother it was kunous voice my heart was filled with her voice mother please return to normal i beg you please however yasakasan was still unresponsive tears streamed down kunous face as she continued i wont be stubborn any more i will eat the fish i hate i wont fly out of kyoto at night any more so please please go back to the usual mother please forgive kunou mother what a depressing plea kunou continued apologizing many times to yasakasan at this time ku nou it was very faint but i definitely heard that voice kunou lifted her head and began calling out again mother kunou is here please sing that song to me again please teach me to dance again kunou kunou will be a good girl from now on i want to be with mother in kyoto i want to live together in kyoto flash a gentle light surrounded kunou and then
the light began to cover yasakasan the kyuubi leaders body began to glow and slowly shrank in size as the light disappeared yasakasan had regained the size of a human wonderful back to normal i couldnt help but raise my arms and cheer this place isyasakasans body was shaking which was worrying however even though her consciousness is still a bit fuzzy at least she came back kunou ran to yasakasans side jumping into her mothers bosom she cried continuously mother mother yasakasan tenderly embraced kunou caressing her head what is it kunou youre always such a crybaby damn i am crying from this touching scene ohkunouchan this is wonderful finishing everyones healing asia was also crying ah ah this was truly a touching scene its wonderful kunou confirming that yasakasans sanity has been restored first gen announced the incident as having come to an end well no matter what this incident has been resolved and so the fighting was over as the battle to rescue the kyuubi leader ended after many twists and turnsmaven the intense battle had come to an end and everyone returned to the real world gathering on the roof of the hotel we were staying
at sensei placed his hand on my shoulder and said you really did it ise go rest now medical team please carefully examine the gremory servants as well as irina and saji they shouldnt be injured much but are severely depleted in magic and stamina sensei gave directions to other staff senseis kind thoughts were a blessing so tired to the death definitely wont be able to enter balance breaker again tonight the battle ended with the retreat of the heroes faction after their intense fight with dimension lost and the antimonsters the various factions which had participated in the kyoto barricade were now handling the aftermath however the heroes faction was able to slip past the barricade and escaped just from this fact it can be seen that the heroes faction were very troublesome opponents it seems like they used the annihilation maker kid to create a large number of monsters as a diversion which allowed the heroes faction to break through and escape when we got back everyone was virtually falling over my legs shook and i could hardly stand it was total exhaustion asia was also tired out from healing her companions and the tension of the
battle falling asleep as she leaned against my body everyones healing treatment had finished but just to be safe we were being wheeled away sorry isekun i was too useless just now kiba apologized as he said to me i waved my hand its the effort that counts genchan genshirouthe sitri servants accompanied saji who was lying on a stretcher their eyes full of tears of worry turning dragon king consumed a massive amount of stamina and saji had lost consciousness after the battle since he didnt need to dialogue with me to stay in control it seemed like he was working hard saji has grown by the way saji you are also one who is loved by your companions after that i also received buchous call i reported back briefly but will need to give a full explanation when i get back am i going to be killed just as i was deep in my dark thoughts monkey gramps the first generation sun wukong walked over kid ah yes you seem to have obtained your own power a great power different from the juggernaut what a good boy juggernaut is a silly trick its simply power out of control
pure violence and then you die kid you have a girl important to you right after all you are the one called the oppai dragon i im being praised what an utmost honour to be praised by the protagonist of the journey to the west anyway about girls first gen pointed at asia no hahahaha eh eh i guess so then dont make her cry you are the type who will become strong for dreams and girls also the sekiryuutei and the hakuryuukou are already concentrations of power even if you dont rely on juggernaut you can strengthen to any degree however you are still in danger first gen stared at my face nodding i didnt understand what he meant but first gen simply puffed a breath of smoke and laughed also that idiot from my family has caused you trouble my apologies ah thats bikou yeah he sure was troublesome our buchou is furious from that switch princess nicknamefirst gen rubbed my head emotions will bring forth juggernaut remember that and that last hit on cao cao was an excellent attack you should work hard in that direction never let up on dreams and hard work next as the
sakra messenger mission finishes i will go find that idiot hanging out with vali i will teach them both a lesson take care jade dragon lets go over to the kyuubi got it damn old man bye ddraig before their voices subsided first gen and the jade dragon had already left far away left behind alone i clenched my trembling hands they were already numb this was evidence of fatigue the dormant power in the sacred gear has combined with the evil pieces to become my new power there was still plenty of room for improvement and training needed to begin anew sairaorgsan vali and cao cao i wont lose and definitely i will become stronger much stronger i believe one day my dreams will come true elshasan belzardsan though we parted in a most ridiculous manner but please continue watching over me from wherever you are as the sekiryuutei as the oppai dragon i will do what i need to do on the last night in kyoto i gazed up towards the sky and renewed my determinationnew life part 1 on the last day of the school trip perhaps due to the exhaustion of last night we were still
tired after a nights rest we of the gremory group had to drag our tired bodies out of bed to finish shopping for souvenirs on the final day though rushing around made us pant we finally saw the kyoto tower souvenir shopping done it was time to leave kyoto on the kyoto bullet train station platform we were being sent off by kunou and yasakasan sekiryuutei kunou smiled and called my name holding yasakasans hand just calling me ise is fine hearing my words kunous face went red and shyly asked ise are are you still coming back to kyoto ah yes definitely a series of high pitched noises the sound of the train about to leave echoed across the platform kunou shouted at me you must come back kunou will always wait for you ah yes together with everyone next time you need to show us the hidden side of kyoto yes hearing our exchanges yasakasan spoke azazelsama sekiryuuteisama as well as all the devils angels fallen angels my apologies i wanted to thank you all i am prepared to meet and have talks with leviathansama and the victorious fighting buddha i havealways hoped that everyone can turn the
situation around and strengthen cooperation and never let kyoto be terrorized again ah i leave things in your hands leader of the youkai sensei smiled shaking hands with yasakasan but suddenly leviathansama placed her hand on top of theirs ufufu everyone return for now afterwards yasakasan the monkey ojichan and i will enjoy the very interesting kyoto together leviathansama looked very happy it seemed like she was going to stay for a while in kyoto and have further talks with the youkai after a few pleasantries everyone got on the bullet train on the platform kunou waved her hand and called to me thank you ise everyone we will meet again we also waved to kunou with a rushing sound the bullet train door shut though the train had started kunou continued waving kyoto the four days and three nights trip from setting off to now so much had happened in such a short time kiyomizudera ginkakuji kinkakuji arashiyama nijou castle other than that there were lots of memories lets come again to reunite with kunou and yasakasan next time lets bring buchou and everyone ah i suddenly thought of something i forgot to ask yasakasan to show me her
breasts as a reward damn it and i worked so hard so much happened that i forgot damn this must be the kyoto air messing me up nooooo kyuubi breasts i hung around the door crying out in regret part 2having returned from kyoto we were being lectured by buchou in one of the rooms of the hyoudou residence we were all kneeling asia xenovia kiba and who knows why irina was also reflecting due to travel fatigue rossweissesan had returned to her room to sleep it seemed like she had consumed a lot of stamina being a teacher must be hard work and combined with her drunken vomiting buchou had her eyes half closed as she interrogated us why didnt you report to me is what i would like to ask but we did have issues in the gremory territory does sona know yes yes we explained everything that could be explained nevertheless akenosan and konekochan were also angry when i called you i had hoped you would discuss things with me thats right how could you treat us like that but but everyone came home safe gasper youre helping me what a good junior oh well ise was
getting friendly with a new girl there sitting on a chair sensei casually added fuel to the fire what are you trying to do and its the kyuubis daughter are you talking about kunou hey hey hey no its not like that really sensei youre saying it in such a bad way no just look at yasaka and youll know that girl will surely grow up to be a great busty beauty right i imagined kunous future appearance yes the breasts would be very large mmaybe so but still i already said im not interested in shorties smash i was hit by konekochanouch why nothing is is that so konekosamas heart was impossible to understand oh well rias ises power has also made a giant leap why dont you cut him some slack sensei finally helped a bit buchou also sighed and nodded that i am very happy to learn that but being suddenly summoned to kyoto and brbreasts buchou stammered as her face went red its that incident it also gave me quite a fright everyone else who heard about it couldnt believe it but thanks to ddraigs tearful explanations they were finally convinced what an unbelievable development buchous
breasts returned to normal and stopped glowing that was such a shock i didnt know breasts could give off light by the way as for all the people i caused to become molesters i did help them so that they could return to their normal lives everyone i am truly sorry azazel also said to me ise i think your choice of power is great your rival vali is trying to take juggernauts power to the limits to become a true tyrant the heavenly dragon even if you make the same choice as him it will only proceed like the last time when the old maou faction attacked and be devoured by it ise do not take the path of tyranny but choose the road to royalty wishing to become king is the right idea the road to royalty is that so after all if i try to imitate vali i will never catch up to him lets just go with the current flow for now akenosan seemed to suddenly recall something and clapped her handsby the way the youkai world has decided to start broadcasting the oppai dragon show hey isekun looks like you are going to be even
more famous really looks like things are getting out of control i am having such a surreal feeling xenovia nodded ise will become the hero of all the children in the world one day yes perhaps your dream to rise above the ranks of commoners will be achieved soon i thought deeply about xenovias words is that so but i dont feel like i am welcomed by the girls if this continues i will only be surrounded by kids not by a harem as i thought pessimistically sensei went ah and remembered something oh by the way the house of phoenixs daughter is going to transfer to kuou before the cultural festival other than buchou akenosan and konekochan everyone was surprised ravel really i asked and sensei replied ah yes looks like she was influenced by rias and sonas example and requested to study in japan she should be a first year the formalities are all complete the same year as koneko eh but cats and birds dont get along too well watching them together will be fun whatever konekochan seemed displeased eh konekochan hates ravel now that its mentioned i have never seen them speaking to each other as
first years please get along but then why did she suddenly transfer sensei gave me a look of despise and stared long and hard at me what what are you trying to say with that kind of expressionyes this is just my guess rias will be having a tougher time after hearing senseis words not only buchou but all the girls faces were showing complicated expressions even after coming back i cant relax asias voice was so depressed endure asia developing relations with this guy means endurance i too have come to understand this recentlyyes i have no choice but to endure now xenovia and irina were also softly speaking amongst themselves rather than endure i want to attack akenosan showed a challenging smile i rreally dont understand what are they talking about ravels not a bad girl buchou sighed and gave a wry smile ok everyone is back safe lets call it a day i will ask for the details from oniisama through grayfia later ah buchous mood seemed to have improved finally now then the school festival is coming up we have to get serious with preparations also buchous face was serious as she continued the match against
sairaorg this is supposed to be the last battle in the youth tournament we can not be careless lets prepare together yes thats right the school festival was important but the match against sairaorgsan was also crucial isekun lets spar when we recover i really felt my incompetence in kyoto and hope you will give me strength yes kiba lets have simulated battles until the match the training with kiba will start once again i really wanted to try this power on that person and see what effect it would have and let queen awaken in that state so much to do will the new power be allowed in the rating game but then buchou and i as well as everyone else will surely win i expressed my determination once again we must defeat sairaorgsan nothing short of victoryboss x boss sirzechs we will send the data we collected from the heroes faction they seem to have three high tier longinus as well as a gathering of balance breakers not only are they trying to summon great red but it looks like they have other plans these detestable terrorists they appear to be working under the banner of destroying the
devil and youkai alliance azazel disregarding the core members this is what the lower subordinates believe as justice it is due to this that the various factions in the kyoto barricade suffered heavy losses they not only possess annihilation maker but have many balance breaker users this is changing the situation much more than we imagined from the human point of view devils angels and youkai are all enemies they probably just view them as monsters the alliance of the three bible factions seems to be the spark that lit them into action devils getting along with fallen angels is already shocking but heaven working with the underworld is even more unbelievable it isnt surprising that humans will feel threatened and angered at this unnatural turn of events anyway how are the talks with the youkai extremely well they want to negotiate with the fallen angels next really looks like the proposal shemhaza has been pushing all along will finally get started also did you know that sakra has been sending the first generation sun wukong and the jade dragon all over the world this time they also helped a lot since god of the bible is dead and now
indra as top tier gods if sakra and zeus happened to get assassinated by true longinus then the balance of power between the various factions will be broken once again isnt sending the first gen sun wukong to deal with terrorists the best way however if the heroes in other words the humans are our enemies then arent we the final bosses that the warrior party defeats at the end or the hidden bosses humans will always be unpredictable and scary existences thats right by the way ise and the rest have accomplished new victories in kyoto there is no question to his promotion rightyes it is enough if things go as planned i will recommend him after the next rating game you mean the match with sairaorg sairaorg has also defeated many terrorists the only young devils possessing this level of power are bael agares gremory and sitri as to being able to contend with the upper echelons of the core leadership i fear only sairaorg and rias servants have the power to do so thus much hope is being placed upon the servants of both sides already rivalling the professional upper class devils eh yes once they begin
official games both of them will definitely win titles rapidly also there are many in the house of gremory that are optimistic about rias and they eagerly anticipate ises future performance as his future brother i am very proud haha getting proud of your brotherinlaw so soon being both maou and a brother your identity sure is complicated i am very happy isekun and rias are my hope i want to watch over their growth but then what is it azazel i wanted to ask rias what is going on with rias breasts rias breasts have exceeded its frontiers in this incident looks like they entered 2nd phase so rias has become the super switch princess ah in that case shouldnt the oppai dragon merchandise enter a new phase too your mind for business is getting sharper will ises new power be allowed in the match i think its a rather interesting ability all the other higher ups are fine with it they think it will be fun what remains is sairaorg but i fear he will probably vali lucifer and thats it my report is done valisama ah thanks le fay thank you for luring the first generation sun
wukong and the jade dragon to that dimension hows hyoudou issei i am very touched to meet the greatly anticipated chichiryuteisan is that so yes great one more thing first gensama seems to be looking for valisama and bikou we may run into them soon to completely shake the first gen off our backs will be very hard but hidden in the depths of the sacred gear hyoudou issei has begun contact with the past possessors valisama persuading others by words is not my style i will take the greater challenge of dominating the past possessors it is more interesting that way cao cao if you want to defeat us youd better do it while its still possible before i and ise completely surpass your powersbael sairaorg are you listening whats the matter seekvaira agares rumors say the sekiryuutei under rias gremory has awakened a new power isnt that great yes he finally awakened i look forward to it but then they say that this ability is powerful enough to make the rating game unfair no problem i will allow it it is also said that ajuka beelzebubsama favours him doesnt matter your opponent will also become the future brotherinlaw
of sirzechs lucifer thats perfect he is on the same level as the hero faction leader he fought the holy spear and lived of course it wouldnt do to break the agreement we had wouldnt you agree hyoudou isseiheroes the kyoto project failed but another plan is under adjustment you will see it soon cao cao is that so good siegfried according to the plan i will take one of these cao cao are you going to use it this spear is enough for me hows the eye wounded by the sekiryuutei no good it cant be used any more hoho he really got me this time what made you carry phoenix tears and not use them then lets prepare a replacement are you going to make him pay for the eye of course not im not some third rate villain this is a valuable lesson the wound on the eye is a reminder to me hyoudou issei and vali are the best heavenly dragons what joyafterword i am ishibumi who turned 30 this month my appetite seems to have lessened recently is it due to age after 9 months the 9th volume is finally released i had very many
ideas so getting them down on paper gave a very satisfying feeling like pouring my heart out as the pen flowed smoothly so increased the thickness of the book ises group finally battles the hero faction i got to write many battle scenes this time it makes me so happy one year ago i went to kyoto to collect data for reference before that i had never been to kyoto in the 3 school trips in primary junior high and high school miraculously they all went to fukushima this time i went to kyoto the food was great the scenery was beautiful the old capital is a great place as the opening of the 3rd story arc volume 7 was the norse legend story this volume is the kyoto youkai story the kyuubi is introduced as the youkai leader but she will probably only be active this once as to the leader this was actually changed a bit the original plan was to use the shutendoji as the leader but then someone said that oni is not good so it was changed they said that writing about oni in the book would have terrifying consequences in the early stages of
planning dxd one of the ideas was the kyuubi princess marries the onmyoji protagonist i was thinking whether i should write about that in the end the idea evolved into the devils of the novel but the original idea has been partially reused in this volume volume 9 can be described as the balance breaker party when discussing with miyamazero and the supervisor i was wondering is a balance breaker party possible but the two of them immediately gave their support saying that dxd can overcome inflation thanks to them in this very volume ises power also increased he begins to realize his own unique power as the sekiryuutei but different from juggernaut as the power source buchou is quite something fresh naked shining oppai entering the 2nd phase buchous oppai can glow bishop version of illegal move triaina the cannons were miyamazeros idea he was puzzling over how to draw the bishop and suddenly had a great idea and so gave him two cannons on his shoulders looks a bit likethe microwave cannons of gundam dx the rooks punch is a bit like sudden impact in big o increasing power in an instant the knight is a reference to
kamen rider kabuto where there is a two stage transformation when power is fully liberated to become queen what will ise be like though he has the approval of the two strongest sekiryuutei the rest of the senpai are still ignoring ise and wallowing in their negative emotion will ise be able to lift their curse please look forward it this time i tried to dig deeper into the church trio asia doesnt need explanation xenovia is cornering ise step by step and finally irina is also without lifting a finger the chichiryutei has gathered the 3 of strong faith into his clutches how will things develop from here also rossweisse gets to show her stuff sort of she is a different kind of oneesama compared to rias and akeno everyone please treat her with love because she has experienced a lot she becomes like that if she lets loose a bit though she is very strict her core is a very kind person valis team has the sorceress le fay and gogmagogs introduction with this the hakuryuukous team has all appeared this time is just to let everyone see them in volume 6 when vali was taking action in
the dimensional gap was the time when gogmagog was found the number of characters are increasing but as long as you are familiar with the gremory group irina ddraig azazel sirzechs and vali theres no problem because the story basically revolves around them everyone else are occasional appearances and villains lets talk about the hero faction next they are humans when i was writing dxd i thought if the devils angels and fallen angels ally who will feel threatened the most the answer is humans if you suddenly heard that devils and fallen angels have allied wouldnt that feel rather scary the path they pursue is the one taken by rpg protagonists who defeat maou and dragons but other than that cao cao and his group has other plans vali is also involved since the hero faction is rather merciless ise and his friends who got their school trip interfered are quite unfortunate but then after all that happened ise got a power up and he did enjoy kyoto very much so its all good in the endi havent decided if all 13 longinus will make their appearance the sekiryuuteis boosted gear and the hakuryuukous divine dividing are excellent sacred
gears in terms of overall offense and defense dimension lost and annihilation maker have world class power when used by certain people and are very dangerous they exceed normal standards in many areas as for true longinus it is a secret apart from the spear cao caokun sure was careless looking back volume 9 is full of furigana designing the sacred gears took a lot of time in coming up with names since i also need to consider the names of their balance breakers as mentioned in the books sacred gears have subspecies at this time i would like to thank miyamazero san and supervisor hsan your efforts are greatly appreciated thank you to all the reader support i think the first volume of the manga is about to be released we hope everyone can support the manga version some of the oppai can only be enjoyed in the manga serialization has also moved from dragon magazine over to dragon age its monthly now next story will be the match against sairaorg this volume was about the outskirts of devil society devils dealing with outside factions next story will be about the inner workings of devil society please look forward

my calls having the school festival coming up soon i was at the huge concert hall located at the old capital city of the underworld lucifaad doing a show at the center of the stage of course it was the hero show chichiryutei oppai dragon usually the actors wear the costumes and do the show but because of sirzechssamas offer today the real me happened to perform in the show i just couldnt decline maousamas offer he also said feel free to decline if it is inconvenient for you here i go dragonkick kicccccccck i acted as if i was kicking and having a fight with the enemy kaijin1 and the children reacted to it man that was embarrassing but when i saw how the children reacted the feeling of excitement went through my body the hall was full it was filled with children and their mums apparently they gathered from all over the underworld the stage had really showy devices set and every time i fought an explosion occured the devils were seriously researching a lot about the humans tokusatsu2 shows beside me buchou the switchprincess and kiba who was acting as the bad guy darknessknight fang were on
the stage when buchou who was wearing the dress of switchprincess waved her hand the group of guys that were her fans started cheering with the children uooooooo on the other hand kiba had many female fans which also included the mums shit im envious of that bastard kiba but oppaidragonthere was something inside the cheers of the children who were seeking me that i just couldnt explainlife 1 the preparations for the school festival part 1 fuuu i finished most of my role for the show and im currently taking a break behind the stage hmm after this is finished i have to resume preparing for the school festival in the humans world we are going to prepare quite a lot of things so we lack manpower so both kiba and i were doing our best for preparation everyday now its time for the oppaidragon question corner uooooooooo hellcatchaaaaaaaaan sounds like konekochans big friends are cheering for her who is the presenter of the questioncorner konekochan is ridiculously popular amongst loliloving men i hear that there are those who came here just to see her somehow we are getting famous in a different way its something i should be
happy about but i never expected chichiryuutei oppaidragon to get this popular thats how much entertainment the underworld lacked and shows how things like this must be new to them the setup sirzechssama did in order to stir up the future of the underworld for the devils could be said to have become a huge success in the underworld media they have broadcasted about lokis attack and the incident in kyoto on the news and they have made a great announcement of the gremorygroup who were involved in those incidents possibly because of that when we come to the underworld for events we get surrounded by people related to the media who started to take pictures of us for the world of devils which didnt have any battles which stand out it seems like the incidents we get involved in are new to them and apparently its good news to them since a lot of things like the existence of terrorists and alliances between various factions are confusing them oppaidragon another achievementthats how they broadcasted it to the children in the underworld the oppaidragon inside the television and the actual me are being mixed up with what we do in
other words inside the childrens mind their hero from the television is the one who is being active against loki and the guys from khaosbrigade i made a sigh and then held my head down im happy but im also having mixed feelings about it of course in the world of devils where battles are supposed to be rare why are we the only ones caught up in fierce battles our opponents were guys like legendary beings oldmaou and a god you know finally we ended up even battling against descendants of heroes in how many insanelevel battles do we get caught up in when the chances for these encounters are low peace peace is the best you know i just want to live peacefully with buchou asia and akenosan ecchi things do happen at times but i prefer having a more ecchi and naughty lifestyle lovecomedy i have a normal dream of having a lovecomedy daily life but how did i get myself in this spiral full with violenceeeeeee wwell the cheering i get from the kids does make me happy and the event today was super fun as well but i do get tired from all the fierce
battles i myself dont want to die and i dont want my comrades to be dragged into it as well if someone in our group were to die i seriously would become depressed but because we were dragged into such battles its definitely true that our group became what we are its really complicated we opened up to each other thanks to that maybe in order to make the best team we probably have to break through the worst situation together like i thought this is due to the dragons traitno the heavenlydragons trait which comes for those with power it certainly makes me worried about it maybe these incidents happened because of me my feeling about that increases day by day azazelsensei also said that too many irregular things happen i should stop thinking about it the more i worry about this the more it will get to me i should accept things which have already happened and work hard for better things thats the only option phew i should go and wash my face in the washroom then i need to refresh myself when i went to the corridor and walked for few minutesi started to hear noisy
voices noooooooooo it seemed like a child was crying very loudly when i looked from behind the wall i saw a mother with a child talking to one of the staffs i want to meet oppaidragon the child was stamping on his feet and it seemed like his mother also didnt know what to do im sorry the handshaking and autograph event has already finished the staff person says that while apologizing ah so they didnt have enough tickets to hand out for the handshake and autograph session it seems like they were handing it out before the show started the underworld adapted this by copying the events styled in the humans world but for devils who have different lifestyles and culture to humans they must feel that handing out tickets for the handshake and autography is something new is that so he said its already finished when the mother said that to her child the child had more tears flowing out and then shouted in his hand he was holding a toy of me when i am in my armour form hes holding it very importantly i couldnt help myself after seeing that nooooo i started my countdown even
though i deactivated my armour just beforei cant help it after seeing a child put on such a face theres no way i can endure it while releasing a redlight i got into a balancebreaker state once again and then i went out towards the rear exit i just had my maskpart open did something happen the mother the child and the staff turned around at my voice its oppaidragon the child showed a happy face immediately the staff then explains it to me ah hyoudousan well this mother and child couldnt make it when the tickets for the handshake and autograph were distributed after checking out the situation about this i asked the child while i got on my knees whats your name lirenkus lirenkus thanks for coming to see me umm do you have anything to write with when i asked the staff yyes i do he took out a marker pen this cap can i sign on this cap which has a design of me i pointed at the cap of the child lirenkus and he nodded his head down three times my badly written devilletters the more signatures i do the more i think that i
should get better at writing thats because there are so many kids like him who look at me with bright eyes i started to feel that i wanted to get good at both fighting and writingi signed on the cap and i put it on lirenkuss head while putting on a bright face lirekus takes off the cap and then puts it on many times repeatedly thank you very much his mother says her thanks i put my hand on lirenkuss head and then told him lirenkus men shouldnt cry you have to become strong so that you can protect a girl no matter how many times you fall and keep on standing up after saying that i stood up and left the scene with the staff the staff says it to me while putting on a confused face hyoudousan please restrain from doing things like this its impossible to deal with everyoneso if you make an exception it will be a bit hes right i also think i did something thoughtless the staff are also doing their best and they try to fulfill everyones dream but they had to hand out the tickets knowing that it wont turn out
like that if i make an exception then i would be betraying the feelings of all staffs that issomething i knew from the start even so i couldnt just leave a child crying in front of me no this is my fault im sorry i will be careful from now i apologised to the staff and i really am feeling bad about what i did the staff understood and left the scene without saying anything im very sorry but i you looked amazing to be expected from my ise buchous voice when i looked buchou was standing there she walks up to me and then started to pat my cheek you were a bit careless but still you were able to protect that childs dream buchoubuchou buchou understands me more than anyone that alone was enough to make me happy yeah this person really is the best woman out there i was being emotional to buchou who always looks at me with warm eyes and then a woman who im familiar with shows up from the far side of the corridor ara how are you rias and isseisan what are you doing here a woman with chestnutcoloured hair who looks
identical to buchou o okaasama and millicas you two came maybe buchou didnt expect this person to come so she made a flustered voice and was shocked yes this person who is identical to buchou is none other than buchous mother riasneesama iseniisama i really enjoyed the show next to her is a boy with crimsonhair millicassama he looks energetic and intelligent like always and he called me niisamai am very honoured buchous mother says it while smiling yes i wanted to take a look at an event organised by our gremory group just once upclose millicas also said he wanted to have a look as well isesan it was really flashy wasnt it i think it was a good show oh so they watched the show huh even though im embarrassed i also feel happy house of gremory are the ones in control of managing the oppaidragon franchise ththank you very much i said my thanks i try not to be rude to buchous mother but more than that it feels like i cant oppose her though she looks like a bishoujo3 from the outside buchous mother walks towards us while making noise with her heels the tokusatsu show
that is based on isesan will become an important business that will support the finances of gremory and it also has becomesomething important to the children in the underworld even from now on as a member of the gremory it will be a great help if you work hard for all of the underworld our household and my daughter of course buchous okaasama i will work hard while having a spirit of funkotsusaishin4 funkotsusaishin thats a japanese phrase if im correct a very good reply to be expected from a man belonging to our house of gremory but buchous mother strokes my chin with her finger while putting on gentle eyes that alone makes my heart beat because it makes me feel the seductiveness of an adult woman calling me buchous okaasama is unacceptable do not call me buchous okaasama you have to call me either okaasama or hahaue that again huh what are buchous family asking me to do bubut it seems a bit rude you know there is nothing rude about it instead it will be an embarrassment to the whole house of gremory if you still call me that after you two go to the high society
parties buchous mother expression takes a complete change and now she has a strict expression rias arent you lacking in your teaching buchous mother glares at her and buchou then says it my apologies okaasama but for you to say but there you will be taking in the man who will accompany you into our house so why arent you doing it more properly also have you decided on the sequential order at least asiasan and akenosan are in it correct asia akenosan whats going on if the man is wishing for that then its your role as the heir to manage it if its going to increase even more you will have to do it properly from now on it was i who took control of it in the case with your father its a usualthing in the world for a woman to be attracted by men who are both charming and strong sirzechs only has grayfia because he is a maou but he isnt aiming to become maou correct then there isnt any problemor you still havent made a decision on it yet oh my i thought you inherited the pushy attitude from me but for you to
become weak at the last and crucial moment once you form a relationship you can also gain the authority of other women around him rias can you not even make progress in your relationship with him without grayfia and i getting involved it seems like buchou is embarrassed at her mothers words aaah just like grayfiasan buchous mother also started to talk like a machine gun because she feels unsatisfied it seems like both of them have quite a lot of dissatisfaction towards buchou it sounds like they are talking about their whole family iim also included in their topicright hhmm i dont get it isesan you are also at fault first of all you need to know how to address the people of the house of gremory forget about me for now but whats important is about rias for you to continue calling her buchou thats the most important and crucial part buchous mother said it while pointing her finger at my nose do you like rias yyes of course i admire her and shes also someone important to me even with the cost of my life i will protect her until the end of my life i told
her my feelings honestly its an obvious thing to do next to me buchou put on a red face eeeh i said something so obvious and she turned like that buchous mother nods her head and then continues very well i certainly have witnessed your beautiful masterservant relationship then you should take another step forward during private times what is rias to you please rethink about that again to me what is buchou huhwell thats obvious the woman i fell for the person i love thats why i want to protect her no more than that i want to get along with her even more but for me right now that is something which is a very terrifying thing to do would you die for me that woman whom appears inside my head i shook my head to get rid of that thought buchous mother leaves from here millicassama waves his hand at me and i wave my hand back at him buchou who is next to me and who has a red face makes a cough nnow once we get back we have to resume preparing for the school festival okay yes anyway i need to finish things which
are in front of my eyes the school festival is coming up very soon oh there was another important thing i need to take care of part 2 next day i was standing in front of the schools firstyear classroom its konekochans and gaspers classroom today the ojousama of the house of phoenix ravel transferred here ravel is more of an ojousama than buchou it will be her first time attending a school for ordinary people will she be able to cope with the lifestyle within this school i was worried about that i came here during a break as i was worried about her but isnt that the beastsenpai from the second year oh no i heard a rumour that you will get hypnotised just by being looked at by him and he does whatever he likes with youand he used that on all of the school idols in our school to make them into his toys im scared the gaze the first year girls are giving me is horrible no this isnt anything new i shouldnt worry about it these things pouring from my eyes arent my tears this is just sweat from my heart ara ise also
came to see how shes doing buchous voice when i turned around buchou was also there bbuchou too yes i was a bit worried when i checked inside the classroom with buchou konekochan and gasperwho was standing in a place where he doesnt stand out were talking in the corner of the room and ravel is oh i found a drilltype rolled hair there she is heh the school uniform suits her phoenixsan do you have the textbooks phoenix sure is a rare surname it sounds cool im glad that this class was the one to have another foreign transfer student after gyakun just like that she was surrounded by the girls i see since she just transferred it cant be helped if she is approached by her classmates if a bishoujo from a foreign country transferred then for today she would be treated as an idol ohohohoho ask me any question you want i will answer them for all of you since its ravel who has a highhanded attitude i thought she would talk with an oppressive manner but she seems to be troubled about how to respond to them and is having a hard time she seems to
be so troubled that she can only say uumm and aaah as her replies her gaze wanders around so she seems like she doesnt know where to lookthen her gaze catches me and buchou because buchou has come first year girls who are buchous fans started to make a racket so she must have become curious she then immediately got up from her seat by saying excuse me and approaches us ravel takes buchous and my hand and tries to take us somewhere she let go of our hands after we took a turn in the corridor wwhats wrong ravel when i ask her with apprehension she makes her face red as if she is embarrassed iits my first time transferring to a school so i ddont know how to interact with everyone iim a devil so i cant find a topic to discuss with everyone who are humans i see she is a devil on top of that she is a highclass devil ojousama and since she transferred to a school in the human world which is attended by ordinary people then it must be hard for her to find a topic she can talk about if i think
about it this would be natural but unlike her highhanded attitude her reaction is cute its not like you dont want to talk to them right buchou asks her oof course eeven i am maturing i feel that getting to know people who arent nobles and learning from the commoners lifestyle is also important oh shes splendid shes different from her brother raiser the socalled raiser got depressed after losing against me but after that we somehow made him stand up again after ravel came to consult with us thanks to that his dragonphobia was cured and he was able to return to his ordinary lifestyle i also heard that his comeback to the rating game will be soon that guy isnt a heinous person just like me he is a sukebe personoh i need to get back about ravel hmm so the thing is that she doesnt know how to talk and how to interact with them but i think that once she talks to them even once she would be able to understand how i pondered for a while and then pounded my hand onto my other hands palm yeah there is only one way hold on a
sec konekochan can it happened when i was about to go back to konekochans and ravels classroom did you call me konekochan was standing near me oh and gasper as well so they followed us i then ask konekochan konekochan i have a favour what is it ravels talking pal actually more like i want you to support her for her school lifestyle you two are in the same year and also in the same class right please konekochan is one of the school idols and i hear that she is getting along with her classmates if she was to start a discussion using konekochan then i think it will be easier for ravel to open up to her classmates but konekochan seems a bit displeased she twitched her eyebrows and her mouth has a shape of a triangle she looks cute but shes acting weird did i say something wrong after thinking for a bit if senpai says that then i dont mind she answers me like that to be expected from konekochan so its like that ravel konekochan will be hetare yakitorihime5 talking over me konekochan says that a moment of silence veins appears on ravels forehead she
then says it with a trembling voice rright now what did you just call me hetare6 konekochan answers without any pause wwhat is going on both of them started arguing while leaving me who still hasnt gotten a hold of this situation behind yyyou to talk to the daughter from the house of phoenix in such a manner since you talk in such manners dont you become a hetare at crucial times i thought you came to the human world with a strong resolve for you to trouble isesenpai clueless yakitorihime snap i heard something snap from ravel ravel who is emitting a creepy aura her rolledhair is starting to tweak konekochan also doesnt back down and is glaring back with a cute face mmmmmmmm ii didnt do such a thing to trouble isesama tthis nekomatayakitori iit seems like a cat and a fire bird are glaring fiercely behind both of them auuuuuuuuiim scared gasper got frightened by the two girls so he hid behind my back im also scared hehey both of you why are you two suddenly glaring at each other get along you two are in the same class after all i stood between both of them
and tried to stop them but i was frightened because of the battle between a cat and a bird but i have to stop them both of them are my precious juniors now now calm down konekochan ravel im not being troubled so you two can talk to me as much as you want whose side are you on they asked me unanimously eeven if you say that you sure are kind ise buchou slips that from her mouth next to me ah then one of the firstyear girls comes and passes us and dropped a load of sheets on the ground ah you dropped them because you were looking elsewhere i tried to pick it up but ravel helped her quicker than me and started picking up the sheets are you okay if i remember you are from the same class as me your name is i still havent asked you yet tthank you very much so you recognise me phoenixsan my name is murota ravel is fine murotasan oh you are being kind ravel the reason why she naturally helped out is proof that she is a kindhearted girl more than that remembering the faceof your classmate as
soon as you transferred made you gain extra points ravel even the other girl is emotionally moved then konekochan and gasper helped her out konekochan and ravels eyes met while picking up the sheets hmph my two juniors look away from each other hahaha this is totally unheard of this is something i heard afterwards but it seems like ravel opened up to her classmates because she helped out in picking up the sheets i also heard that konekochan is looking after her i feel that ravels school life started with a good start part 3 now then we will start the preparations yeah after school buchou orders us and we reply back to her energetically we the occult research club began preparing for the school festival after ravels introduction of joining the club the thing that the occult research club will be presenting is occult mansion it was decided that we will be using the whole oldschool building and present lots of entertainment there will be an obakeyashiki7 a fortunetelling room a caf and report revelation on occult research so like that it was decided to use all the ideas our club members suggested the occult research club was
given charge of the whole oldschool building so it was decided that we wont hold back and use it to the fullest there are rooms which arent used and rooms which were turned into storage rooms using them we can do a ghosthouse a fortunetelling and a caf just like that we are in the middle of customising the oldschool building for the school festival we can do the changes quickly if we usedemonicpowers but buchou said she wants to make it with our hands as much as possible all of us agreed with her opinion so we got ready to do the work this is the base of the gremory group but it is also a part of the school and we are students if we have to use it for school circumstances we want to do this as normal students the girls are mainly making costumes and changing the interiors of rooms they are making costumes for the caf and the ghosthouse while others customise unused classrooms for personal use for ravel who just joined the club this is her first time participating so this will be new to her she is quite shocked although she is working
very hard to help out me and kiba are doing building procedures as we are the only manpower we cut and put together wood and such by using a hammer and a saw well the girls are also devils so they will have more strength than humans and would be able to do these tasks as well but since we are doing this as students we try to follow these procedures as much as we can so we the guys are sweating a lot while hammering and cutting the wood isekun hold over there okay just like that kiba and i are working with wood azazelsensei and rossweissesan are at the teachers meeting which takes place after school it seems the minor parts of the school festival havent been decided yet though i think they are mostly discussing about important points for the student guardians my parents will also be attending the festival well they are coming to see asia though it was like that for the sports festival so i wonder if buchous parents will be coming as well we wont be able to cope with sirzechssama and leviathansama at the same time looks like we need to leave
them to the student council while we are cutting the wood with the saw kiba speaks by the way isekun do you know diehauser belialhe brings up a name of someone that name certainly sounds familiar there were times when buchou and akenosan were talking about that person and buchou has been researching about him by watching videos of him just his name hes the champion right of the rating game that is kiba nods at my answer yeah hes ranked first in the official rating game the current champion the diehauser belial he is the head of house of belial and the first monster since the house of belial was formed he is the real king of the game who has been standing at the top for a very long time the person who is called emperor belial emperor belial emperor huh thats an amazing title for someone who isnt a maou kiba speaks while continuing his work rankings 20 and below are said to have a power on a totally different level and if you are in top10 you would even be called a hero among them ranks 5 and below are said to be unmovable they have
been standing in the top positions where they havent moved their ranks for a long time especially the 3rd ranked bedeze abaddon the 2nd ranked roygun belphegor and the 1st ranked diehauser belial they are ultimateclass devils among ultimateclass devils who have the power equal to the current maou though all three of them are said to not take any actions unless a large scale war were to happen they have been researched due to the games traits and they are spoken well of by others they are called the results born due to many matches the results made from the game itself so it means they are insanely strong devils wait they have the power equal to the currentmaou are guys like them allowed to participate in the game well actually it wont be weird oldman tannin is also an ultimateclass devil and i heard that he participated in the game before and that he has been within the top10 he hasnt retired but i heard that right now he wants to focus on training young dragons instead of the rating game abaddon and belphegor are household names ive never heard beforei said my doubt i dont have memories
of the names of the 2nd or 3rd ranker they are not names of the 72pillars that i have memorised kiba answers me that is true they are extrademon after all their households dont want to get involved with the current government but among the households they are special cases it seems like they basically cut ties with their household and are participating in the game hmm so there are devils that participate in the game while having such complex problems they want to participate in a game so much that they would even leave their house that means rating game has that much attraction to it its said that you can fulfill any desire that you have such as gaining authority fortune women status or battling by participating in a game and winning it i feel great attraction to it as well this is the dream that the current government gave to the devils ambition but you know if sirzechssama and other maou could participate in the game then the rankings would be different that cant be helped due to the game rules maou cant participate if its maous servants then they would be able to participate but the
thing is that they arent interested it seems like the dream of yondaimaous servants are to continue living as the servants of their maou the game can be similar to but also different from actual battle its a game created to make up for the lack of actual battles for devils but the game itself has many special rules so i think the tactics and strategies used are different between the two thats why i feel that it wouldnt be rare for those who are strong in actual battles to not have their rating in the game improve its quite rare for kiba to share his thoughts like this is it proof that he is opening up to me but if it is just like what kiba said then in the game the possibility for the current champions team to be stronger than the maous team is high it is also a game which is like a simulation because there is no war right now but it means that we should approach the game differently than how we take part in real battles rightkiba nods his head at my words yeah we might have plenty of real battle experience but
we havent gotten used to the special rules of the game at all the sitrimatch obviously proved that point if we participate in a game we could encounter those rules that means it is necessary for us to have a different mindset than when we approach real battles kiba continues to say it while hitting the nail with the hammer either way if both you and buchou are aiming to become champion of the game in the future diehauser belial is a big wall whom you cant avoid facing if you are planning to rise up in the world of devils then it might be good for you to think of the current rankers as existences that you will have to defeat well i buchous knight will have to get involved in the world of the rating game as well buchous participation in the official game will be after she graduates from university which means that it will be after four or five more years it seems like its very distant but also seems like its very soon at that time how much can we raise above will we be able to fight the emperor oh i need to focus
on what is in front of me first i shook my head and then lifted up the saw high for now its the match against sairaorgsan kiba also nodded hard me and kiba are training for that day the other members are training as well so we cant fall behind baelsgroup to some extent our information is known to them they would have recognised our abilities through the youthdevils match video the information which they probably dont know is isekuns new technique and xenovias exdurandal the recorded video should be open to the public so it would be natural for our opponents to know our abilities so my and kibas balancebreaker should be thoroughly researched they should also be trying to get the best new information that they can right of course they would if they say bring it on anything you want without researching before the game will make the level of their king andgroups doubtful for that reason we are also investigating their information as well we also used the video of the yankeedevil the match with glasyalabolas as reference and are researching the bael group except now they wont be at the same level as back then
just like us they are ones who do training which is rare among devils we should at least think that the enemy will come at us with powers which far surpass the time they fought yankee but isekuns power up should be within their field of vision it also seemed like he sensed something from you in the sparring the other day so they are being cautious about you the problem is when you will use that technique due to the characteristics of the technique it will be the most effective to attack with it while they still havent seen it before thats right it seemed like sairaorgsan understood something from a sparring match against me which took place at the gremoryhouse before i went on the school trip it might be obvious for him to assume that i awoke the new power during the school trip and also the inside details of my new ability as well yeah each of the forms has a strong trait so it doesnt seem like i can use them against sairaorgsan more than twice illegal move triainawhich i shortened and called triaina has both its strong points and weak points due to being
a special version of each chess piece welsh sonicboost knight gains godspeed but because it purges the armour the defence goes down drastically i can cover its weak defence by form changing into welsh draconic rook but that will increase my stamina consumption repeating it will be hard welsh blaster bishop can shoot out an enormous amount of demonicpowers but it takes quite some time to charge and to begin with there will be no point if the attack doesnt hit welsh dragonic rook increases the offence and defence drastically but possibly because the armour gets thicker it loses speedso like that each of them is powerful but the weakness of each form is obvious the more the strong point is strengthened the more the weak point will become even more obvious i could cover my weaknesses with my combo but as a result my stamina consumption will increase if you do the combo you can cover the weakness of each promotion form but isekuns stamina will be used quite a lot but you wont be able to survive if you dont use the combo when you have to so it would be better for you to use it but
fighting for a long duration will have high risks yeah the technique itself is more for shortduration battles so i should save it as much as i can thats why a oneshot contest would be preferable the reason why i was able to have an advantage in the battle against cao cao back in kyoto was because the enemy had never seen that technique before if i was to show even a single promotion then the chance for the opponent to predict a new ability for other chess pieces are high ah if thats a specialised form of knight then are there specialised forms of other forms too they would predict it like that well if i take them down with a combo at once then i would be able to give huge damage to that opponent but the biggest problem will be the chargetime for the triana version of bishop eitherway i need to save this technique somehow well if i was put in a situation where i have to use it then it cant be helped like i thought i would have to take them down with a combo but i would have to adjust the timing when
i will use the promotion and simulate them repeatedly the sequential order is also important for the combo i was able to do it in kyoto but using the triainatype bishop first will be bad its full of openings since i would have to charge it maybe i should blast it from a distance and then narrow my distance with the opponent using trianatype knight and then take down the opponent using trianatype rook when im in front of them hmm that would be the same as back in kyoto i sure have no variety in techniquesi will also tag along with each of your training like always just like isekun i also want to try out the idea of a new technique i have as well oh you sure said something which makes me anxious about new technique seriously it sure makes me anxious do you have any idea on it yeah pretty much by the way is ddraig alright lately i havent seen him talking to you much having kiba say that i made the gauntlet appear immediately and talked to ddraig who has been silent for a long time ddraig you still dont feel good to answer
me who questioned him ddraig speaks so even kiba can hear his voice was that of an unenergetic person yeah lately there are things i think a lot about haaa the sekiryuuteidono made a deep sigh it seems like ddraig feels down ever since we got back from kyoto apparently he started to think a lot about my continuously horrible way of powering up he has been crying the whole time after all lots of people around me say that its quite a serious thing for a heavenlydragon to cry im sorry for being a sukebe8 partner oh secret talks between guys sekiryuutei sure doesnt question the gender of his prey the one who appeared saying such joke was azazelsensei sensei please give me a break wait did the staff meeting for the school festival finish i got out by using the excuse that i dont feel well man maybe its because there are foreign students but there sure are many precaution rules they are saying this and that well i left it to rossweisse and fled cruel like always this teacher sure is rough and has a lack of sincerity at these kinds of things though rossweissesan seems like
a person whoblends in with meetings and as such no matter what she says so it might be alright sensei then talks to my gauntlet oh yeah ddraig like you asked i found a reliable counsellor i see im sorry about this i made a really shocked voice hearing this conversation wawawait a sec what do you mean a counsellor a counsellor is something im not aware of happening sensei says it while scratching his cheek well ddraig sent a message privately to me through fafnirs jewel apparently he is crying without realising it quite often lately it seems like the number of times he sighs has increased and that he feels his heart is being ripped apart every time he hears the word oppai tits and breasts when i heard that i became speechless what on earth i ask ddraig once again wha seriously ddraig says it after making a deep sigh yeah im sorry partner i really cant get motivated but there wont be a problem with pulling up your power haa something which is beyond what i imagined is happening to ddraig mainly his mentality that is sso it isnt because i went deep within the sacred
gear or because i thought of a new technique i then brought up possible reasons for his bad condition but sensei shook his head and reject my reasons no what i think is that because you have brought miracles using oppai that made him get shocked and he started to have stress even if he is a being whos soul is residing in a sacred gear you do know that he is one of the only two heavenlydragon right if an embodiment of power andpride powers up using tits then it wont be weird for his heart to fall into sickness because of the shock i dropped down on my knees hhow can this be because of my powerup using oppai it wounded ddraigs heart more than necessary if i think about it this is true ddraig always cried every time i act due to breast related things ii never thought he would have this much stress inside him well i will tell you the contact number of the counsellor afterwards i sure went through a lot to find a dragonspecific counsellor anyway i will be going to the oldschool building then waving his hand sensei leaves i then stroke
the gauntlet while being in shock at my partners condition im sorry ddraig for you who always helped me to get into such state because of meand the reason for this is because of my sukebepower i was finding a power different to juggernautdrive which wont make me over do it but the result i got was for ddraig to become even more pitiful no your powerup isnt that bad partner its a good powerupits just that my spirit was weaker than i thoughtim sorry dont say that you were only just more fragile than we thought the mentalcare for my dragon is also something that should have been within my mustdo range dont apologise im the one at fault here i only thought about myself and i didnt even think a bit about you i only asked for your help when i needed to and i cant do anything for you at times like this so im a failure as your partner partner it seems like ddraig is emotionally touched and he had a teary voice i then said it while embracing my left armi will definitely take care of you even though from now it might still be
tits but i will take importance of you even more from now yeah my heart will get torn even more from now so i leave it to your care until my last moment uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ddraiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig im sorry while having such an emotional scene kiba made a bitter smile because he didnt know what to do then ise so you were still working buchou appears whats wrong it seems like this procedure will take a bit more time more like we were wasting time talking so im sorry i apologise sincerely to her but buchou waves her hand saying thats not it so she didnt come here to check on us i was in doubt and buchou says to me well sairaorgs butler is saying that there is a personal favour he wants to ask me and you ise that was something i didnt anticipate part 4 the next day buchou and i came within the sitris territory in the underworld with only the two of us a gorgeous limousine is passing through a forest path which is rich with nature me and buchou are sitting in the back seat of the limousine im holding onto a flower its something buchou
brought and she handed it over to me the case this time is from okaasamas side buchou said that inside the carapparently there is a serious discussion sairaorgs butler would want to talk to us about and he sent this message to the house of gremory where buchous mother accepted buchous mother is from house of bael after all possibly because of those ties she must have accepted the butlersans wish putting aside the reason why he called us over this is my first time entering sitris territory but it sure is rich with nature yes out of few territories belonging to highclass devils sitris territory has the most nature reserve among them there are many places with beautiful scenery here next time lets come here with everyone hmm so this territory is blessed with great nature certainly the mountains we have passed by are surrounded with trees with different colours and i can only say the word amazing i look outside through the car window and buchou continues and also it is one of the territories which have advanced medical facilitys as well medical huh yes the place we are heading to now is one of the famous hospitals
in the underworld hohospital you say so we are heading to a hospital i never expected to hear that hospital sairaorgsansdoes it have something to do with buchous relative ssomeone is in the hospital then there is no way that sairaorgsan is hospitalised right since its before the game then it must be something in the line of him injuring his body due to hard training or something i became speechless because we entered a conversation which i cant pursue to ask further the limousine comes out to an open place a spacious site which had people working on it there are many buildings lined up and i saw a huge building on the other side so thats the hospitalprogressing ahead for about 10 minutes in the limousine then the limousine stops at the entrance of the huge buildings drop zone and we got out of the car i have been waiting for you the one who welcomes us is a middleage man who is wearing butler clothing he gave us a very formal bow he has an atmosphere where it seems like he can manage any task perfectly yes lead the way buchou just says that and the middleage
man starts to lead us after saying please this way me and buchou follow after him we advance through the spacious hospital and then entered the elevator there buchou speaks quietly ise you know that my mother is from the house of bael right yyes thats why that makes you and sairaorgsan cousins right yes thats right my mother is the older sister of sairaorgs otousama9 who is the head of the house of bael but they are born from different mothers sairaorgs otousama is the son of the mainwife and my mother is the daughter of the secondmistress older sister from a different mother huh i see so the current head of house of bael and buchous mother are siblings but it seems complicated since one of them is the son of the main wife and the other one is the daughter of the second mistress and obasama10saiarorgs okaasama is from the former 72pillars and is from one of the highclass devils clan the house of vapula its a great noble household which governs the lions vapula you say lion lion huh it certainly seems like sairaorgsans lineage while we were having that conversation the elevator stops when we
passed through a door we entered a floor with rooms and we advance ahead for a few minutes having the butlersan lead us we arrived in front of a certain room this is the room riassamabuchou and butler enter i also follow after them and there was a beautiful woman sleeping on the bed how do you do obasama buchou gazes at the sleeping woman with eyes filled with sorrow wait obasama judging from how the conversation went is this person perhaps the butler then says it while receiving the flower from me this person here is misura baelsama she is sairaorgsamas mother just like i thought she is sairaorgsans mother shes sleeping while having the help of something that seems like a medical ventilator the machine which is next to the bed is something ive never seen before but is it like a device which maintains her life this one has a shape a bit different from the ones in the human world so i dont know the details of it if she is in a hospital that means there is something wrong with her the butlersan while carrying the flowerwas shedding tears from his eyes today the reason
why i called both of you here is none other than this riassama sekiryuuteidono can you pleasehelp us to awaken this person misurasama from her sleep having the butlersan cry all of a sudden i became confused buchou then starts to tell me the story i will tell you a bit so even you can understand ise what she was about to tell me is a shocking fate of a particular mother and son sairaorgsan was born of his father who is the head of the house of bael and his mother who came from the noble house of vapula it seems like people around them became overjoyed because the next heir was bornbut sairaorgsan was faced with a shocking truth immediately he has barely any demonicpowers and he didnt carry the special trait of bael the power of destruction each generation of the head was blessed with demonicpowers and it was absolute for them to have the power of destruction but sairaorgsan was born without it sairaorgsans father who was in despair directed his anger to his wife where did you leave our clans power of destruction and how did you give birth to such a defect defect just
because he was born without demonicpower and the power of destruction sairaorgsan was abandoned by his father his mother who gave birth to him also was despised as well she was called a shame of the house of bael who gave birth to a defect it was a very horrible incident except for me and those from the house of vapula most of the people from the house of bael discriminated against and scorned sairaorgsama and misurasama buchou also says it while having a bit of tears in her eyes the house of gremory back then also heard that rumour so my mother tried to take in obasama and sairaorg into the gremory territory but the bael were strongly against it they said you are not even in the lineage of the mainbranch and you were sent to get married elsewhere so dont get involved into the problems of the mainbranch house of bael the gremory had sirzechssama who strongly carried the power of destruction who became active in the underworld so it seemed like the house of bael didnt find that amusing thats natural the son of the mainbranch didnt carry the special trait and instead had been passed
to the child of the one who was sent away for the house of bael there isnt any worse irony than this house of bael which is the greatking would reign in the top in terms of household rank if you dont include the currentmaou who does not belongto the heritage so it will be quite hard for a different household to make an argument against them and also they have stronger pride than anyone else such that they get cautious of how people around them would look at their clan to them obasama and sairaorg were just a burden after that the house of vapula sought for the return of sairaorgsan and his mother but the reply the house of bael gave them was a cruel one only sairaorgsama can not be handed over thats what the current head said that he cant allow the shame of his clan to be revealed to the world so misurasama wouldnt be able to agree to such a deal thats because the young sairaorgsama would have been imprisoned and destined to live alone while being discriminated without having misurasamas protection the butlersan continues misurasama declined the help from her home and she
decided to live in the remote region of bael territory with sairaorgsama and a group of her followers including myself if its in the remote region of baels territory then they would be under the place of house of baels surveillance and more than that they wouldnt have to expose sairaorgsan to the outside world the house of bael allowed the mother and son to live in the outskirt area of baels territory while having basically no support from the house sairaorgsan started to live in the countryside with his mother for misurasama who lived a lifestyle of a highclass person living in the countryside without support should have been difficult for her even so she was able to raise sairaorgsama into a splendid person she raised sairaorgsama very strictly and at times very kindly for a devil who barely has any demonicpower they wouldnt get treated well by others no matter where they go even when he moved to the countryside sairaorgsan became the target of discrimination because he has less demonicpower than the lowclass and mediumclass devils his age he was bullied by those devils even so misurasama told sairaorgsama very stronglyeven if you dont have demonicpower you
still have your fine body if you think you are lacking something cover the thing you are lacking with something else it can be brute strength it can be intelligence it can be speed so make up for it no matter what other people say you are the son of the house of bael even if you dont have demonicpower even if you dont have the power of destruction you will definitely win one day if you dont give up thats a phrase i heard from sairaorg before he said that its an important phrase that his mother taught him buchou says that you will definitely win one day if you dont give up huh even for me this phrase stimulates my heart very deeply the butlersan then says it behind him she was always apologizing she was saying sorry that she gave birth to him without bestowing him the power of destruction misurasama cried and apologised again and again next to sairaorgsama who was sleeping sairaorgsama might have realised that as well then one day he suddenly stopped crying then he started to stand up to any matter head on sairaorgsan stood up against those who made a fool
out of him he faced forward at what he lacks in and he stood up every time he was beaten down then sairaorgsan started to set forward his dream he said i want to create an underworld where any devils can make their dream come true if they have the potential no matter what their backgrounds are the devils world depends on the strength they hold but the truth is that there is a difference between those who are from nobility background and those who arent even if someone has the power but their background is from a lowclass then there arent many among them who can have a fulfilled life sonakaichou also had a similar ambition for that regardsi amone of those who are blessed my rank is a lowclass devil but im a gremorys servant and buchou who is my master is kind even so for a highclass devil who has an oldtradition of their house their discrimination towards lowclass devils and midclass devil still remains for the house of bael who reigns at the top of every household the discrimination sairaorgsan received would be crueler than i can imagine at the age where sairaorgsan started to be
able to take on midclass devils sairaorgsans mother had an unusual phenomenon occur in her body it is one of the diseases which devils develop the number of cases that happens are low but when you develop that disease you fall into a deep sleep and wont be able to wake up then your body gradually starts to become weak and you will meet death thats why you have to maintain their life artificially like this in the hospital buchou says it with sad and narrow eyes so sairaorgsans mother fell into that disease huh they searched for many ways to cure it but they didnt find any even so sairaorgsan still walked ahead after that sairaorgsama who trained his body returned to the house of bael in perfect condition and he took down his brother who is the child born between his father and his new wife with his power and attained the seat to become the next heir his younger brother must have had the power of destruction he defeated his younger brother and attained the current position i cant even imagine how complicated that must have been ah but i have a question if thats the case
sairaorgsan defeated his younger brother and returned to house of bael right then why is sairaorgsans mother here does it mean that the medical facility here is better than the one in baels territory i ask such question that is also the case but its also because there would be those after obasamas life if shes in the bael territorybuchou gives me an answer like that targeted wwhy so violent not just sairaorgs brother who had his seat to become the next heir stolen from him there are many of those who shun sairaorg because he became the next heir without having the power of destruction and obasama who is ill will become an easy target for them thats why sairaorg relied on sonas ties and moved obasama to the sitris territory i see so the quarrel of the position of the one to become the next heir is still ongoing huh the house of the greatking sure is scary is it that the house of gremory is too peaceful buchous house is very easy to settle in so i feel terrified at the dark side of the world of the devils butlersan says it while wiping his tears with
a handkerchief i asked for both of you to come for none other than one reason will you please help me in curing misurasama from her disease i hear that the sekiryuuteidono has a technique where he can listen to the voice deep inside the womans heart i heard that the nyuupower11 which is different from demonicpower can bring miracles so please i would like you to try to see if you can hear the voice of misurasama who is in a deep sleep i already have an affirmation from the doctor in charge he said it would be okay if its a demonicpower which doesnt cause any harm a nyuupower so the name azazelsensei made up by himself is going around now but having him say that sso hes telling me to use bilingual here and to use it on sairaorgsans mother shes a sick person you know is it really okay my technique was originally an erotechnique you know ccertainly my bilingual is a technique which expands a mysterious space inside me and the womans oppai speaks about what they are thinking more than i ask them in a sense you can say it is harmful but its
certain that it isnt a technique which affects the life of the target but the butlersan sure does ask a daring favour wwell in kyoto i was able speak through my opponents heart with the help of firstgeneration sun wukong so hes asking me to do it on sairaorgsans mother who is continuing to sleep because of her illnesswill my technique work on sick people we were having a serious discussion and now it turned into the opposite immediately more like lately its been in my mind that everyone is thinking too seriously about my technique now finally i have been asked to cure an illness buchou says it while having a red cheek i ddont know whether it will work but if we have the permission from the doctor in charge then we should try it ises technique has brought miracles many times so there might be a chance please use the technique on obasama ise having buchou say that much theres no reason to decline the butlersan also is begging while bowing down very low and saying please i beg you yyeah okay then then lets try this i understand i dont know how much i can do
but lets try it i made the gauntlet appear immediately and charged my power until i can activate bilingual boost i stopped the ability of multiplying of my boosted gear after charging for quite a lot of power and then moved onto activating my ability bilingual having me in the centre a mysterious space expands the same time i activated my technique i spoke towards sairaorgsans mother sairaorgsans mother please answer me so only i can hear it aare you doing well i asked her such a random thing but sairaorgsans mothers oppai didnt tell me anything like i thought it didnt work or it just failed hhmmmno if it turned out like this then i will try until the last minute this time i will ask her while in my armour form i put on my armour with the balancebreaker which had gotten an even more shorter countdown time due to the incident in kyoto im very sorry for going into balancebreaker form inside the hospital please forgive me since this is all for sairaorgsans mother while having buchou and butlersan look at me i send my power of sekiryuutei to my brain and increase my demonicpower boostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboostboost this
time sairaorgsans mothers oppai please speak to me sairaorgsans mother gets enveloped by the redaura of sekiryuutei i increased the power output and ask her again but like i expected sairaorgsans mothers breasts didnt speak at all the technique should have been put on her completely though maybe the breasts wont speak to me if they are unconscious due to illness what are you doing all of you a sudden new voice when me and buchou turned around there was a man with shortblack hair with purpleeyes and a good body buildwait its sairaorgsan i see im sorry about that sairaorgsan who understood what was going on right now made a small smile and thanked me and buchou it would be weird to talk in the patients room so we moved to the resting area i also returned to my usual state i cant be wearing armour inside the hospital after all but for me to be thanked by a person for using a titstechnique i sure cant describe how im feeling right nowim sorry i told ise about you even though its right before a game and also we couldnt be of any use today buchou apologises she probably
thinks she put unnecessary feelings inside me she probably thinks that it will be hard for me to fight in the game after learning sairaorgsans past i dont mind its good enough that you two came my mother would also be happy so it isnt uncommon for these sort of things to happen among the 72pillars the power to take hold of the next heir that is it just happened to occur in the house of greatking this time sairaorgsan says it as if his past isnt something that is shocking i thought his past was very shocking but i started to think this person is even more amazing because he overcame it even an idiot like me can understand that what he went through cant be described merely like that i have received great kindness from house of sitri and house of gremory i cant express how much gratitude i have towards you all its okay we can at least do that just a normal conversation between cousins maybe the reason why they can have a normal conversation like that is because sairaorgsan attained his seat to become the heir thats what i thought sairaorgsans expression then changed immediately
and he put on a serious face but the game is different the one to win in the next rating game would be my team so discard any unnecessary feelings you have what i want isnt sympathy or holding back but the serious gremory group he sure says that very directly sairaorgsan then looks down at his fist i only had thisown body thats why i will lose everything if i lose all the things i piled up until now will collapse for me who didnt inherit the powerof destruction of our clan the only path i had was to continue winning thats why i have to win with thisfist then he gazes at me and buchou filled with fighting spirit thats why i can only win with my fist it might look uncool but this is my awkward way of fighting you guys i swallow my saliva and then said it to sairaorgsan directly i wont hold back no matter what kind of things you experienced in the past it doesnt have anything to do with the game and i never thought that i could win against you by being sympathetic towards you or holding back in the first
place thats why i will fight you with my full power the things that sairaorgsan went through have nothing to do with the game among the members of gremory group who will be fighting there are those who had painful pasts and even among his group there should be those who have different reasons to be fighting so what is important for my future is my aim my target and to walk forward for my dreams my dream is to become a highclass devil i want to become the ultimate pawn for that i think i have to defeat you no that must be it thats why i will fight you sairaorgsan for my own ambitions hearing my words sairaorgsan smiles with satisfaction thats it yeah thats enough like i thought it seems like you gained something at kyoto i can see strength and confidence from your eyes crap when i stand in front of this person my tension naturally gets higher by itself and it feels like unnecessary things are coming out of my body it will be bad if he senses my power before the game he is one of the few men who acknowledge me so my
aura increases by itself to live up to his expectations rias hyoudou issei i will fight in the game for my dreams and my ambitions yes i wont lose buchou also answered boldly towards sairaorgsanafter that we bid our farewell to sairaorgsans butler and me and buchou went on our way to go home i felt very bad that i couldnt be of any use when they called us over wwell if my titstechniques would work on her then there will be no point of having a doctor inside the limousine while heading home i was deep in thoughts while looking at the forest from the window i cant lose thats because ihavent survived till the end in any of the games in the match against phoenix i lost miserably and in the match against sitri i lost against saji i have won in normal battles many times even so ifeel disappointed my dream is to become the ultimate pawn and become a highclass devil and i will definitely bring victory for buchou thats what i must do i will definitely defeat sairaorgsan you started to make a face of a man thats whyi no even i buchou says something
next to me eh what is it i asked her but buchou made a little smile is it me or does she look a bit sadlife 2 a maidens heart is complicated part 1 hmm like i thought the biggest problem for the trianacombo would be the bishop huh riceballwe the gremory group are training hard in the training area which is located in the spacious field under the gremory territory kiba and i were doing a practice battle which is done in a style of an actual battle and then took a break away from us rossweissesan is tagging along with xenovias training and gasper and konekochan were supporting them buchou and akenosan were looking at them while giving advice to them asia is discussing about holyequations with irina the game is coming up so everyone is working with their respective training and after the individual trainings we will be reconfirming the team formation we basically do the following things everyday preparation of school festival devils job training yeah the problem for the trianatype bishop is its charging time i think you will be able to give great damage to the opponent with knight and rook if you dont
make a mistake on when to use it you can also make the opponent let their guard down if you can bend your blast after it is released kiba says that while wiping off his sweat its exactly like what this guy said each of the triana has weakness which could be spotted easily but i started to see a way to use knight and rook with the mock battle i had with kiba xenovia and rossweissesan overwhelming speed attack and defence can become the ultimate weapon if i use it at the right time its also my strong point that i can change into a specialised form of triaina repeatedly without buchous approval the problem is the bishop i have to charge the cannon after showing the cannonif the opponent sees the cannon and also the cannon charging then they wont wait for it if i need to charge the cannon in such an obvious appearance then there will be limited occasions i can use it the idea i got at the battle in kyoto at the very end the idea to bend the demonicpower i shot is actually very hard even in the form of trianatype bishop looks
like this will also depend on my training huh team battle and a cooperation with your comrades will be necessary as well i and xenovia will become the vanguard instead isekun will fall back to the rearguard to charge once you are done charging the fight will be ours there will only be limited number of devils in the baelgroup who can even take a hit of that ridiculously powerful cannon so a cooperation is a must huh certainly rather than blasting it by myself i will feel safe if my comrades buy time and i will be able to shoot it safely so how is the consumption condition kiba asks me hes asking me about the consumption condition of my stamina by using triana hmm compared to the first time i activated this ability it became more endurable than before but my stamina consumption is insane especially the combo a gear would be put on the consumption once i use promotion repeatedly it would be good if i can use it properly two or three times if i have to use it then it would be against sairaorgsan we have asias healing ability but even if we can get
our wounds healed we wont be able to heal our stamina if my stamina runs out during the match and i cant maintain my armor state then if its a team battle i will support you with everyone else if a situation like that arises ive also attained a new technique after all yeah this guy also attained a new technique its still a secret right now but he thought of something amazing thanks to that this training has gotten useful for me as well to be expected from my friend using the loss in kyoto as his strength uumm i just thought of something ravel who came to observe us seemed like she was listening to our conversation and she raises her handits about the specialform bishop from earlier but is it possible to shoot a power of transfer instead of a blast from the cannon if you do that it feels like you can expand your range to support kiba and i who heard such a suggestion we were for speechless for a moment but that sounds good we nodded our head at the same time i see so there is also a way to use it like
that bishop originally has a supportlike role and i can use the gauntlets ability to transfer the multiplied power in terms of energy if thats possible then we can expand the variety of tactics even when we show it for the first time instead of charging if we can use it to transfer the power to the comrade not only can we get the opponent off guard but it seems like we can rush towards them do you think we can make the opponent wonder by making them think is it a blast or is it a power transfer yeah i think we can make them shake quite a bit if its possible to transfer the power from long distance then there isnt any other ability more useful when you use it together while cooperating with your comrades if its the same as the usual transfer where you can transfer the power to two people at the same time you can increase the power of two vanguards since there are two cannons in terms of making a plan it will be necessary for more research but it certainly seems like an interesting test oo oooooooo amazing it seems like i
can become super useful in team battle more like i would become super useful in real battles she sure thinks of interesting things huh this ravel that is perhaps shes like a tacticiantype i want a strategist in my group in the future so i look up to those kind of people i think i would need a resourceful servant to back me up when i am the king i was getting my tension up andthe problem would be the game field i think it will be good if its a place where team battle is possible possibly the match between xenovia and rossweissesan finished so buchou who is the adviser came into our conversation ah xenovia and rossweissesan are on the ground over there it seems like it was a fierce battle intense sounds of the battle were going on for the whole time so they are down because they used up too much of their energy buchou continues on sairaorg told the higherups that he will take on everything we have and the higherups allowed that so there isnt a restraint on us like the match against sitri but it seems like the higherups added a special rule
while allowing that spspecial rule buchou nods at my word this time the stadium will be in a flyingcity located in the territory of archduke agaress territory it seems like they will take in lots of viewers so they arent looking for a longduration battle from the beginning flyingcity was there land floating in the underworld in the underworld such locations do exist so it truly seems like a fantasy and on top of that we have to participate in the game while a lot of people are watching us since there are viewers it means we wont have a game which lasts for a day or several days huh blitz13 if we have to make the viewers happy then it would seem like they will get heated up with a blitz buchou makes a bitter smile at me who was deep in thought rating game is also a form of entertainment so it cant be helped if there are parts where its focused on the fans preference in the underworld riassamas gremory group and sairaorgsamas baelgroup have popularity which doesnt even lose to that of a professional despite being a youth group who has yet to become aprofessional this
match has already gained much attention its even been brought up on the television every day ravel adds that hearing her say that it certainly seems like it will turn into a battlefield which will get good responses from the viewers hmm since i would have to continue being a devil it wont be good if i dont start to think about those aspects of the game it really is different from the real battle entertainment im an oppaidragon so maybe i have to heat it up with that perhaps since it seems like many children will come after all well but right now i have to work hard on training while believing in our victory thank you ravel it was a good advice when i gave her my gratitude iits obvious for me to help you at least with this if the place that is taking care of me was to lose in the precious match then even i would be embarrassed ravels face turned red and she replied back in her tsuntsun mode yes like ravel just said she started to live in the hyoudou residence from yesterday but because she is a genuine ojousama it seems like
there are many things she doesnt know while living in a place without her servants so she has to learn everything from scratch like using chopsticks to the way to use a washing machine ill also tag along with her and teach her things but ravel gets told off by konekochan every time that happens and they start a fight it really seems like konekochan and ravel are unable to cooperate every time they see each other they look away after saying hmph do cat and bird have bad compatibility more like its my first time seeing konekochan like that though it doesnt seem like both of them hate each other from the bottom of their hearts is it okay to think of them as fighting buddiesyeah i think ill leave it at that for now then i got up and said to kiba okay lets try if that way to transfer the power works or not i tried to resume my training after rising my spirit but this will be all for today buchou stopped us she then continues we have a press conference tomorrow if we continue to train we will be in bad shape tomorrow in front
of the reporters prpress conference i opened my eyes wide upon hearing that a press conference you say i made a dumb face while buchou adds additional information ara didnt i tell you it was decided that our group and sairaorgs group will have the pressconference together it will be broadcasted on television so dont put on a weird face okay eheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh i became shocked at this information i heard for the first time part 2 so just like that on the evening of the next day the place where we went to after finishing all the activities including school festival is a highclass restaurant located in the gremory territory currently we are on standby in the changing room located on the top floor it was just a spacious room there is expensive looking furniture and on top of the table there are fruits and cakes i had never seen before all lined up super expensive building even the way how it is constructed looks expensive tonight in the hall of this hotel located on the 2nd floor there will be a joint press conference of both the gremory group and bael group its simple it will be a heated
up interview before the gameit will be an interview focusing mainly on buchou and sairaorgsan ii will also be interviewed as well because im the oppaidragon wwhat am i supposed to say i dont know the topic they will ask me in the interview as well please send a message to all the beauties in the underworld maybe a reporter might ask me that like hell they would the ones who will be asked that will be sairaorgsan and kiba shit goodlooking guys sure are lucky at times like this they can send messages to all the devil women in the underworld i was sitting on the sofa while thinking those kind of things konekochan who is sitting on my lap is calm and shes digging into the cakes konekochan sure has guts even in these kinds of situation asia and rossweissesan are staying in front of the mirror saying things like will this be okay or does it look good or it doesnt and are desperate with their make up xenovia on the other hand is calm and she just did a light makeup buchou and akenosan are fully set its been decided that we will be wearing our
usual uniform for the press conference and maybe its because they have already put on their make up but buchou and akenosan look elegant even with their uniform they truly are beautiful the twogreat oneesama that is wait nows not the time to be fascinated by them doing this wont be able to lessen my nervousness gasperkun are you alright with wearing your usual girl uniform yyes it feels weird to wear a boys uniform for now more than that i dont want to goooo it will be out of place for a hikikomori like me to go to the press conference it seems like kiba and gasper are ready also dont go running into the box now gasperspeaking about kiba yeah thats right its regarding my triainaversion to transfer the power via cannon this morning i really wanted to try it so i had kiba tag along with me but it was really hard maybe its because the ability appeared as in purpose for attacking so it might be insanely hard to change the power i blast into the power of transfer to begin with its a crazy idea to shoot out something besides the demonicpower from the cannon
but it doesnt mean there is no possibility no i think it will be possible in the future but i realised that its not something i can master today or tomorrow so i wont be able to make it for the game if it becomes possible then i would be able to become useful as a support to my comrades right now i cant transfer my power unless i approach them i do think ravels idea is good though the truth is it would be faster for me to transform into triainaversion knight to get close to my allies and then transfer my power does it mean it would suit me if its an erotype or attackingtype your main is attacking after all though there were those which specialised in transferring their power among the past hosts is that true ddraig how can you fight with transferring the power they transferred their power to many things and also increased the speed of many effects for example there was one who was a summoning and seirei magic user so by transferring the power to the seirei and creatures that person created a way to fight with a variety of battling style
hmm so there was a senpai like that that person is an opposite wielder like me since i have no talent in demonicpowers a wizardtype sekiryuutei so there was an era like that huh wait this isnt the time for that its right before the press conference the clock is ticking i probably should check myself for the last time in the mirror then thats what i was thinking but konekochan isnt going to move from my lap today she has been walking while pulling my uniform sleeves and it seems she has been attached to me more than usualkonekochan then makes her cheeks red probably because she realised i was suspicious of her today the yakitori isnt here so i want to be on senpais lap akenosan then smiled hearing that ara ara looks likes konekochan thinks ravelchan will take isekun away from her hearing akenosan say that konekochan get embarrassed iis that true i asked her timidly and she answers me while putting on an unpleasant face senpai is too kind so i get troubled many times because of it im not really sure but it seems like she was frustrated that i was with ravel the whole
time she thought she would have me her senior taken away by ravel oh my so im being depended on from a junior who is a girl i also think konekochan is adorable as well so dont be worried i said that but konekochan still kept an unpleasant face ah but her tail is swirling so is she feeling a bit better now when konekochan and i were having such a conversation buchou who was looking yes ise is too kind to anyone i no its nothing says that with a low tone i became suspicious of buchou who seems a bit down her eyes seem a bit sad as well hhmmm buchou has been acting weird lately did something happen then the door of this changing room opened its the staff everyone its almost timelooks like the pressconference is about to start im getting nervous it happened while we were on our way we encountered someone who we are familiar with ah riassenpai hyoudou and the rest of the occult research club members its saji why is he here saji what are you doing here when i said that he shrugged his shoulder wwhats with that reaction you sure
say a harsh thing well it cant be helped our match was decided while it didnt get that much attention we are also going to have a match against agares we are having the press conference today whwhaaaaaaaaaaaaaat wwhat did you just say its my first time hearing about this i got surprised and buchou then tells me after tilting her head didnt i tell you sona will also be having a match at the same time as us against seegvaira agares they will also fight in the agaress territory and i think their stadium is going to be above the islands floating on the lakes i didnt hear it just like the press conference arent you lacking in notifying me about things before hand buchou maybe it cant be helped because we have been busy with the school festival and the preparation for the game saji made a bitter smile its like i said right that we arent receiving any attention after all your match will be between the infamous gremory group with the oppai dragon and riassenpai against the number 1 youth sairaorg baels groupsob im sorry saji if i knew about this before we could have encouraged
each other hes also in the student council so they must be having a hard time with the preparations for the school festival genchan lets get going it will be bad if we go late riassenpai we will be going then the bishop hanakaisan from the sitrigroup says that to saji ah yeah thats right then we will be off then yes goodbye say hi to sona for me buchou replied back bowing his head down saji leaves this place i see the sitri also will be having a game huh the opponent will be the archduke agares so that cool and scarylooking beauty will be their opponent huh i heard that she is a tactician who is comparable to kaichou it seems like the match will be about them trying to read each others movements and will turn into a mud fight it seems like it will be a match experts would like after meeting with saji we continued to progress through the corridor and we showed up in the hall which will become the place for the press conference it seems like they have arrived the gremorygroup has arrived inside the applause we go into the spacious hall
the moment i entered the feeling of nervousness hits me it feels like this place is filled with fighting spirit uwaa but there sure are so many people they must be reporters and other media personnel they are all looking at us they are even taking pictures of us above the seats for the press conference hall there is a curtain which is written sairaorg bael vs rias gremory in devil letters and the bael group is already there after a moment we sat on the seats for the gremory group buchou is sitting in the center akenosan is sitting to her right and im sitting to her left the seats are arranged to gather attentionon the baelside especially from sairaorgsan i can feel intense spirit emitting from his body so the thing i felt when i first entered was sairaorgsans fighting spirit huh his expression is also quite serious he is totally different from the time i met him back at the hospital maybe the fight between us has already begun from this press conference on the second row behind us gaspers eyes were opening and closing and it seems like he is enduring the embarrassment do your best
hikikomori this is the critical moment for you since everyone from both sides has gathered i would like to start the press conference the person who will be the host said that and the press conference began basic information about the games outline the date and such was explained to us from the host and after that he asked the opinions of both kings of buchou and sairaorgsan both of them acted grandly and the dignity they held was amazing i sat down quietly when my master and comrades were talking i cant put on any weird faces the reporters might write a weird article with even a single movement stay calm stay calm while my hands are getting sweaty the conference progresses accordingly and finally the time to question the members from both groups who have gathered much attention has come the girls of our gremory group who hold vast amounts of popularity from the men answered back to the questions and kiba who is also popular amongst women also answers without any trouble then finally the question was directed at me i will ask hyoudou isseisan aka oppaidragon who is very popular in the underworld a question now
yyeswwhat kind of question will i be asked maybe something like my type of women or my opinion towards the game while my head was dazzling with things like that the question i received was will you also be poking princess riass breast this time as well if you were to poke then in what kind of situation would you poke them my brain became blank because of the question i totally didnt anticipate uumm while putting on a weird face i could only say that but the reporter continues just like the tokusatsu programme we received the information that you power up by poking princess riass breasts we also heard that you overcame many crises because of it that sure is a horrible question i see so the information that i power up by poking breasts is known all throughout the underworld huh the impression of me is out of control its even worse because that is the truth but it will be bad if i dont answer back you see bububucho no that isnt it i became too nervous that i was about to say buchou it will be bad for me to call her that in front
of many people i need to call her master and such thats what i thought but it was bad that i didnt speak properly buchuu were you just about to say buchu so that means you will be sucking it like buchuu as in her breast suddenly i received many flashes from the camera and even the reporters started to make noises wwwwwwwwwwwwwhat kind of misunderstanding did you geeeeeeeeet these idiotic reporteeeeeers i didnt say buchu i was trying to say buchou idiots are you dumb the outrageous misunderstanding was heading towards the outrageous directiondoes that mean you will be sucking princess riass breast no theres no way i will be proposing that im going to suck breast in front of all these people if you power up by poking breasts what will happen if you suck it is it possible for the underworld to collapse like hell i would know that dumbass are you mistaking me for a breastmaou who can destroy the world by sucking breasts or something princess rias please give us your comment regarding this the question was finally directed towards buchou buchou has her face very red who seems very embarrassed and is covering her
face with both her hands ii dont know thats right akenosan who is next to buchou couldnt control herself and is blurting out laughing aaah laugh all you want then contender sairaorg what do you think you dumb reporter dont ask himmm sairaorgsan answers with a serious expression hmm it will seem like the sekiryuutei will become insanely strong when he sucks riass breast oooooooooooo the groups of reporters started to make a noise after hearing that sairaorgsaaaaaan why are you also saying those kinds of thinnnnngs just like that the tensed atmosphere of the press conference disappeared and it finished in a situation filled with laughter hahahahahahahahaafter the press conference the gremory group and the bael group and sairaorgsan was laughing very lively no sorry but when i get involved with you guys amusing things happen all the time since its before the match i came into the hall while raising my fighting spirit but i sure had it taken away from me no no instead i was able to relax mou dont you also say something weird sairaorg buchou who has a red face and even tears on her eyes was mad at sairaorgsan she must have been
really embarrassed iim sorry buchou i embarrassed her again because of me let it be as a result we didnt have a messy press conference but one with lots of things people can talk about im looking forward to the morning newspaper tomorrow i dont if an article which says oppaidragon this time he will suck comes out i wont be able to face the people from house of gremory sairaorgsan then takes a breath while putting on a smile i see so this is what it feels like to fight the sekiryuutei the oppaidragon i never thought we would have to compete even in the comments for the press conference iim sorry for acting like thati wasnt trying to make a fool out of everyone i apologised but sairaorgsan shook his head to the side that isnt true i didnt mind its the opposite i feel some mysterious power from you guys who can start a thing like that in a place where everyone has their attentions on us sairaorgsan is usually a strict person but he showed his playful side at the press conference so we have to fight with someone like him who treats us very friendly
by having our dreams on the line sairaorgsan turns around and leaves while waving his hands at usit was fun tonight so the next time we will meet is at the final battle lets meet above the sky then the next place we will meet is at the place for our battle yes the press conference has finished and the date for our match is approaching us i definitely dont want to lose part 3 ah im so scared to see the underworlds morning newspaper tomorrow i was complaining while going inside the bigbath located at the basement of the hyoudou residence after the press conference we returned home and so returned back to our usual daily life im so embarrassed that i would die after remembering what happened at the press conference so i decided to take a bath to change my mood the spacious bigbath of the hyoudou residence it was added when the house got a huge renovation and it seems like there will still be enough space even with twenty people inside just in case there is a regular bath on the first floor it seems like all the girls living here take a bath while
washing each other its made so even my family can also use this place but mum ordered to dad please take a bath on the first floor so only dad is using the bath on the first floor this is a consideration made because there are girls living here dad also doesnt want to start an international problem so he agreed to it and is using the bath on the first floor now it has become a dadonly bath it seems like it isnt bad to monopolise a bathtub well it certainly wont be bad to have your own bathtub mum also told me not to take a bath here but i use it when i have a chancehaving a luckysukebe encounter to meet the girls naked would be an awesome situation i mean look how magnificent this bath is i also want to use it staying inside the bath wont even change my mood at all maybe its because the match is coming up so it also might be the fact that my tension is rising its going to be a match with our dreams on the line after all okay then i will go inside the sauna now
yes this bigbath has a complete set which comes with a sauna and coldbath the finance of the gremory household is terrifying indeed theres no loss in having extra getting inside the sauna i stayed there doing nothing for ten minutes quite a lot of sweat has come out from my whole body if i take a cold bath after this looks like i can feel refreshed once i get out of the bath im going to drink a chilled coffee milk it happened when i was thinking of leaving here the door opens and a fully nakedbuchouuuuuuuu ara ise not even wearing a single towel buchou is in front of me in the state she was born in she doesnt even try to hide her body even after knowing that im inside why are you so daring buchou uummm ii i hid my manhood with my hands and tried to leave but buchou took my hand and stops me from going its okay stay with me for a bit its okay i will look all over your body you know thank you very much i sat next to buchou and gazed at her erotic body which is so irresistible
maybe she took a bath or just washed her body but her wet and long crimson hair is sticking onto her body so her body looks spicier than usualbuchou waves back her hair with her hand while crossing her legs the moment she crosses her legs is so seductive that i end up swallowing down my spit im alone with buchou inside a single room my body gets overheated because of the heat from the sauna and the desire inside me which is rising up shit if i were man enough i would have wanted to push her down its only the two of us if i was to be pushed down by ise here what would happen to me buchousama says something erotic like that to me please spare me right now im in a state where i cant control myself but since you must be familiar with my body already so you might not feel like that tthats not true buchous body is the best we exchanged a conversation that we usually have buchou teases me and i answer back our usual exchange where buchou enjoys me acting shy but this time it was different buchou takes my
hand and munyuu she places it on her breast buchous body which has gotten wet with sweat gives a stimulating sensation to my hand buchou then whispered very charmingly if thats how you really feel then push me down right here buchou says that with a slightly red expression with a bit of sadness in her expression pussssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssh her downnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn right now me to buchoui was horrified and buchou asks me hey to ise what ami buchou is buchou nothing more nothing less yes inside me buchou is a one and only kind of person thats why buchou is buchou hearing me say that it seemed like buchou is grinding her teeth buchou then grabbed my hand tightly if thats the case then i just have to become more than that buchou then leaned her body towards mei was being pushed down by buchou on the place where we sit in the sauna buchou is on top of me the sensation of the very soft body of a woman hits me my arms chest stomach and legs every single part of my body is in contact with her soft skin her ooppai is compressed down against my chest and the
size and elasticity of it is amazing there is no doubt that the pointy things i can feel are her nipples my brain begins to boil what a situation to be pushed down in the locked sauna room by the woman i love and buchou is riding on top of me this this is it means that right finally its finally here my first time buchou being my first time is simply the best there isnt anything more fortunate than thiss i blinked as i dont know where to put my hands what should i do where do i put my hands which do i touch first her butt her thighs like i thought her oppai first since our bodies are touching each other i can feel buchous pulse directly to my body im so nervous that my heart is pumping fast but buchou is also feeling nervous let me feel you ise buchou and my lips overlaps kiss this isbad my brain is about to melt because our tongues are tangled my tongue is being sucked by buchou kuchu chup an obscene sound echoes in the sauna room that sound made my whole body feel some unknown sensation everytime
i gulp down buchous saliva which came inside my mouth it feels like my eyes will sparkle this is bad it will completely turn me on the wet crimson hair which falls down on my face her hair which has a nice smell of shampoo comes into my nostrils and it turns my brain into a flower gardenher tongue leaves my mouth and there is a thread of saliva between our lips we have already kissed many times but this time there is more passion in it looks like i have to be prepared im going to make love to buchou here so my first time would be inside the sauna room so will i remember this being all sweaty bubuchoui exactly at that moment buchou stops after hearing what i said buchou you still call the woman you are about to make love toeven if i do this muchbuchou buchou got up expressionless she had so much seductive expression until just before and now she has an expression where she looks emotionless to you what am i buchou separates herself from me i also moved but buchou has her whole body shaking she then tries to leave the sauna
room immediately wwhat happened did i do something bad buchou what happ dont follow me speaking over me buchou yelled her voice was mixed with cries buchou left idont know what just happened and i could only look down at the drops of tears buchou left on the floor when she left part 4 after school next day i made a deep sigh in the clubroom what i have in my hand is the underworld newspaper oppaidragon is going to buchuu suck the switchit was a horrible article like i predicted i started to feel dizzy geez actually this isnt my concern right now thats because there is a another problem last night i displeased buchou after that when i got out of the bath there was a paper sticked on the door to my room which read ise not permitted and i couldnt enter the room until this morning apparently buchou slept with asia so i slept in the unused room it sure was a lonely night even when i woke up buchou was still mad and even though she talked to me it was a plain conversation where she didnt give me her smile the girls also realised
it and everyone asked me did something happen i answered them that i dont know but everyone said no its definitely your fault and everyone was saying that im the bad one wwell it probably is my fault what kind of mistake did i make in that situation i dont have a clue i hear that women seek for romantic atmospheres so i think the reason is somewhere there my actionwas bad i guess but what kind of mistake did i make what comes to my mind is the word buchous mother told me when i saw her the other day it feels like the answer lies somewhere there but it doesnt mean that the wild delusion i have is possible in fact it seems totally off the mark in private life what kind of existence is buchou to me buchous mothers words are going around in circles in my head something that isnt a masterservant relationship one of the answers pops up in my head but that seems too farfetched and its more like my delusion also what should i do if my guess is wrong again she appears back in my head the fallenangel raynarethe woman who deceived
me my first girlfriend its a horrible memory because of that experience i became someone who cant take everything to the last step i had a nail impaled deep within my heart even till nowi cant get it out i want to get along even more with the girls in our group but i stop half way shit im so weak im so pathetic i understand that myself but even so i cant do anything about it but i want to tell my feelings to buchou when will i be able to move forward i should stop thinking about it there is going to be an important meeting with azazelsensei regarding the game the other ones in the clubroom are kiba and gasper everyone else hasnt come yet the churchtrio who are in the same class as me headed towards the new school building to get some fabric for the school festival preparation buchou and akenosan arent here as well only the guys yo gasper how are those two behaving in the class i then decided to talk to gasper yyes konekochan and ravelsan are arguing at every little thing konekochan who is usually quiet gives harsh comments to ravelsan
so both of them havent changed huh bbut even though konekochan is complaining about ravelsan who isnt familiar with the lifestyle in the humans world she still looks after her and ravelsan also follows konekochan even though she scolds her is that so even though they say that both of them sure are bonding nicely hhmm it made me confused even more a maidens heart sure is complicatedi said that while looking up at the ceiling and both of them have probably realised the person that each of them are always thinking of thats why they argue with each other every time something happens even more so since they are in the same year sensei who just entered says that while looking into my face wwhat do you mean sensei well koneko will follow what you told her and will continue to look after ravel in her class and ravel will also rely on koneko to adapt to the humans world lifestyle haais that how it turned out i replied back with no strength in my words it seems like i cant become useful to ravelsan like how konekochan can mmore like it seems like i cant be useful to
everyone in both the private life and in battle gasper said that while feeling a bit down your eyes have been allowed to be used for this battle and you are able to carry a bottle with my blood in it now do you still feel uneasy when i asked gasper nods i dont have courage and strength like how isesenpai does i also cant use swords like how yuutosenpai does as well i would be happy if i can at least be useful at supportingbut as a boy i feel ashamed of myself so he wants to be useful for the group as a guy even though he dresses like a girl he is a guy afterall okay i will give him some lessons then gasper engrave the things what im about to tell you into your heart gremory groups males lesson 1 a man has to protect a girl hey repeat after me a mman has to protect a girlgood then next one gremory groups males lesson 2 a man has to stand up no matter what a mman has to stand up no matter what lastly gremory groups males lesson 3 dont give up no matter what
ddont give up no matter what good you just have to engrave that into your heart and fight just like a man from the gremorygroup yyes i will engrave them within myself and work haaaaard oh he sure has high spirits kiba was also making a small laugh that sound good i think i will engrave that in my heart as well you do just that not giving up even if anything happens is what a man from the gremorygroup has to be that sure sounds annoying sensei says that with his eyes half opened while looking at our conversation while the guys were getting heated up like that buchou and the other members came in i looked at buchoubut she was still expressionless even though she knows that im looking at her shes still mad what should i do from now on if buchou continues to hate me i became a bit shocked sensei then looks around all of us and says it then we will begin our meeting the first thing sensei said with a serious face was this before starting the meeting for the upcoming game there are things i want to discuss regarding the situations of
each faction it seems theres going to be a bit of trouble regarding the sacred gears what do you meankiba asks and sensei continues you guys should know that the herofaction has been researching about the balancebreaker since you guys did experience it with your own body yup we certainly experienced that back in kyoto those guys sure did know a lot about how to use sacred gears more than that it seems like they also knew a lot about our sacred gears and its characteristics its the total opposite of senseis knowledge towards sacred gears it seems like they were putting their hands on the forbidden types of research they shouldnt touch and even try to do its said that they started to teach the ways to reach balancebreaker to the sacred gear possessors who are mixed up within the common people that arent part of the herofaction and to the reincarnated devils who are also sacred gear possessors teaching the way to reach balancebreaker to common people who are sacred gear possessorsand to the reincarnateddevils who are also sacred gear possessors iisnt that a bad thing to begin with balancebreaker is something which gives you huge powers sensei
nods after seeing my expression so what will it result in if someone who has been having an unfortunate life has their life changed all of a sudden and if they attained a power which is said to break the balance of the world then their views towards the world will change like you all know not everyone who possesses sacred gear has been having a good life it isnt rare for those who have been persecuted and discriminated due to having power different from other people there are cases where the possessors were reincarnated into a devil with an unfair deal and were turned into a servant buchou continues from where sensei stopped not all devils are fair after all and there are those among highclass devils who are cruel as well there are those who have developed different ways of thinking due to the human world but naturally the devils are those who have logical ways of thinkingsacred gear possessors who have been reincarnated in a forceful way and those guys attaining balancebreaker sensei continues yeah there are sacred gear possessors who are currently living while having tasted such unfairness so what will happen if guys like that
learn how to use their powers and attain an overwhelming power the balancebreaker while everyone became silent sensei says it while having his expression darker they will use it their power that is if its humans they might use it on their revenge against others and if its a reincarnated devil who possesses sacred gears they would think of paying back their master who has treated them cruelly this is bad so it means that a revolt might be occurring in the human world and the underworld on top of that in the balancebreaker state after all there are many sacred gear possessors who are dissatisfied with their current situation that would be scary when i told him what i really think sensei nods his head yeah it would be a scary thing in many ways the limits of what humans can achieve a challenge to the superior beings for those herofaction guys who have been researching about balance breaker so you can say that the things which will happen from now will be one of their results they have gained its a matter of time for the sacred gear possessors who are somewhere in the human world and the
underworld who hold a dissatisfaction to start a revolt so the actions that the herofaction has already done have reached the core of something serious huh sensei then says it with a scary face so we have been totally fooled we still dont know how it will end for them who are terrorists but its certain that we received a heavy blow from themit will definitely affect things from now on its regrettable but they sure have succeeded once again i realised the scariness of humans in the near future there might be incidents occurring amongst the highclass devils in my casethanks to my master buchou who is kind the sacred gear possessors among us which are me asia kiba and gasper dont even feel dissatisfaction but rather we are living our lives happily every day i understand that not all of us are like that the shadowuser possessor who came against me back at kyoto he sounded like his life changed after being taught how to use his power and the way to use it if someone who has been having a painful life attains a power which can change their lives thenthey will use it huh and it
means people like that will appear a lot from now hey the god from the bible who is said to be dead why did you make the sacred gear system and what was on your mind was it to save the humans was it to save those in need was it to give birth to heroes or yuusha if you created them because its convenient and to make their lives better it isnt working that much it became a very delicate thing so that it can create revolts and war in various locations because of it there are those which can even kill godlevel beings one of those even resides in me if i walked a different path would i also have been siding with those who cause destruction i dont want to think about it the atmosphere inside the club room became serious sensei realised it so he made a cough oh my bad thats right today i came here as the adviser for the match against sairaorg thats right the meeting the match against bael is coming up we have to get some advices from sensei before the battle and i have to investigate them with everyone to
change the atmosphere of the clubroom i raised my hand and asked senseidoes sairaorgsan also have someone like sensei who acts as his adviser yeah like always the adviser of the gremory group is azazelsensei to have the leader of one of the factions as our adviser we are quite blessed among the youth well it seems like sensei gives advice to the sitri group quite often as well and if the people he gives advice to arent dangerous people then it seems like he will teach them many things yeah they also have one too it seems like the emperorsama is with them diehauser belial the one who responded the most to senseis words is buchou in the future for buchou who wants to attain titles on each game he is her aim that is the current champion emperor belial will he also become a big obstacle when i become independent and participate in the game well if rias and ise are going to participate in the game as a highclass devil then you can see him as your big aim after you officially participate in the game the members of the group also wont be able to avoid
him if their master decided to participate in the game sensei says that now then have you guys memorised the data about sairaorgs group right everyone and i nod our heads at senseis question yeah no problem we researched a lot about sairaorgsans group well the only thing we know right now are their abilities even so not knowing and knowing it can change our enthusiasm towards the match so we repeatedly watched the video of their match against glasyalabolas sensei activates the holographic vision in the air each of the baelgroups members appears with their parameters sensei says it while looking at themit seems like there were those who didnt show their full power in the match against glasyalabolas well during that match the brat from the glasyalabolas challenged sairaorg in oneonone after all so sairaorg basically finished the game also sensei says it while crossing his arms sairaorg and his group are rare devils who actually train just like you guys they definitely have leveledup during the time back in their match against glasyalabolas yeah baelgroup are also devils who do a rare thing called working hard just like us they train every day and are increasing their
strength so they must be more powerful than the time this video was recorded its said that they also fought even against the khaos brigade so they have experience in dangerous real battles looks like the opinions of yondaimaou sirzechs and the other maou of i do not want the young ones to be taken out into war as much as possible has gone in vain well there are young devils like you guys who encounter reckless battles after all sensei says that while making a bitter smile thats totally true i just want to live peacefully but i ended up encountering a god and a guy with the ultimate longinus you know i never thought i would encounter a transcendental kind of battle in kyoto even if its my destiny this is too disastrous then rossweissesan who has a serious face speaks this pawn from the opponents side didnt appear in the video correct all of us look at the same direction a person wearing a cyber looking mask is shown his name also just written as pawn pawn sairaorgsans group consists of 1 queen 2 rook 2 knight 2 bishop and their group formation looks similar to us
and this pawn i dont see other pawns in baelgroup just this masked person at the press conference the reporter also questioned sairaorg bael possibly about this person as wellkiba says i was nervous so i dont remember but was sairaorgsan asked such a question at the press conference if this masked person was there with us he would have had a strong impact and i would have remembered him then this masksan wasnt present at the press conference then apparently that pawn is a guy who sairaorg barely uses so there is barely any information about him since he is wearing a mask we dont even know who he is he was revealed for the first time for this match then that means sairaorg would be using him for the other games from now since it seems like sairaorg tries not to have this guy have contact with others as much as possible the only rumours i heard about him is that he used 6 or 7 pawn pieces thats why the only pawn sairaorg has is him 6 7 all of us shouted at the same time because of the shocking revelation 7 i used up 8 if
this guy indeed did used up 7 then that means hes quite a skillful opponent or has high potential powers sensei continues since we dont have all the data about him you should approach the match by being very cautious of this pawn to begin with any type of guys are around to fight for this match after all sairaorgs secret weapon its like his tigercub huh tigercub oh yeah sairaorgsans mother came from the household which governs the lion its scary to think what kind of opponent he would be well would it turn into a sudden fight without knowing anything about him no i cant think like that i also need to use my brain even more after that buchou stood in front of us and talked about the strategy for the game and countermeasures against the opponents and all of us memorised them irina who was with us was listening to it with great interest ravel on other hand was working hard taking notes of it ravel sure likes to learn having finished our discussion i raised my hand and asked sensei about what has been in my mindsensei if we participate in the official rating game
what is the chance of us colliding with the champion in the future it will be okay from senseis perspective you guys along with sairaorg are youths with abnormal strength im saying this because this group is a gathering of many powerful members even though you guys havent participated in the official game yet and also experience in real battlesyou guys especially have an experience fighting worldlevel foes on top of that everyone survived things like that dont happen often and you guys are seen as a bigshot newcomers team you guys should be able to aim quite high when you participate in the official game its just a matter of time for you guys to get into the top10 we received very high praises from the governor of the fallenangels we felt very shy and sensei continues but because of that you have a lot of attention from the underworld in the next game the whole underworld will be watching you you guys are already famous for stopping the evilgod loki and the terrorists on top of that you guys managed to heat up the press conference that much and the residents of the underworld have witnessed the new
breeze of the future of the devils future of the devils sounds so grand of course the current toprankers of the game would be paying attention to you guys and sairaorg and will be starting to research about you guys who will become a new enemy to them thats a good inclination the toprankers of the game who have barely moved i get excited by thinking that you guys and sairaorg would be amongst them in the future which is not that far sensei then says it after smiling lively change it the rating game that is the top10 rankers and the emperor you young ones are going to beat them up and create a new flow of the rating game we are going to change it the rating game by defeating the champion and we will become the champions i want to become itchampion the conqueror of the game i also want to become a haremking but being the champion of the rating game might not be bad and most of alli want to make buchou the champion thats because that is the dream buchou seeks i have so many dreams and ambitions maybe i am a devil who
has so much greed but i want to fulfill all those dreams no i am going to fulfill it part 5 after school after the meeting ended sensei and rossweissesan left because they still have things to do as teachers we prepare for the school festival with the remaining members looks like me and kiba have to do power related tasks i then glanced at buchou shes looking at the documents used at the meeting and is reading it she still hasnt returned to her good mood hmm what should i do if i dont reconcile with her before the game im scared that it might cause difficulties apologisingit seems like she wont forgive me unless i acknowledge the cause and apologise to her and i dont know the cause of it hmm it happened when i was having my head all puzzled over it a light runs through the top of the table the light drew a circle and turns into a shape of a magiccircle its a familiar symbol phoenix konekochan mutters thats right its exactly like konekochan said this is the magiccircle of phoenix its a small magiccircle which has the size to appear on top of
the table so is it a communicationtype but who dont tell me its raiser what does he wanti was in suspicions but from the magiccircle a holographic image was projected and the face of a young woman appears she has a highclass atmosphere and looks she has her hair up and adorned with expensive looking accessories okaasama ravel made a shocking voice okaasama ravels mother so that means she is the wife of the current head of the house of phoenix which also makes her the mother of raiser shes pretty she looks like she is in her twenties since she is a devil i dont know her real age but she certainly looks like ravel how do you do ravel sorry for the sudden call i couldnt get any time so i ended up calling at this hour in the humans world japan its still school time right yyes it certainly is but why did you call all of a sudden when ravel asks lady phoenix says are riassan and sekiryuuteisan here the one who was called by her is buchouand me why me buchou stands in front of the projection how do you do obaasama its been awhile
ara riassan how do you do it certainly has been awhile and the lady looks around is she looking for me i positioned myself where she can see me immediately ah hello im hyoudou issei hello to you too this is our first time meeting like this isnt it hyoudou isseisan of the sekiryuutei i apologise for introducing myself like this nno sso do you have some business with me i ask while acting politely yes i thought i should greet you properly normally i should go and greet myself to riassan who is in charge of the hyoudou residence andthe academy which my daughter will be homestaying at but there were reasons why we couldnt visit you know since the demands of the phoenixs tear are increasing so maybe they dont have time because of it kiba whispers to my ears ah i see house of phoenix are the main suppliers for the phoenixs tears after all i heard that there are emergency demands on the phoenixs tears and that they cant keep up with the supplies so the lady must be with it as well that must be hard its much appreciated seriously buchou replies while smiling not
at all obasama your words would be enough please leave ravel to us im truly sorry riassan for having you take care of raiser after the game and also having you look after ravel it seems like she isnt saying it with bad intentions i thought they would hold a grudge against us because the engagement was cancelled but it seems like they dont even have a bit of it there are so many big hearted people in the house of phoenix but for buchou it must be complicated after all she couldnt decline the transfer of ravel and to look after her then the lady looks at me also hyoudou isseisan please especially look after my daughter mme too and she emphasised the word especially of course i would look after her yyes of course but buchou is also here and there are people who can look after her better than me in our club yes of course by entrusting my daughter ravel to riassan and everyone else then she would have no trouble at the school in the underworld but what i would like to ask of you is different from that will you please protect her so

course looks like the mother and daughter are talking about something i dont know why but ravel has her face red and it looks like she is filled with spirits and lastly hyoudou isseisan the lady talks to me again yyes i hear that your dream is to become a highclass devilyes it isand my daughter is currently my bishop i traded with raiser yyes i have heard please remember it very well my daughter is free she is my bishop she doesnt belong to raiser very well yyes uunderstood thats something i already know but well i just nod my head just in case hearing that the lady nods her head she looks satisfied why my business here is done riassan hyoudou isseisan and everyone please forgive my sudden introduction and its time now ravel behave in a manner where you wont make a shame as a lady yes okaasama now then everyone good bye flash the light brightens it then turns into a shallow light and disappears the greetings of lady phoenix which came here like a storm it must be due to worrying about her daughter and the greetings to us though there were things im not
sure of i was in doubts and made a sigh and buchou who was about to leave the room unsteadily on her foot appears within my sight bubuchou where are you going when i asked buchou stops and she mutters without turning around ise will you protect me why do you ask such a thing suddenly i dont know but my answer is obviousof course i will protect buchou and asia eh yes i will also protect asia and akeno akenosan that is obvious but what happened suddenly asking me such a thing i dont get it i dont get what buchous intention are at all but buchou asks with a lower tone hey ise yyes to you what am i who am i i dont get the meaning of this question but to me ummm to me buchou is buchou and the moment i said that baka she scolds me mixed with a sound of her crying buchou rushes away from the spot and she left the clubroom riasoneesama asia goes after buchou asia turns to me after she reaches the door her eyesare soaked with tears why is asia crying isesan you are horrible its too much why
cant you why cant you understand oneesamas feelings saying that asia goes after buchou having asia also say that to me i just stood there dumbfounded wa wait a sec whats the meaning of this why is asia also mad at me that wasnt right isekun kiba makes a sigh nnot right as in what that precisely geez you are so i can understand very well what the girls are going through exactly its natural for rias and asiachan to get mad akenosan also sounded mad even akenosan even i who is dense at these sorts of things thought you were a bit off ise even xenovia looks at me with her eyes halfclosed mou isekun sure is a nono poor riassan even irina was mad you are the worst ooooooo i just received the coldest you are the worst quote from konekochan i dont know what i did wrong i just dont know to begin with maybe i should go after her i tried to leave but i was stopped by akenosan the current isekun will just hurt her more even if you go after her so dont seriously is it that serious bbut its my fault right my
fault i really dont know no i actually have a maybe kind of guess but inside me that possibility is very unlikelyits basically impossible thats why i dont understand shit i started to get confused even more thinking about it hey gasper am i really bad here i asked my junior gyasuke says it in apologetic manner while twitching his body umm yes i think you are very bad even gasper says that to me i felt down then ravel asks while panicking uummthis is my mother and my fault right im sorry is itravels fault it seemed like buchou tried to leave after the communication between the phoenix mother and child akenosan places her hand on ravels shoulders ravelchan doesnt have to worry about it isekuns the most at fault here because he never tried to think about the crucial thing between rias and himself until now akenosan cheers her up like that and she started to prepare for tea after urging ravel to sit on the sofa it looks like im the biggest villain here uuu what am i supposed to do part 6 man why is everyone acting like that what do they want me to do
i mutter to myself in an empty room within the oldschool building after that we continued to prepare for the school festival under akenosans instruction the atmosphere of that situation was settled down after akenosan took responsibility to find buchou and asiai was continuing to do work by myself within the empty room kiba and gasper went out to buy things this room is the place where we will be doing a fake purification for the school festival if we do an actual purification it would be dangerous for us since we are devils so we are doing a ritual which is kind of similar to it but with an original creative idea which is like a devilstyle purification which contradicts to our kinds what im doing is a decoration to make it look japanesestyle i put down a tatami14 and have to put furniture to make it look like a japanese shrine well on the day of the school festival the plan is that akenosan will be in charge here where konekochan will use her senjutsu to make the flow of the ki inside our customers better and increase their luck phew but it sure makes you think when
you are just by yourself i was remembering about what happened just before its my fault huh i didnt think about the important thing between me and buchou thats what akenosan said lately not just buchou but buchous mother and everyone else around me is seeking something from me and that has to do with my attitude towards buchou the things which i was thinking about before the meeting comes back to me in my head im thinking about two major things one is that i didnt understand buchous feelings and that i hurt her feelings without realising it the other one is that thing is truly like a fantasy to me and even if i want to think that it is true its a development which i cant step my foot in but if that truly is the case then it perfectly explains everything till now the way how buchou confronts me after moving into my house i was always in doubt about it there are three guys in the gremorygroup me kiba and gasper even if buchou is a devil who is thoughtful towards her servants and has stronglove towards us its weird that there are differences in
how she treats the other guys in our group she kisses me yeah she comes and kisses me not to my cheek or forehead mouth to mouth we have also tongue kissed not just once but several times even i feel happy about it a kiss with the woman i love you know of course i would be happy i even think that im in heaven she even asks me for an ecchi situation we even went so far as to almost doing it first i thought that buchou did it because she has deep love towards her servants and she did it to me because im younger than her and i also thought that it was her way of connecting with the guys in our group and was a special service to us but if that was the case then it wouldnt be weird if she does them with kiba and gasper but kiba and gasper said she doesnt do anything like that to them they said she just does them to me of course buchou adores kiba and gasper and thinks of them preciously but there is an obvious difference between me and them originally buchou was fixated
on the thing called love she had so much pure and innocent obsession to it and she had feelings which were very maidenlike where she behaved liked girls her age thats why she broke off her engagement with raiser thats right after she became free buchou started to have more physical contact with me she also started to live in my house around then will buchou who has pure thoughts regarding the relation between man and woman do such a seductive motion on me just because of me being her adorable servant no she wonti think even from an objective view point you can tell buchou has a strong sense towards her chastity if i include those facts and also think of buchous attitude towards me doesbuchou like me that will be the answer i get if that is the case then her attitude towards me matches upnno there is no way shes my master im her servant her servant devil im rias gremorys pawn bbut but iif buchou does indeed like me then i like buchou also as a master but more than that as a single girl during these six months i have seen many sides of buchou
her magnificent side her noble side her glamorous side her gentle side her angry side the part where she has big oppai her cute side the part where she has a smooth skin her spoiled side and the part where she is like my oneesama yet she acts as the same age as me and then i started see her as a normal girl and to me she is the ideal woman i want to go out with her i want to go past the masterservant relationship and date her as a man and woman if i can wish for it i want to be with her even in the future but is it true that she likes me if thats true then i would be in joy where my body would shake with happiness instead i am the one who wants to confess this feeling i have which is increasing day by day im in love with her i love her i always loved her i just love buchou and i want to confess to her but what would i do if im wrong the relation we currently have will end i dont want that when i think like
that the one which passes my mind isher i started to have weird sweat coming from my face my hands are shaking as well at the same time the hot feeling i had until just now started to cool down no like i thought my relation with buchou is just a fantasy if i ask for even morethe relation we have right now will definitely end i would realise it the wall of master and servant which you can not overcome hahahaha told you yeah it will definitely turn out like that to begin with i wont be able to match up with a princess from a family of highclass devils since im a formerhuman who was raised in a normal familythen what is that attitude of buchou damn it the heart of a maiden sure is complicated when i was muttering to myself i heard the sound of the door opening and when i looked around akenosan in her miko wear was standing there ufufu maybe it does seem like that from a mans perspective she approaches me with her usual smiley face ah konekochan is behind her as well aakenosan and konekochan you were listening to me all
of it konekochan approves by putting her thumb up they heard all of it realising they heard me i sat down on the tatami with my shoulders down i really havent thought about buchous feelings that much huh akenosan sat next to me and speaks yes that is true you also havent taken concerns about me asiachan xenoviachan and konekochan who is right here as well konekochan also sat near me i started to think for a while seriously i really didnt take any concerns for the girls im always lecherous and always imagining about womens naked bodies and i always dreamed about perverted things but the truth is i really didnt think about the girls that may be true i really didnt try to understand the heart of a maiden if i think like that not just buchou but i also havent thought about the other girls in the group though we possibly didnt try to understand isesan as wellasias voice when i looked up asia who apparently came in without me realising it was standing there asia approached me and sat down next to me about me yes thats right thats why we thought about it rias is
important but more than that we have to heal isekun first healing me akenosan says thatwhile stripping my clothes off hohold on a sec akenosan what are you trying to do by making me naked ufufu i will suck your dragon power right here here also akenosan takes her clothes off her enormous breasts bounce akenosan then hugs me from behind the soft and tender object can be felt directly from my bacccck it feels like the blood in my whole body is going to boil because i can feel the things in the middle of her breasts touching my back i will also do the healing with the senjutsu along with it please lift me konekochan hugs me from the front she turns into catears mode inside my arms and she started releasing her senjutsu aaaah it feels like i am receiving a warm ki from konekochans small breasts and also the two soft oppai i can feel from my back is making me more chuuuuuuuu hauu i slipped a sound from my mouth i cant help it thats because akenosan is sucking on my neck and thats by moving her tongue giving me sensual pleasure thats by sucking
and licking you are willing to suck my dragons power like that thank you very muchto the front is a nekomata to the rear is the oneesama amazing things are happening in a sandwich situatioooooon iim also joining asia who started to take her clothes off takes my hand and places it on her breast my brain is about to burst with asias oppai which seems like its still growing at the same time a shallowgreen aura is emitted and it comes to me this is the power of healing its an amazing situation i have my dragon powers sucked by akenosan i receive the ki from konekochans senjutsu which makes the blood within my body better and my body gets warm with asias healing aura i became in a state where i cant take it anymore but akenosan mutters sadly to me when isekun looks at us sometimes you look at us with frightened eyes i didnt understand why at the beginning but i finally understood why frightened eyes i see so i have been making such eyes without noticing konekochan then looks up to me with teary eyes probably only those who know about that incident can only
notice it that incident yeah i realised it right away so akenosan and konekochan alsonoticed it the ones who know in detail about that incident are the group members that were already within this group when i joined inside isesans heartdeep inside your heart does raynaresama still haunt you when asia asks me very timidly a beautiful girl with black wings comes back to my mind at the same time her words come back to mewill you die for me my first girlfriend yuumachan no the fallenangel raynare that instant i started to get nasty sweat coming out from my face i got a flashback of raynares vision and words i dont want a filthy lowclass devil like you talking to me at times i wonder if its okay for me to talk to everyone here who are a bishoujo ahahaha yeah you are right it was a very royal date thanks to it i was very bored when i go shopping with buchou and others i start to wonder if they are actually bored being with me i dont want a rotten brat like you calling my name i also want to call buchou by her name isekun please
save me this devil is trying to kill me i love you i love you so much thats why lets defeat this devil together my first girlfriend begged her life to meand the woman i love killed that woman back then it was proper for raynare to be killed she did such horrible things to asia and she even killed her once thats why i think it was a proper measure for buchou to finish her off but why is it these tearswhich are dropping from my cheeks i then muttered while wiping my tears away she was my first girlfriend when i was confessed to by her i was really happy when i dated her i really did my best i did so much planning for my first date i even thought deeply about my future with her i even imagined about christmas and valentines day like an idiot and i was fantasizing all by myselfiblurted out everything i kept hidden inside me even if i tried to make it as a story in which you can laugh at i really couldnt laugh about it deep within my heart but she was actually my enemy and she killed me
she looked at me with coldeyes after i became a devil and i found out she was acting the whole time and even i was fine with that she was really evil she killed asia and i fought her i snapped i hit a girl for the first time and that happens to be my first girlfriend after that she begged for her life to me but she was killed by buchou raynare perishing the black feathers which belonged to my first girlfriend spreads within the church that scene is burned into my memories and my brain freezes every time i remember about it asia akenosan konekochanim scared im actually scared of getting along with girls because it makes me think that the same thing will happen again the girls in our group are being kind to me but if i tried to take another step and try to get along with everyone it makes me think everyone will reject me and laugh at me i know that everyone isnt bad inside my head all of you are good people but i still cant the more i tried to understand everyone the more it makes me stop ihid my face
with my hands i cant show such a pathetic face to everyone i cant show this face of mine who is still dragging the past on my back even so i told them my true feelings i dont want to tastethe same thing again i really am a pathetic guy in front of the girls i get along with despite claiming that i will become a haremking i told them the truth that i dont have the courage to get along with girls its a situation where it cant be helped if they start to hate me or lose interest in me asiagripped gently onto my hand she says it with a smileilike isesan very much i got shocked at asias words asia continues i want to stay with you forever there is no way i will talk ill about you i respect you i admire you you are the man i can depend on the most i think deeply from my heart that i want to stay with you even in the future asias smile and words reach deep into my heart there is no way riasoneesama will hate isesan i know that isesan likes riasoneesama isesan is someone
who can fight much harder than anyone for riasoneesama and not only me but everyone knows that of course oneesama should understand this too asiahas been paying attention to me very closely i thought i was the one protecting asia instead she was the one protecting me she made sure i can feel safe thats why please have courage it will definitely be okay if its isesan if its isesan who has been able to work hard until now then you will be able to break through the wall inside your heart having asia say that i started to cry shit this is just my sweat from my heart i just started sweating because i received a comfort from her hug akenosan gently hugs me from behind i also like isekun very much as well she says that while putting her face on my shoulder konekochan also says it while putting both her hands on my face me too i like you very much i think it is okay for you to forget about that fallenangel shes right if its the same fallenangel then i will be able to make isekun happy thats why please have more confidence if you
dont take another step with rias then i cant akenosan stops there but asia also says iti also asia also realised something and then shakes her head yes thats right everyone wants to get along with isesan even more all of you are too kind its melting away asia akenosan and konekochans words are melting something tangled inside me slowly why is it my heart feels warm the words i just received from these three filled the hole inside me asia akenosan konekochan i i it feels like i can get rid of raynares curse if its now the thing which has been grasping me feels like i can get rid of it now oneesama akenosan konekochan xenoviasan irinasan rossweissesan kibasan gasperkun and i all love isesan can you not believe what i akenosan and konekochan are saying asia thank you asia you really were watching over me i really am a lucky guy a kind girl like her promised me that she will stay with me forever that alone would be enough for me to get rid of raynare why couldnt i realise that till now i wiped my tears away and became emotionally stable yeah thank you if
everyone says that then that must be true asia i will promise you once again we will always be together lets stay together even tenthousands years later as well asia i also like asia as well yyes we will always be together i also like isesan very much asia says that while shedding so many tears ara im also going to stay with isekun foreverwhile pressing her breasts on my back akenosan also shows her face to me i also will stay with senpai forever konekochan says that while doing a light jab to my stomach are you perhaps a little bit angry konekosama ah xenovia come here what is it irina did you find ise irina and xenovia also show up to the door were they looking for me when xenovia sees this situation inside this room she started to think for a moment and then pounded one of her hands on her palm as if she understood the situation oh so this is a fight over ise this is surprising these things happen suddenly so i cant let my guard down on top of that today is the day where we push him down naked right leave it
to me xenovia says that and she comes towards me after taking her clothes off boldly irina you also come if you dont your childhood friend will be taken away more like i will take him away awaawawaawawawa i should join as well right im michaelsamas ace and im going a stage one rank higher by giving birth to the child of the tenryuu15 rather im also joining for the fight over isekun irina who has been persuaded by xenovia comes at me while having her wings changing colours from black and white and forth yyou guys like i say everytime fix that part where you move without any hesitatioooooooon being surrounded by five beauties and also having them battle each other in turns i also didnt know what to do now isesan is going to be with me who cares asia its just a bit yes lets do it fairly asiasan xenoviaaraara cheating your way out has the most thrill you know right konekochan there is a first come first serve as well akenosan i could just watch and laugh at the battles between the girls which they are doing at the corner of the room like i thought
there are so many parts of girls you cant understand buti really thought i was saved i was saved by the words and feelings of the girls raynare who has been living within my heart little by little its coming off even if it doesnt disappear completely compared to before and until now i think it became much lighter now thank you asia akenosan konekochan and also xenovia irina i think i will be able to have courage now no matter how it ends i will take a step for my own feelings it might not be the answer that buchou is looking for even so i no this is something i have been thinking for a long time after i defeat sairaorgsan im definitely going to confess this feeling i have i made a single decision inside my heart and the fated battle was approaching during our break i said that to kiba while munching onto the onigiri12life 3 the battle to decide who is the strongest youth begins part 1 the day of the game amazing the island really is floating in the sky i was looking at the floating island through the gondola lift which is connected
towards the city in the sky besides me are asia irina xenovia konekochan and gasper who are also looking out the window just as i am in the island floating in the sky there is a city there called agreas its said that the power which is making the island float was created in the oldmaou era but its said that only ajuka beelzebubsama knows the details about it due to that the servants of the current beelzebub are maintaining the core of this place a floating island is indeed very rare from the city the water falls to the ground just like a waterfall not just one or two falls but there are many of them falling to the ground it really is like a fantasy of course i will be fascinated by it just to be expected from the world that the devils live in the underworld it really is like a fantasy the city of the sky that is located in the agares territory it seems like they made a city on top of a floating island apparently its also a place which controls the flow of the air around this area on top of that its
a tourist resort there are three ways to enter the city one of the ways is to jump to the place directly using a magiccircle this way of entry is only permitted to the vips and also when there is a special matter its an important place and also a world treasure so they dont permit to transport there using demonicpowers as much as possible well there might be devils with ill intent that want to come and do evil deeds the second way is to use transport such as airships this is used more than the jump the third way is the method we are using and that is to use the gondola lift where the ropeline is connected from the ground to the city of the skyand we chose to use this third method after hearing the words of buchou who already knew how the view looks from the gondola lift everyone said we want to ride on it so like that we are heading towards the sky while enjoying the view from inside the gondola lift man the weather is good today its a good day to have a match so we will be having a battle
on that city of the sky huh i need to make sure i dont fall it will be embarrassing if i was to retire outside the actual battle to tell you the truth there was a dispute between the higherups on which stadium to use for this game azazelsensei says that while looking at the sky everyone looks at sensei dispute for decidingthe stadium sensei nods at my question the higherups from the current maou faction wished for the game to take place in either the gremory territory or the maou territory but then the bael faction who takes importance of the lineage protested to have it in the bael territory ssomething like that happened sensei continues the currentmaou arent part of heredity so for highclass devils who take importance in lineage and household the house of the greatking bael is an important factor which has more fame than the maou they are in the first ladder among the 72pillars the devils who were siding with the oldmaou also said that in the past and there was a dispute right why are they trying to do the same thing again when i asked sensei made a gesture using his hand
and then sighed that is that this is this something like that adults are complicated creatures both in the human world and underworld appearance and influences well it means that there are many things going on in the underworld where the noble society has many powers so it became the agares territorykonekochan mutters sensei nods yeah its said that the archduke agares came between the maou and the great king the middle manager and the one acting for the maou the archduke agares even if the era changes they are the household which always has a hard time i then remembered that nextheir sis who wore glasses shes the same age as us so it seems like she will be the one who we will get involved with in the future it seems like we will get a scolding from her everytime something happens so will our match become like a representative war between the maou lucifer and the greatking bael kiba says that while narrowing his eyes sensei also answers while stroking his chin well there are many of those who look at it in that way the oppaidragon switchprincess vs the strongest youth sairaorg is just a cover
which is just to make the attention of the common people go there on the other side the bunch from the politician will be looking at it while making comments politics so you are telling me things like that are happening behind our game so troublesome we are going to do the game because of our own ambitions when i said that sensei laughed its good that you guys stay like that that will be enough even if you guy were to lose there is no way that sirzechs would suffer politically except the guys from the house of greatking would be having a good time and also the guys behind sairaorg will also receive a good time as well there are politicians behind sairaorgsan that man who has risen up with only his body wont be influenced by the opinions of the politicians except he himself has made connections with them so they could become a support for him to aim higherto fulfill your dreams or ambitions you must get involved with politics huh if i think about it we also have connections with sirzechssama and leviathansama from their sides does it look like we have connections with politics
after all they are maou but there are things i still cant accept the highclass devils who are using sairaorgsan who went through hardship and who was born without the traits of his house huh i muttered it out from the story the ones who abandoned sairaorgsan the main person is their side the current head of house of bael the people around sairaorgsan must have been involved in it as well and they started to gather around him now huh around sairaorgsans power sensei sighed it might be complicated but its good that way just think that he finally has gathered attention after going through hardship whatever reason it is being acknowledged by someone with fame is a result whats left will depend on the result you guys dont worry about him and go at him with full strength you wont be able to defeat him if you dont use everything you have in order to accomplish your aim i know sensei we dont have the time for also worrying about sairaorgsan this is a match we are going to win in order to link it to our dream but will the greatking faction acknowledge sairaorg baels dream he
is wishing for the underworld where devils can surpass their social status if they have powers so they can make their wish come true correct kiba asks sensei like that like he said did the baelfaction came into contact with sairaorgsan while knowing his dream do you think the greatking faction who is still obsessed with being the former first ladder of the 72 pillars and who takes importance of the household will allow that they are saying they will cooperate with him on the outside but on the inside they are despising him what those guys want are pawns that can be used to retaliate against the maou to them the pure believers that gather around sairaorg will just be like a tool tothem which can support their backs in the political issues sairaorg also realised this as well even so he made connections if it will make him go even higher he is a pure and patient man sensei answers thats a horrible story even so sairaorgsan accepted those terms for his dream i wont be able to understand how it must feel ah now i have a question i say that out it might be late but
will there be a possibility that this game will be targeted by the terrorists the hero faction there is its getting this much attention after all and many bosses of the industry will be coming if they have to target them this will be the place to them sending off their prideful balancebreaker users into the place with many people that will become a big contribution to their actions we put on maximum alert around the stadium though it will end with nothing happening sensei answers naturally so there is a chance but it will end with nothing going to happen how can you be so sure akenosan asks sensei scratches his cheek i received a personal message from vali including me everyone gets shocked of course i never thought that name will show up here vali from him i ask yeah that bastard sent me a short message like this its an important match between sairaorg from that house of bael and the gremorygroup im also looking forward to it i wont let them intervene with hyoudou issei you sure are being loved by him ise pplease stop that its freaking me outsso that bastard said something like that
that bastard sure likes to look down from a high position but the reason why it feels reassuring having vali say that means that i acknowledge his strength shit i dont know why but i feel a bit frustrated sensei continues while ignoring me who is being frustrated either way since he said that it might be certain that he has cao cao under his surveillance they also wont be willing to fight the valiteam at the cost of crushing the stadium if their opponents are the valiteam which is filled with monsters then they will receive great casualties so there is a high chance that they wont do anything where they wont get any profit i see so thats also another way to look at it huh so that makes us being protected by vali huh even though i dont quite understand i felt relieved since i can have the match safely sensei then says it while looking out through the window we can also think that maybe cao cao hasnt been targeting here from the start as well the other factions also have their guard on in their base because there is a chance that they might be
attacked if their guard is down so we are still far away from getting truepeace huh to begin with its said that our battle against them would take a while looks like there will be lots of obstacles for us in order to make our wish come true while i was thinking such things the gondola lift arrives at the city of the sky the ones who were waiting for us when we got off the lift were the groups of fans and media the moment we got off the gondola we were surrounded by shouts of joy and flashes from cameras we got onto a limousine which was stationed in the front lead by groups of bodyguards and staffs i have been waiting for you allthe one who was inside the limousine was ravel she came to the city of the sky agreas beforehand to do preparations for us this girl sure knows how to do a lot it was a crazy crowd i realised it once again but we are this popular huh when i looked back from the window inside the limousine there were cars that look like they belong to the media following after us you
guys need to get your own personal manager especially rias and ise which is a must for this match whether you win or lose your fame will rise it will calm down after days have passed but for a while it will be like this every time when you come to the underworld ah yeah ravel how about you become ises manager you will learn a lot if you stay with this guy though hes a sukebe sensei says that with a lecherous face spank akenosan slapped his head with a harisen16 wwhat was that for akeno sensei argues back with teary eyes but akenosan says it with a smiley face which has intensity in her smile ufufu it is a delicate time right now so please refrain from saying that right buchou akenosan winks at buchou buchou put on an unpleasant face while making her cheeks go red it seems like ravel also noticed this atmosphere so she didnt show much of a response buchou has gotten better quite a lot there is still stiffness when we talk but not so much that she will talk back at me it seems like from the incident a few days back
the girls lead by akenosan comforted buchouthanks to that buchou has gotten back to her usual self it must be something related to me but i wonder what akenosan and the others said to comfort her wwell i shouldnt pursue the information about it too much its just before that match and if she has gotten better then we can go forth with the game but a manager so we need someone like that huh i havent even thought about it but ravel being my manager the schedule for the group as a whole is being taken care of by grayfiasan but it seems like it will be a different story if its a schedule for me individually i cant have someone from our group do it and the only person who is a devil that i know is basically just ravel while i was thinking like that the limousine drives through the city heading towards the dome part 2 there are many amusement facilities that exist in the city of the sky among them there is a giant dome stadium that mainly does exhibitions for different types of matches and arts agreas dome we moved to the highclass hotel
which is located next to the dome stadium its luxuriously and gorgeously made after becoming a devil i sure have come to places like this quite often this happened all because i became a servant of the highclass devil gremory a spacious lobby and shiny and clean flooring there is a giant chandelier on the ceiling even so i still feel that the gremory household is more amazing well that is a castle after all we are being guided to our personal room by the bellboy the match will take place at night there is still time left so we will be here until the time for the match then there was a group coming from the other side that were emitting a weird atmosphere and a cold aura which feels like its piercing through my skinthey have their hood worn down so much that we cant see their face and they are wearing a long robe where we cant even see their feet and at the center of the group there is one wearing an outfit which looks like that of a priest wait what the heck is that i became speechless after seeing the one at the center
of the group its a skeleton a skeleton is wearing an outfit that looks like the one worn by priests on his head is a cap worn by priests as well i think its a cap called mitre and he has a staff in his hand the skeletonpriest stops after seeing us the eye socket which has no eyes shines oh well oh well if this isnt the crimsonhaired gremory and the governor of the fallenangels that voice isnt something which came from a persons mouth from where did it come from is it using something like a magic and sending its words to us hearing the words of the skeletonpriest sensei smiled sarcastically oh if this isnt the god that governs death hadesdono who lives in the lower part of the underworld the realm of the dead which is also known as the depths of hell so you have come here bringing so many grim reapers with you but i never thought you who hates devils and fallenangels more than anything to come all the way here the god of the realm of the deadhades so this skeleton is a god thats why its emitting this itching kind of
aura fafafa you sure know how to talk damn crow lately its been noisy up here so i came to observe skeleton geezer it seems like you are the only one from the greeceside who is still uncertain about the alliance between the factions and what of it will you also get rid of this old man here just like with lokiafter that conversation the group around the skeletonhades increases their killing intent are they planning to fight us here give me a break its just before an important match azazelsensei shook his head and sighed im telling you to become more openminded like the perverted geezer odin i only hear black rumours about you fafafa if the herds of crows and bats starts to make noises then even i will want to make sure i dont hear those noises what intense hostility does crow refer to the fallenangels then that makes the bat being devils right then this skeleton changes his sightsto me mme his eye socket glows welsh dragon it sure brings back memories of when you and the vanishing dragon were rampaging at the depths of hell together he knows you ddraig there was a little something
a long time ago i see so a little something happened huh its not something where his grudge will be directed to me who is the current sekiryuutei right if the opponent is a skeleton its scary because it feels like i will be cursed for real well then i will have myself enjoy today you should hope you wont die i didnt come here to take all your souls with me today after all saying just that the skeletonhades walks pasts us i wiped the sweat on my forehead and took a breath when i looked it seems like the other members were also nervous and were loosened up now i did hear about hadessama from my senior back when i was a valkyrie but it sure doesnt feel like you are still alive when it seems like he holds a grasp of your soul rossweissesan muttersyeah it felt exactly like that the feeling of our soul being looked through i see so this is what it means to govern deathis it sscary that skeletonsan had intense pressure when i said that sensei started to move around his neck as if he was stiff until now well yeah his
power is among the topclasses within the whole major faction after all is he stronger than you sensei hes stronger than me that skeletongeezer that is all of you dont turn him into your enemy definitely also hades but the grim reapers around him are creepy seriously he is a serious issue if he is stronger than sensei and sirzechssama and his escorts being grimreapers its too scary he definitely came up on the top list of people i dont want to encounter so he is an evil god then when i said that sensei shook his head no he just hates devils and fallenangels rather he hates other kinds which are from the different mythologies he is a god who confronts humans normally he is a being who is necessary in the realm of the dead but i hate him ara he just clearly hates him i also dislike him thats because the way he looks at us devils is hostile i took a breath after having a scary encounter then a lively laughter echoes throughout the corridor dehahahahahaha i have come azazel i have also come azazel gahahahaha two good build old men with moustache came and surrounded
sensei sensei also sighed with his eyes half closedso you came zeusgeezer and poseidongeezer you guys are really hard to be with like always it would have been better if hades was lively and easy to understand like these two zeus and poseidon the moustache geezer whos wearing no top poseidonsama is someone i met due to a certain case before but the moustache geezer who was wearing a crown and toga17 is someone i see for the first time i see so he is the legendary zeussama such a famous god came running towards us it sure is an amazing view it seems like these two know azazelsensei and they started picking on him arent you going to find a wife azazelbou18 being still single feels lonely doesnt it i can introduce someone there are many great women in the seaaaaaaa gahahahahaha ah you dont have to worry about unnecessary things sensei is being pushed back my first time seeing it hee so there were actually gods that sensei cant act too high to even if they are the same gods from greece as hades unlike him they are friendly i came you guys this time it was a
voice i heard before when i turned around there is a chibidragon floating in the air i dont know any chibidragons but judging from his voice that voice is that you oldman tannin you sure have become small hahaha it will be hard to move around in my original size im usually in this form at events like this so he can become this small hes adorable hes like asias familiar which is also a chibidragon oldman says it while looking at all of us the man you will be facing is said to be the strongest youth but i dont think all of you are inferior to him so go at him with all your might of course look forward to our victoryi replied to him with confidence my tension sure does rise when i meet those i know at times like this it seems like hes cheering for us today so it will be worth fighting today ah odinsama rossweissesan made a hysteric sound in the direction rossweissesan is pointing atodin the geezer was there odin the geezer shouted this is bad when he saw rossweissesan and ran away from the scene rossweissesan made a howl seeing that
you are out of your luck meeting me here waaaaaaaait this shitty geezeeeeeeeer whos that new valkyrie next to yoooooooooou rossweissesan who turned into an armoured valkyrie state went after the geezer odin who ran away ise yuuto xenovia please go and stop rossweisse buchou say that while making a sigh its right before the match but the hotel is getting livelier than i thought we get guided to our own personal waiting room rather than a room its more like a spacious floor and there are table sets so you can take a break green tea snacks and even training equipments its a place with everything available members who will be doing some exercise got changed into our jersey and have started to do some warm ups if we dont do some warm ups now then we might not be able unleash our full power for the actual match so theres still six hours until the game huh we should use the remaining time for a light exercise and to relax it happened when i thought something like that and was doing some running pardon mea single man entered the floor it was someone who we know what the
raiser oniisama buchou and ravel exclaim hysterically at the appearance of that man yeah that man was none other than raiser phoenix yo ive come look like you are also doing well ravel saying that raiser sits on the chair so raiser also came to the stadium it must be to observe our battle and hes already back on his feet at one point he hid himself in his room due to his shock at being defeated by me did he come to see how we are doing i had doubts the other members thought the same akenosan pours tea for raiser raiser says it after taking a drink i thought i would talk a bit about the match todays game has the same amount of attention as that of a popular pros match the fact is the flow of the game will basically be the same as that of a pros match even the seats are being filled with viewers you guys will be fighting under that you might feel bewildered because of the difference with the real battle where there is a thing called entertainment involved but its such a big stage like this unleashing your power alone
will contribute to your ratings rias this will be one of the crucial moments for you raiser was discussing seriously i thought he came to taunt us or something but it was the opposite as a pro and as a person who has experience he talked to us having raiser say that buchounarrows her eyes im not as good at making tactics as sona and i dont have power like sairaorg though i know im blessed with my servants thats why im irritated at myself who can not lead these children appropriately buchou declares buchou you have been thinking something like that thats right buchou is also a girleven though she acted firm she must have been facing forward to the game with anxiety hearing buchous words raiser says it you can improve your strategies and power with experience and also by doing something i hate called working hard with that you can attain some level of power but you know rias your fateful encountersyour talent to draw those with talents is different i think these guys all gathered here because of your good talent to draw people but the dragon i think its also because of ise who is
the sekiryuutei that also has to do with it it was your fate to meet the sekiryuutei the special something you have made you meet with the sekiryuutei thats why you met him even if the trait of the dragon drew the other ones after that you were the one who met sekiryuutei and made him your servant raiser said it to buchou straight have confidence rias these guys are your treasures raiser you said something good even i was moved so he wasnt just a goodlooking badboy type maybe raiser became embarrassed at what he just said so he continues while scratching his cheek i who am a pro will guarantee it you guys are already in a prolevel rather you have enough talented members for you to go in the topranks even if you guys were to fight my group again it seems like we will lose badly well that goes the same for the baelgroup they are also strong man why are the young ones of this generation filled with exceptional ones saying that he got up from the chair and started to leave rias i will be rooting for you win with raisers encouragement buchou nods
with a bright expression yes of coursebuchou it seems like you got rid of another weight again it seems like a king has to shoulder many things and also has to be troubled by it they need to shoulder the fate of all their servants and lead them to the path so thats what it means to be a highclass devil huh sekiryuutei raiser calls me raiser makes a grip with his fist and directed at me your fist its a strike i can never forget that punch is a strike you can use to aim to the top with come up here quickly to the same stage as i am if its you then you can do it right lets have a rematch there i will teach you the horror of the professionals in the world of pros yyes of course i will definitely fight you again and beat you in the official game this is my true feeling i want to have a rematch with raiser in the game properly and beat him raiser then looks at his sister ravel also i leave ravel to you shes as spoiled as rias even so shes earnest i will burn
you if you make her cry okay iits none of your business ravel responds with a red face confirming that raiser laughs at himself saying i sure have become senile and leaves the room raiser he came all the way here to encourage us thank you very much thanks to that we can go forward with the game with even spirits i thank him inside myselfbut the door opens again and raiser appears once more thats right i forgot to tell you sekiryuutei i was asked by sirzechssama to call you before he asked you to show up in the vip room it seems he wants to show you somethingsirzechssama does i tilted my head and headed towards the vip room by myself part 3 so like that i entered the vip room where sirzechssama should be at its a room which has many expensive looking household furniture its spacious and gorgeous im sorry isekun to call you before the match sirzechssama welcomes me cheerfully its okay so what is this thing you wanted to show me yes its something good that your passionate fans sent you i wanted to show it to you very much sirzechssama got the circular
looking thing from the table and put it inside what seems like a video machine for the television disk is it a video or something when i asked sirzechssama nods while turning on the monitor yes its a video letter what appeared on the monitor was a boy holding onto a toy of me when im in balancebreaker state its a homemade video the boy speaks bravely towards the camera oppai dragon hello i like oppaidragon very much i can also sing the song as well i cant go to the dome for the match but i will cheercheer for you from my house thats why please win the game this is a video letter the video changed and this time two siblings dancing around in a circle showed up oppaidragon win okay zoom zoom iyaanohyai this time its a video of a child with his parents he has a toy of me and the switchprincess in his hands i will be cheering for the oppaidragon and the switchprincess i wont be able to go there but i will be cheering for you all the time a video letter of support from the children to me they kept on changing
and many children have sent me lots of video messages i had something coming out from my eyes there arethis many children are thinking about me today the match will be broadcast live throughout the whole underworld many childrenwill be watching you through the television sirzechssama brings a box which was kept at the end of the room and he opens the box and passes a letter its a fanletter written in poor devilletters from the children to me on each of them there were poor drawings of me but you can tell they tried hard to draw me each of the drawings have passion in them and they were the one of a kind type of fanletter in this world while my hands were shaking with happiness sirzechssama says it to me these childrenare the future of the underworld for todays match there will be parts where the politics of adults will get involved but all of you dont have to worry about those kinds of things thats why i want a favour from you isekun when all of you will be fighting for your dream even a tiny bit is okay but can you please fight for these
children as well i know its a selfish wish even so i ask you i want you to protect the dreams of these children protecting the dreams of these children thats right todays game also has to do with that as well i know that very well im oppaidragon after all im hyoudou issei the current sekiryuutei im also the chichiryuutei and the oppaidragonso i will be fighting while carrying the dreams of many people huh i need to take this match with a different feeling to that of the time when i had the raisermatch and sitrimatch for myself for buchou for my comrades and for the children supporting me lets go ddraig there are many things we have to accomplish but the things we need to accomplish are simple yeah i know that partner i will conquer this game and give answers to everything part 4 with the game approaching we were waiting for the time to gather in the corridor which is connected to the entrance of the dome stadium we can feel the heat and the brightness of the stadium from across the gate at the same time we can hear the sound of the crowd
our battle costumes are the kuou academy uniforms like always but they are different from our usual uniforms they are speciallymade uniforms for this game theyre made with a higher resistance to heat cold bullets magic defence and such where the defence against many things has been improved well its not that they have an insane defence to them but theyre still much better uniforms than the usual ones xenovia is wearing her usual battle costume though its made from the same material as our uniforms rossweissesan is in her armour form apparently she feels more relaxed in it asia is also wearing her nun costume its asias battle clothes after all this one also has enhanced defence while each of us stayed on standby doing something to stay relaxed buchou speaks with seriousness in her wordseveryone the match which is about to begin isnt a real fight its a rating game but it has the same serious atmosphere as that of an actual battle it will be a fight where people will be watching over us but be careful you dont get pushed back by it now the battle of the century is about to begin from the east
gate its sairaorg baels team waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah cheers and shouts of joy could be heard even in here the dome shook heavily at the entrance of the bael group im getting nervouuuuuus its okay it is said that you will feel better if you think everyone is a pumpkin that conversation is between the nervous gasper and the calm konekochan its like their usual conversation xenoviasan is it true that irinasan will be doing cheerleading from the gremorysupporting side yeah asia that seems like it she said she will be doing the role of an oneesan from the oppai dragons fan supporting area i heard the conversation between asia and xenovia i see so irina would be doing that kind of role today huh ravel said that she was able to get a seat in the oppai dragons fan area as well so those two must be together then and finally from the west gate its rias gremorys team we were finally announced ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo the crowd is already heated up im getting nervous my heart is beating fast everyone else also changed their attitude and they have a serious expression buchou then says it while looking around all of usthank you
for following me till this far now lets go my servants lets win yes we replied back to her and we finally went through the gate being under the cheers what we witnessed in front of us isa floating land which is floating above the spacious circular stadium actually i should say that there are giant rocks floating above the spacious field on one of the rocks floating above the field the bael group was already there now will the gremory group also please go to their base the announcer says our base is on top of that whats connected to the rock base is a long snakelike stair case we also walked up the stairs just like the bael group did and we arrived on top of the base i can see the bael group from afar dont tell me its going to be a sky battle where well be using this whole field maybe something like jumping across the rocks randomly and the first one to destroy the base wins or something on the base there are chairs with the same number of people as our group and a mysterious stand and the only other thing left is
something that looks like a transfertype magic circle located one storey higher than our base when i looked the opponents base looked the same even when i looked down what appears as a marathontype track field im sure we arent going down there to have a battle by doing a marathon though hmm i wonder what kind of game it will turn out to be this time i was thinking like that by tilting my head and then i heard the announcer a superflashy man who is wearing a microphone on his ears appears on the giant monitor positioned on the stadiumhello everyone the broadcaster for this match will be i naud gamigin from the house of gamigin of the former 72 pillars who will be broadcasting to you the stadium gets filled with cheers so it comes with a broadcaster amazing so this is a professionalstyle game the arbiter for this game will be rudiger rosenkreutz a magic circle appears on the air a goodlooking guy with long silverhair dressed in full uniform appears from the magic circle mainly the women make huge cheers at his appearance rudiger rosenkreutz he is a reincarnated devil who was a former human
and an ultimateclass devil on top of that his ranking is 7th konekochan mutters a former human reincarnated devil even though hes a reincarnated devil hes an ultimateclass devil and on top of that he is a current top game ranker and hes in a singledigit rank of 7th for him to be an ultimateclass devil when he reincarnated from a human and he is also a top ranker as someone who is aiming to go to the top i admire him wait so someone like that is going to be arbiter just how showy is this match going to be but it isnt grayfiasan huh i muttered in the games we have participated in so far grayfiasan has been the arbiter until now there is no way that the house of the great king will approve it grayfiasama is from the gremory side after all akenosan says that plainly if you talk about it thats true grayfiasan is sirzechssamas queen for the great king faction who takes importance in ranks she would only be a nuisance to them there is no way that grayfiasan would do something unfair to the match but it sounds like the higherups of the
great king faction would use that and our special guest we have the governor of the fallen angels azazelsama as a commentator today hello there governor azazelthen a man who we are familiar with appears on screen we became dumbfounded and gazed at him that mansensei introduces himself by making a smile well hello there im azazel i look forward to working with you tonight sssthats senseeeeeei what is he doing he said he couldnt go to the vip room because he has a special job tonight so this is what he meant so he will be involved in the game as a commentator i didnt hear about this we didnt hear about this a single bit while we were shocked sensei was being introduced by the broadcaster governor azazel you are famous for having a good relationship with sirzechs lucifersama and also the leaders of various factions and you are also famous for being the leading expert in the research of the sacred gears for todays match having done the coaching for the rias gremory team how would you look at this game well yes personally i wonder if both teams can release their full power and saying such
and such sensei started to make comments with a smile when it calmed down after senseis introduction the camera shifts next to sensei and it showed a man with a graceful face who has grey hair and grey eyes i thought he looked like a brilliant man just with one look and we have also called another person 1st ranker of the rating game the current champion emperor diehauser belial uoooooooooooooooooooo there was an even more lively cheer than the time sensei appeared its so lively that i can feel the shaking of the stadium even over here the manthe man called emperor speaks brightlyhow are you everyone im diehauser belial today i will be doing commentary for the match between the gremory and bael i decided to burn the appearance of this man into my eyes this man is the conqueror of the game emperor champion ranked 1st i dont know why but i started to shiver its not because im scared i dont know how to explain it but its a shivering of excitement and shivering of joy its because i was able to have a look at one of my targets which wasnt clear until now the
broadcaster asks sensei and emperor it might be sudden but i would like to ask governor azazel who was the advisor for the gremory team and the champion who was the advisor for the baelteam something it will be helpful if you can tell us about where we should pay attention for both teams well yes if we talk about the gremory team then it would be the oppai dragon and the switch princess and also sensei answers the question from the broadcaster and yes i do think that the combatant sairaorg is an excellent king but more than that he has a power which makes him the strongest in his team and emperor belial also answers buchou looks at him with a serious expression through the screen diehauser belial yes that champion is buchous target in the future buchous dream is to attain the title for each game achieving that means that the last wall which will come in her way is that champion buchou put on a determined face one day i will definitely but right now i need to defeat the strong foe right in front of me or else i cant even stand at the place
where i can make my dream come trueyes shes right the battle against sairaorgsan we will put emperor belial away for now the problem is whether we can defeat that man and his group i need to change my attitude there is no way i can defeat that man while having such a restless heart when i was slapping my own face the comments continue first of all its regarding the phoenixs tear oh phoenixs tear i heard that we wouldnt know whether we can get them or not until the last minute so i wonder how it turned out buchou was also worried about it because having it and not having it will change the tactics quite a bit like all of you know because of the continuous terror by the terrorists group khaos brigade each faction has became more tensed and the importance and the prices for the tears have risen rapidly because of that we are in the situation where preparing them is difficult buuuuuuut the broadcaster points at the huge monitor what appears there are two small bottles inside an expensive looking box thanks to the kindness of the current head of phoenix who produces and
sells the tears and also because of the voices of the supporters of both team of bael and gremory have reached us its decided that each team will be given the tears for this game waaah the stadium makes a roar with that information i see so the tears will be given to us if i remember ravel also said its an important match which will heat up the underworld so i would like to somehow prepare it it will be a great help but it also means that they will also be able to revive one of their members most likely that will be their king it seems like we need to prepare to defeat sairaorg bael twice kiba says that with a serious faceyeah it seems like thats how it will turn out if they have to use it on someone then it will definitely be sairaorgsan so we have to defeat that sairaorgsan twice we somehow need to make him use the tear with minimum casualties as possible even an idiot like me knows that its impossible to make them use the tear without any casualties if our opponent is that man then the problem is who
will use it on our side fortunately we have asia who is a healer so the importance of the tear isnt that high to us compared to the bael group even so we cant look down on the effect of the tear which can heal wounds immediately and also we will be forced to use it if asia is nowhere nearby especially buchou who is the king needs to survive till the end it will be appropriate to use it on buchou when she is in danger when i was thinking like that in my head we were finally given the explanation of something i wanted to hear the most there is a special rule in this game like i thought there was a special rule we did hear that it wont be a rule which will seal our powers directly but this game has viewers involved so it seems like they will focus on the entertainment aspects of it before explaining the special rule i would like to explain the flow of this game this game wont be the type where all the team members will be running through the field but will be done in a matchstyle this
is due to keeping in mind that this will be a blitz and also because it was organised to heat up all of you the viewers even though this game is between the youths the gamestyle of this game is the same as that of a pro so it wont be the one where we run around this will be my first time at having a matchstyle my comrades also put on a serious face because of the situation they never expected if its a matchstyle we wont be able to have a teambattle then we did train for oneonone battles but also trained for a teambattle so i wonder if we can use the training results to the fullest for the matchstyle battle the explanation for the special rule continuesand now for the special rule which will determine the matches now will the kings from both sides progress towards their personal stands in their bases stand ah the stand located in our base that has been bugging me this whole time buchou and sairaorgsan who is at the opponents side of the base were urged to move to the front of the stands from the stand something comes out
the giant monitor also shows the vision of it what appeared was adie a die ive been getting shocked continuously today there is a die in front of you they will be the key for the special rule yes the rule for this rating game today is one of the major game types its the dice figure dicefigure i tilted my head in wonder by hearing a word i never heard before so its dice figure huh kiba says that and he starts to explain it to me the actual rating game has many special rules the ones we have been doing till now were quite plain ones other than the ones like this one where you use a die there are also ones where you take as many flags as you can on the field called scramble flag dice figure is the representative game for using dice so there are games like that huh it sure is helpful to know them the rating game it seems like its deeper than i thought the explanation of the rule by the broadcaster continues i will explain the dice figure so that those who dont know about it can understand it the
die prepared has sixsides like the usual die and you can roll a number from 1 to 6 with it by rolling it it will determine which pieces servants can be sent for that match the dice will determine the person being sent for the match it means that the dice will determine our fate thenthe chess in the human world has values for their chess pieces the standard value for the pawn piece is 1 and they give numeric values to the chess pieces equivalent to their strength on the chessboard and the evil pieces for the rating game also use this value standard as estimation of course there are parts when the person from the group unleashes the power higher than their potential capacities which surpasses the value of their chess pieces or the part things happen where it surpasses our assumption due to the hidden factor which ajuka beelzebubsama input into the evil pieces but we will be using the standard value for the rule of this game ah that thing huh its the values where knight equals 3 bishop is also 3 rook equals 5 and queen equals 9 when i just became a devil i
was told this by buchou but its just a mere standard there are members in our group who wont fit in that standard value such as kiba who gained the factor to become a holysword wielder after being reincarnated to a devil and gapser who reincarnated into a devil with a mutation piece first both kings will roll the die and the total value rolled will determine which combatants can be sent for example when the total value rolled is 8 then you can send combatants who will fit within that value if its pawn which has the consumption value of 1 then 8 pawns can be sent of course you can also send 1 rook with the consumption value of 5 and 1 knight with the consumption value of 3 since the total value will be 8 if it is within the value range then it is possible to send a combination of combatants from different classes also group members who have consumed several evilpieces will have the value of their total values so if its the gremoryteam then the combatant hyoudou issei the sekiryuutei who has consumed 8 pawn pieces will have the value of 8 so if
the value rolled turns out to be the maximum figure of 12 then it means we can have members go to the field within that value for the match then if that happens from our side we can send the combination of queen akenosan who has the value of 9 with one of the knight or bishop so im 8 huh thats a big number then there is a limit to who i can pair with even if the maximum figure of 12 was rolled i wont be able to pair with a rook which is just out of the value it might be better to pair up with kiba or xenovia who is a knightthen what will happen if the value rolled turns out to be the smallest number when i was questioning about that inside my head it gets explained but in both combatant rias gremorys team and combatant sairaorg baels team they dont have a piece with the standard value of 1 or 2 it means that they can send out their members only from the value 3 and larger since it will be the total values if the total values rolled turns out to be the
smallest value of 2 then we will have them roll it once again then what will happen if the servant loses and the number of members gets reduced do you have to keep on rolling it until the dice values fit with the value of one of the remaining members as the match progresses the combatants will be reduced and possibly there might be a change in the value needed for the combatants to be sent then the dice will have to be rolled until the value reaches the number where combatants from both teams can be sent to the field well that would be obvious i wonder what will happen about the kings participation which will be the most vital thing here the participation of the kings will depend on the number which has been given from the people from the judging committees estimation value beforehand of course like the usual rule the game ends immediately after the kings defeat thatwill be a problem depending on the value sairaorgsan himself will be able to come out then sairaorgsan is stronger than buchou and the strongest member in the opponents team must be their king if sairaorgsan wishes to come
out continuously depending on the dice values rolled then our chances of winning will decrease more than that what does he mean by the participation of the king will depend on the judging committees estimation value i muttered out my question its like how he explained the judging committee has given the estimation value for buchou and sairaorg bael about how much their value number will be in dice figure before hand with that it will determine the number needed for each of them to appear on field it seems like this will becalculated from the strength of the king themselves the value of their servants and also by comparing with the opponents thats why depending on the game the number changes akenosan gave me an additional explanation thank you very much akenosan i see so the judging committee will choose the chesspiece value number for buchou and sairaorgsan then now then the chesspiece value number the judging committee chose for each king is this when the broadcaster shouts that out buchou and sairaorgsans name appears on the huge monitor written in devilletters and the numbers under their names are spinning then the number appears while making a rhythmical sound
combatant sairaorg bael is 12 combatant rias gremory is 8 oooh combatant sairaorg has a higher value but instead it means that he wont be able to come out unless the maximum number is rolled so for this game sairaorgsan has a higher value than buchou huh buchous value is less than akenosans and its the same as mine but from akenosans explanation earlier the way the value is determined is different from us so it doesnt mean that the value is absolute she did say that it changes depending on the game after all i just have to fix things up during the game then since its buchou i thought she would feel bitter because her value was lower than sairaorgsan but shes calmer than i thought if i think about it since buchou is 8 if a large number comes out then she can pair up with one of the knight or bishop i should think positively by the way how we do it we can do it more effectively than sairaorgsan who can only appear by himself only when the maximum value of 12 is rolled will sairaorgsan definitely appear when the value of 12 is rolled
when i said that kiba put on a hard expression it might not be certain that sairaorgsan will appear especially in the openingwhy is that even if he wins that match his ratings might drop a bit depending on the situation a oneman team doesnt get rated high after all in this game you get rated high when you are able to use your group to the fullest but if a oneman team where the king himself does that then the media of the underworld wont stay quiet about it and it will affect the future of the king on top of that its broadcasted live and if he does that in front of this much of a crowd then his ratings will go down winning is important but it also means that how you portray yourself is also important well in this game dice figure since his value is 12 sairaorg bael wont be able to appear that easily ii see if you think like that then the official game might be quite hard so it means your future might take a turn for the worst if you also dont think about how the society will view you thats
the world of pros scary also another rule you can not send out the same combatant continuously this also goes the same for the kings roger that so we wont be able to participate again unless we take one turn off between them huh so it means that sairaorgsan wont appear continuously then even if the first value is 12 i dont think sairaorg will appear from the opening from his personality he will make his servants form a group properly for that reason they went through hard trainings but he will definitely show up as well it will depend on the total value rolled but the problem will be in which timing he will appear its certain that he is a battlemaniac so you already saw through that far buchou so the prediction between the two groups has started soon as the explanation of the rules ended huh buchou then looks at asia under this rule sending out asia by herself and also in a team will be a bad move they will mainly aim for asia since she is a healer after all it will be better for her to stay here and heal those who won the
match this is one of the advantages for us since we can heal without using phoenixs tear im sorry asia i cant send you in to the match so please heal the ones who return back here that is also an important role for this gameyes oneesama i will stay here and heal everyones wounds thats why please return safely everyone of course we answered together at asias encouragement rather it seems like buchous rating will get lower if she sends out asia instead they must have read through that asiasan wont appear kiba says that and buchou nods yes so that makes it that we have 8 combatants eight people thats okay by having asia stay back it gives me more courage because i can go serious wwell i dont want to do anything reckless though even asia and phoenix tears wont be able to replenish my stamina after all now the game is about to begin both teams are you ready the broadcaster raised the tension and the arbiter raised his hand high now the rating game between sairaorg baels team and rias gremorys team will begin game start along with the sound of the start for the
game the cheer from the crowd echoes throughout the stadium finally the game began part 5 so then will the two kings step in front of the stand being urged by the arbiter buchou and sairaorgsan stand in front of the stand we will start the first match we will choose the combatants who will be appearing will both of you hold the dice buchou holds the dieim getting nervous what value will come up whether its a small or big number i wont be able to predict before the value actually comes up shoot after the arbiters call both of them roll the dice dice are rolling on top of the stands and the motion stops the monitor shows the image of the two die and the values are the value combatant rias gremory rolled is2 on the other hand the value combatant sairaorg bael rolled is 1 that is a total value of 3 they will be able to send out their servants within that value in this case since the value of the pawns on both sides is large they will only be able to send out 1 knight or bishop which have values of 3 so
which members will both sides send to the field the broadcaster says it with enthusiasm wait a 3 the smallest number came up right at the beginning so things like this can occur from the opening huh the arbiter then announces you get 5 minutes of planning time so please choose the combatant who will be participating within that time also the promotion for the pawns will be available once they arrive at the field the promotion will be deactivated every time a match ends so please use promotion every time you get on the field five minutes huh like that the planning time for the gremory team began the moment it became planningtime the bases of both sides were enveloped in a mysterious barrier the soundproof barrier its used to stop our plans from leaking outside kiba says that its also to stop people outside from reading our minds so a special mark is placed onto the faces of each combatantwhen i looked at the giant monitor oo it seems like our faces are being covered by the gremorygroup magiccircle i keep getting shocked by the prostyle game we sat on the standby chairs buchou says while looking at
all of us the opponents must have predicted that we will be sending yuuto out wwhy is that i ask but the one who answered me is kiba kiba holds up his fingers which represent the numbers since the value of 3 was rolled there are only four of us who can be sent me and xenovia who are the knights and asiasan and gasperkun who are the bishops we cant send asiasan and gasperkun who are supporttypes by themselves right they are originally rearguards who show their true strength only when they pair with warriors who will become the vanguard they are the members who should be sent when a value of 6 or greater is rolled since that is the case it means that we only have the option of kiba or xenovia so the reason kiba is picked is buchou continues from where i left off xenovia is a powertype knight since she would have to battle either a knight or a bishop of the opponents team there is a high risk that she could get hit with a techniquea counter xenovia nods yeah it seems like it would be hard to win without taking any damage
but i still wont be defeated by a techniquetype buchou continues speaking after the confident xenovia but even if she were to win there is a high chance that she will reveal the specifications of exdurandal the identity of the exdurandal will be seen through if she shows even a single ability we also want to reserve it until much later in the game during midgame after rolling a large number the match will most likely turn into a fierce battle if we have to show it to them that would be the time it would be a waste to use it from the start thatswhy its yuuto the one who is able to fight in various situations while having their ability already known that would be yuuto and not xenovia shes right even if the holydemonic sword and his new technique is exposed he can still adapt to the situation instead xenovias durandalcannon which i made up and am calling has a charging time and its not that fast after its been shot so it could be stopped or dodged it seems like xenovia will consume more stamina than needed and it also seems like she will take lots
of damage muu ise did you just think that i dont use my brain or something xenovia accuses me but i just put on a smile and shook my headthe truth is i dont think you use your brain you are more reckless than me after all you started to attack without any warning in the fight against loki and also the battle in kyoto i still have to go even if they know my abilities im going kiba takes a step forward while fixing his collar dont lose from the start okay i picked on him well i dont think he will lose though i know his strength best since im his training partner i will definitely win you sure gave me the best reply with a good smile handsome the arbiter continues the five minutes are about to be over would the combatants participating in the match please make their way to the magiccircle the magiccircle is a transporttype you will be transferred to a battlefield prepared in a different dimension the match will then be fought on that battlefield the battlefield will be randomly picked from the ones already prepared until the combatants are transferred to the
different field the bases of both sides will be placed in a barrier so the bases will become invisible and that barrier will only be taken off every time a match ends i see so that magiccircle is to transfer the combatants to the battlefield a special field is already prepared in another dimension so this place wont turn into the battlefield wait neither of the bases will be able to be seen from the outside until the transfer is over konekochan says as if she were reading my mind the reason why its invisible is to prevent changing your pieceservant after seeing who will be sent from the opponents team observe and then change and seeing again and then changing again rather than the match that itself would be a problem and we are also under surveillance to prevent us from doing anything unfair while under this invisible statehmm that certainly seems troublesome so the opponents will be a secret until they are transported to the field huh and we are under surveillance huh so maybe there are cameras hidden inside this base or something more than that i wonder what she means by unfairness man there are a
bunch of things i dont know even though konekochan knows it i dont my lack of studies has finally shown up after this game ends im going to study about the various game types the reason why you wont know which combatants will be sent until they are sent to the field is probably to please the crowds as well rossweissesan says while we are having this conversation the barrier covering our base gets denser and it cuts us off from the outside area i will be going then kiba who has a microphone on his ear stands on top of the magic circle that instant the magic circle glows and kiba disappears then above the base several visions showing certain scenery appear in the sky one of them shows the crowds and in the largestsize vision scenery of an unknown place is shown its a very wide green land and kiba is there near himis an armoured knight riding on a horse which is emitting bluewhite flames oooo the combatants for the first match have appeared as you can see the field is a vast green land and this vast green land will be the stage for the first
match the ones chosen from both sides with the value of 3 are the young noble man of godspeed from the gremory team its combatant kiba yuuto princess riass knight has appeared kyaaaaaaaa kibakyuuuuuuun having been agitated by the broadcaster the women in the crowd yell happy cheerswow our handsome prince really is super popular huh shit hes taking the good position by himself i beg you so please set up a mixerparty next time and from the baelgroup before the broadcaster introduces him the armoured knight has his horse walk ahead and he takes off the mask of his helm to show his face i know that guy i did watch the video of the match against glasyalabolas hes a knight of bael group im one of the knights that serve our master sairaorg baelsama beruka furcas thats a magnificent introduction indeed furcas is the household that has a trait to rule horses buchou says their trait is a horse so thats why hes riding a horse im rias gremorysamas knight kiba yuuto nice to meet you kiba responds by introducing himself to his opponent furcas points his circularshaped lance up high i have luck being a swordsman because
i was given the opportunity to exchange swords with the infamous kiba yuutodono of the holydemonic sword by my master i also look forward to having this duel with you oh kiba responds back fearlessly governorazazel will you please explain about that horse covered in bluewhite flames the broadcaster asks sensei pale horse thats a highlevel beast which lives in the deepest part of hell cocytus its been said that famous devils and grim reapers ride on it its also said that its a horse which brings death and destruction its not an easy task to master riding on it it has a violent nature its said that it will kick to death those it doesnt like including its mastersensei thanks for the explanation my favourite horse altobraus legs are godspeed kibadono i wish for a serious fight with you furcas was already in a battle position sensei has already told us about the dangers of that horse more importantly if its combination with the rider is superb its said that the pale horses ability can be drawn up to the max the arbiter appears on the field through a magiccircle and he stands between the two combatants the first
match starts now both of them took a distance when the signal was given it started the rating game against bael has started the one who will be doing the opening match is kiba show them what youve got kibaaaaaa i challenge you let us see if the speed of altobrau and i can match you they disappeared when the blue horse made a cry fast i had the same response as kiba since i train while having kiba as my opponent my eyes are used to fast speed even still i thought they were fast thats how superb their starting dash was kiba uses his eyesno he takes a stance as if he is trying to feel the presence of his enemy then giiiin guun the sound of the metal colliding echoes kiba didnt move from the spot but he is warding off the attacks coming in fast speed he took a distance and he went towards the enemy with fast speed after feeling the presence of the enemy for quite some time giiiin guun both of them are in a state where it only looks like two moving things are colliding at very fast speeds the things which
become visible on the fieldare the sparks created when the weapons collide and the sounds of metal colliding there are deep holes created in the field due to the waves created by several swords and the charging of the lance i can only see them when they collide against each other thats it thats how fast kiba and that knight are both of them finally show themselves when they are using the lance and swords to push against each other a draw even against the legs of my altobrau you are truly frightening indeed princess riass knight furcas laughs fearlessly you also have excellent combination with your horse if i were to try to cut the horse down your lance will stop me and even if i try to take you down the horse wont allow it seems like i have to destroy your foot path kiba who said that forms an aura around his body and he made his eyes sharper that instant many holydemonic sword blades appear from the earth surrounding kiba the swords of flowers blossomed in the field maybe he will be able to stop furcass horse with this i became overjoyed but furcass horse jumps
up high that horse can run in mid air but kiba swings his holydemonic sword down without giving a moment to spare holydemonic sword of thunder flash the sky flashed and thunder comes down towards furcas the thunder taught directly by akenosan it isnt as strong as akenosans but kiba is still able to create thunder not enough furcas threw his lance up towards the sky and he survived the thunder by using the lance as a lightning rod furcas who has lost his weapon puts hishand inside the mane of his horse which is made of fire it seems like he is trying to take something out of it the mane creates a swine in the atmosphere it seems like that mane is connected to a different dimension what he got from the mane was a second lance so he still had a lance huh they have researched kiba very well he warded off all of kibas attacks kibas sword is the holydemonic sword it has the attribute of holy devils arent able to evade the fate of receiving heavy damage if they get cut with it because of that not being hit by the holydemonic sword is a
must for opponents in order to win its easier said than done to be able to pull that off without a scratch while having kiba as his opponent means that our opponent is quite formidable its a common situation that the enemy is slain when kiba makes his move but that hasnt happened yet sairaorgsans first servant sent his first servant is this strong huh even if your holydemonic sword has a deadly effect on devils furcas makes a stance hes trying to do something it wont mean a thing if it doesnt hit at the same time as he jumpedmany duplicates of furcas and his horse were created so its a phantom or a clone huh having several furcas duplicates in front of him kibahas his swords stiff and his face looks stern dont tell me he cant tell which one is the real thing if even kiba cant tell them apart then it means that the phantoms have the same presence as the real thing several furcases move randomly in fast speed and they start attacking kiba at the beginning he fended off the attacks with his swords but kiba receives damage which comes from all direction kukiba
created a second holydemonic sword and he creates a huge aura with the two swords the surrounding grasses are blown away by it but furcas dodges it and takes a distance that move was originally meant to make furcas step back furcas returns back to only himself after making the phantoms vanish kiba took a breath and put on a fearless smile i didnt want to show my trump card from the beginning but it looks like i will lose more stamina if i continue to hold back i am in no position to say things to xenovia kiba says that as if hes talking to himself is he planning to use that already no this might be the best time to use it for kiba who has less stamina than me fighting much longer would affect his legs for future matches kiba made the holydemonic sword vanish and created a holysword within his hand so he is planning on using that i confirmed my guess after seeing that kiba declares very boldly i am stronger than you this match i will eventually grasp your movement but for that i would consume a lot of stamina thinking about later fights
its better to take you down in a blitz hearing kibas declaration furcas smirks looks like you are confident in yourself certainly your talent will eventually surpass me and altobrau but i wont go down just like that for the later matches i will cut one of your limbs to take your stamina away such amazing determination hes planning to grind down our man power as much as possible yes thats why you are scary there isnt anything scarier than an opponent who is resolved imthinking of showing my other possibility kiba makes a stance with his holysword and mutters quietly balancebreakthat moment an atmosphere different from the holydemonic sword is emitting from kiba and he gets wrapped with a holy aura then several holyswords appear from the earth and at the same time strangelooking beings with armour on them are created the armoured knight things take the holyswords growing from the ground into their hands and they gather around kiba it seems like the helm of those armoured things is based on a dragon kiba becomes surrounded by armoured knights if i had to describe it he looks like a captain who is leading a knight troop seeing that
furcas gets shocked imimpossible balancebreak your balancebreak is supposed to be the sword of betrayer how can you use another balancebreak yes kibas original balancebreaker is the sword of betrayer but thats the balance breaker for the sword birth that guy also has an ability which he acquired afterwards furcas then says it as if he finally understands dont tell me that its a balancebreaker of the blade blacksmith kiba nods quietly at his words glorydrag trooper its the balance breaker of bladeblacksmith and is a subspecies you got the right answer furcassan during the kokabiel incident kiba gained the factors to become a holysword wielder from his former comrades he also received a sacred gear ability which lets him wield and create holyswords as a result he became an insane swordsman who has the sacred gear abilities of both the sword birth and the blade blacksmith jeanne from the herofaction was a possessor of a blade blacksmith and she showed us her subspecies balance breaker of it during the battle in kyoto kiba who saw that thought of this he said isekun with my irregular powers do you think i will be able to awaken another special powerafter that
i tagged along with activating his balance breaker that guy told me to seriously go at him while he was in a state wielding a holysword instead of a holydemonic sword that guy fought me in a very disadvantageous situation many times and he finally reached it and this is his socalled new technique the balance breaker of blade blacksmith except in this situation he wont be able to use his holydemonic swords he can only use the holyswords and conversely he wont be able to materialise these knight troops while he is using the holydemonic swords the trait of kibas new ability is that the users speed and techniques can be copied on to the knight troops right now it can only copy his speed but it seems like it can still grow rather than that your talent sure is marvelous that you were able to pull off something you imagined kiba im getting jealous of your talent im glad that kiba is buchous knight you really are the best to reach this stage i had to fight the sekiryuutei with just holyswords but fufufu i was truly scared i was even prepared for my death thats because isekun
came at me while intending to kill me for real though thanks to that i was able to attain a second balancebreaker you told me to do that i thought it would be rude to you my friend if i didnt even do that actually i believed that fighting while intending to kill you was my duty as your friend on another vision sensei who is a commentator puts his hand on his chin as if he finds it amusing naturally the balance breaker for the blade blacksmith is the blade knight mass which creates several armoured knights who are wielding a holysword it seems like combatant kiba was able to alter it to his taste and materialise it as a subspecies on top of that its dragon knight troops kaa kiba you really are influenced by ise it sure is a situation that adult women will get fired up about sensei says that lively stop it its disgusting but is the reason that kiba was able to attain a new technique my fault from one of the information we attained from the herofactionthey said those who get involved with sekiryuutei and hakuryuukou especially the sacred gear possessors tend to
awaken in abnormal directions hmm i dont get it while i was thinking about it kiba stands in front of furcas while taking his knight troop with him in his current situation he doesnt hold that much offensive power compared to the holydemonic swords but since he is controlling the knight troops he has manpower if those attack at the same time then furcass phantoms will furcasdono here i come kiba sprints ahead with his knight troops several of them heading towards furcas were very fast ku i cant fall here yet furcas shouts and kicking the blue horses stomach he leaps forward at the same time he creates several phantoms kibas knight troops and furcas phantoms collide giiiiiiin a single sound of metal echoes kiba and furcas exchange a single strike while having the knight troops and the phantoms disappear a moment passesand furcas gets covered with light there is a crack on his armour from his shoulder down to his stomach and there is smoke coming from his wounds possibly due to the damage from the holysword thats the light when you retire kiba caught the real furcas within the phantoms and he conquered the speed battle splendid
furcas disappears along with the light from the field after saying that at the same time the arbiter announces it combatant sairaorg baels knight retires the crowd cheered with that announcement and we were overjoyedfor the first battle the one who gained victory is us part 6 the team which dominated the first match is the gremory team now then what will happen in the next match while the broadcaster agitates the crowds kiba returns using the magic circle at the same time the barrier lightens up and we can be seen from the outside now the time for buchou to roll the dice has come again once again the two kings started to roll the die the value rolled was6 by buchou and 4 by sairaorgsan its total value of 10 this time its a big value oooo this time the total value is 10 both sides will be able to send out combatants within the value of 10 of course its a value where you can send several combatants its like what the broadcaster said its a number where you can send out a team i wonder what buchou is going with since mine and akenosans number is
large we can only go solo buchou can also go but i doubt she will do that also kiba just went before so he cant go this time since the rule forbids one from continuously being sent get healed by asia and take a rest kiba the magic circle gets covered in a barrier again and it closes itself off from the outside world the ones whom buchou picks while using the planning time are lets go with solid rossweisse and for the support koneko i will leave this to you two double rook this is a rare style rook has a value of 5 its a combination where she used the maximum value allowed understood rogerboth of them are full of spirit the rook oneesan who is a magician and a moving cannon and a loli rook who is a senjutsu user we are having these two go but i wonder whom they will send both of them are transported by the magic circle the field which appeared on the vision this time is inside a dark shrine so this time the battlefield will be inside a building there are giant pillars inside and i can see an altar
deep within the ceiling is crumbled and you can see outside through it the shrine is made similar to the one we fought diodora in its a field which brings back bad memories now for their opponents a blonde haired gentlelooking man equipped with light armour and a sword also a giant man who seems to stand 3 metres tall im one of the knights of sairaorgsama liban crocell this big one here is the rook gandoma balam we two will be your opponents a silent giant the rook gandoma balam has a good build his arms are especially huge down till his fingers his face is more like a monster than a human wasnt balam a household with a trait of having superhuman strength yeah even on the video recording gandoma balams strength was tremendous kiba answers my question hes a rook with superhuman strength it definitely feels like hes a guy who increased his speciality even further crocell one of the former 72 pillars the descendant of an extinct house konekochan mutters like that at the introduction of the opponent knight the broadcaster continues with the introductions yes combatant sairaorg baels servant combatant liban crocell is a descendant
of the now extinct house of crocell i know that the extinct household reappears in another new way vali is also a descendant of the oldmaou after allthe current government is searching for the descendants of the extinct households which became extinct due to many reasons there were households which sought to go to the human world and the highclass devils that live in the human world have a duty to look after those descendants so like this descendants still remain but it also seems like there are many of them who have very complicated issues as well so there should be a reason why a descendant from the house of crocell is following baelsairaorgsan the second match starts now the arbiter announces since the opponent is formidable i will be serious from the start as konekochan says that she covers herself in touki at the same time ears and tails appear now there are two tails this is konekochans new technique nekomatamode level 2 by using senjutsu to cover her whole body in touki she can have an explosive power for a temporary time her physical ability also increases and she wont go berserk konekochan leaps forward very fast
and she strikes at the giantsat balams face don a lively sound echoesbut it doesnt even bother balam it doesnt seem like he took any damage from the looks of it if i remember this guy has unreal defence but there is no way that konekochan will do an ordinary punch so she must have sent ki into his body which she heightened using her senjutsu even if it doesnt show any effect with a single hit she should be able to destroy his insides if she keeps on hitting him ngh balam swings his massive arm to the side i can tell that it vibrated the air even through the vision konekochan dodges that immediately and from behind her rossweissesan shoots out magical attacks at balams bodyit was many attacks shot at the same time which include various attributes such as fire lightning ice and wind butit doesnt seem like balam has any visible damage his magical defence is also high i dont know why but ive been fighting opponents of this type lately rossweissesan must be referring to heracles whom she fought back in kyoto his defence was also insanely high zuuuuuun then rossweissesan and her surroundings blurred
is it just a bad camera vision thats what i thought but rossweissesan fell to her knees crack at the same time the floor around rossweissesan starts to dent as if its being pushed down by something there is some pressure pushing down on it i see its that guy on the video we watched that guy had an ability like that the knight crocell you have too many openings sister crocell says that while his eyes glow ability of gravity rossweissesan tries to activate a magiccircle under her foot while under the gravity i wont let you i will also freeze you crocell activates a magiccircle in his hand and ice was formed on rossweissesans feet the ice wraps around rossweissesans legs if i remember correctly you are a magic swordsman rossweissesan smiles fearlessly at crocell who is charging at her with his sword drawn im a crocell plus a mage and a mixblood who has human blood running through me add to that im good at swordsmanship and one more thing the power of gravity is my sacred gear gravity jailhis sacred gear causes gravity changes to the place he looks his ability will continue until he has
you out of his sight be careful buchou says that to rossweissesan through the earphone his ability is similar to gaspers ability its not like it stops time but its enough to stop the movement of his opponents next to them konekochan was dodging balams attack swiftly and she was giving him senjutsu punches one by one uwaa he swings his thick arm around so much that giantsan i know ive already been told about crocells sacred gear ability from governorazazel also an ability which uses sight has a weakness which is very easy to exploit even though shes under the gravity rossweissesan activates a magiccircle with her trembling hands flash a flash lightens the surroundings you are too nave sister mirror a mirror appears from the magiccircle which is in crocells hand and he tries to block the light due to the characteristics of my ability i have powers to cover those weaknesses thats why i have summoned a mirror crocell smirks rossweissesans attack was seen through no that isnt it rossweissesan made the magiccircle under her foot glow stronger the flash which was reflected by the mirrorhits balam that instant rossweissesan and balam glowed and the lights envelop
the surroundings when the light stopped the one under crocells gravity was balam rossweissesan was at balams location now instead terrific a magic to swap each others locations having the mirror reflect that magic was just a requirement for its activation its a swap done where she already read through the opponents next step kiba gave applause to rossweissesans superb attack im also shocked i seeso the opponent already had a countermeasure for when the enemy would try to blind his eyes from the beginning so she used that insteadkonekosan has your attack gone through yes i disrupted that huge mans aura and insides so his defence against magic wont be active now roger that fullburst eat this both of you rossweissesan created many magiccircles in front of her this is rossweissesans special dooooooooooooooooooooooon magical attacks with mixed attributes fall on crocell and balam the number of them isactually its dumb to even start counting them now its an attack which seems like it will destroy the battlefield the attack stops and waste spreads around the surroundings when that calms down the one who was on the ground wascrocell only crocell where is balam it happened when i was thinking
about that ive been telling yousince before that you have you guards downremember the moment youthink you defeated your enemy thats when it creates an opening crocell who is in a critical situation has his eyes glow mysteriously then rossweisssan and konekochans movements get stopped for a moment by the gravity and the one who appeared is balam covered in wounds and blood ngggggggh buuuuuuuuuuun along with the sound of the wind a massive fist which seems like its his last attack hits konekochan i closed my eyes when i saw that scene crocell balam and konekochan start becoming covered in the light for when you retire konekosanrossweissesan takes hold of konekochan konekochan has a battered body because of receiving a deadly strike from the giant im glad if rossweissesan is still active gremory can still fight even though you can tell that she has serious injuries just by looking konekochan was smiling her smile seems like she is satisfied im sorry konekochan please dont apologise rossweissesan im glad i was able to become usefulsince we were able defeat the two of them saying that konekochan crocell and balam were covered in light for transportation konekochan you did well leave
the rest to us i bit my lip and kept my anger and sadness inside me not yet dont release it yet this feeling its still too early to release it combatant sairaorg baels knight and rook combatant rias gremorys rook retire the arbiter announces the second match even though we were able to dominate itwe finally had a casualty part 7 with the second match finished the bael side had 3 members and the gremory side had 1 member retire gremory is in the lead but we dont know the outcome yet the game has just begun the broadcaster says you sure are calm you didnt let any emotion out even when konekochan was defeated kiba says i am frustrated but i thought i should hold it in isnt it better to let it explode afterwards hearing that kiba made a small laugh you sure are scary but i agree with that opinionyou shouldnt say that with a scary face geez looks like we are both sweet on our juniors now for the third match i wonder what kind of number will appear both kings rolled the dice the total value is 8 oh its a value where i
can show up it happened when we were about to go into the planning time sairaorgsan told the arbiter we will be sending the bishop corianna andrealphus sairaorgsan declared it before sending his combatant to the battlefield the crowd gets noisy the opponent bishop appears on monitor if i remember corianna is what i remembered was right on the mark a person steps forward from the enemy base like i thought its a beautiful oneesan a blond with long curly hair shes the oneesan that looks like a business woman who seems like she can handle any job on top of that she is glamorous is this a declaration combatant sairaorg what is your reason for saying that the broadcaster asks sairaorgsan looks at me mme how would hyodou issei respond if i say that she has a technique which can oppose hyoudou isseis lecherous techniques sairaorgsan says it like that a technique which can oppose my attacks the crowd gets noisy the one who answered back first to that declaration was sensei who is the commentator hou thats an interesting declaration combatant ise shows unequalled power against women the reasons are basically because of dress break and bilingual and
combatant hyodou issei is very interesting from what ive heard he comes up with new techniques every timeit seems like the emperor is also very interested in it its an honour but its also embarrassing that guy has a sponge like brain so his absorbing rate is good his head is like a very dry sponge to begin with so he absorbs everything he is taught right away i never thought it was this terrifying for his head to be this empty because he doesnt have anything but lecherous things in his head ahahahahahaha the stadium stirs with senseis comments everyone was laughing their ass off its so embarrassing im sorry for being an idiot and lecherous thats right just like you said my head is a sponge sponge dragon one of the crowd members shouted out like that what the heck is thaaaaaaaat shut up who said that someone just called me spongedragon dont put whatever you want before the word dragon after i said that the crowd just laughed even more fine then i will accept the challenge i accepted the challenge with the flow buchou puts her hand on her forehead and she seems troubled geez its
definitely a trap but how about it in terms of strength you are overwhelmingly stronger but the opponent is definitely up to something i get asked by buchou im interested in it a woman who can oppose my techniques and this is also a challenge from sairaorgsan its like hes saying can you overcome this do you think there will be any dirty tricks yeah i think what sairaorgsan said are honest words its just a straightforward challenge to me i only talked to him for a bit but i can tell that he wouldnt do anything underhanded like set a trap after making such a declaration i dont know why maybe its because we have similar fighting stylesand i certainly am looking forward to it for there to be a technique that can overcome my dress break and bilingual what can a single woman do to the lecherous me i want to experience it after all my bilingual is allowed in this game thanks to sairaorgsans kindness buchou breathed out go then im also anxious about the opponents technique which can overcome your techniques but do not let your guard down yes hyoudou issei will be going then i
did a bow and headed towards the transfertype magic circle it seems like oppaidragon will be fighting the broadcaster shouts then oppai oppai oppai the seats with children started to get heated up more than ever before please take a look the energetic smiles of those children the hero of the underworld the children are getting excited by the entrance of the oppaidragon its just like the broadcaster said amazing the faces of the children shown from the monitor have smiles on they were calling out my name as hard as they could maybe its because the invisibility barrier isnt on the monitor is showing my appearance and there was a display under my name which reads oppai dragon and as my entrance song the oppai dragons song is played so i have my personal music but this this match i cant afford to lose having that strong feeling inside me i get transported to the battlefield the light for the transportation stopped and the place i arrived at was a huge flower garden flowers with rich colours are blossoming through this whole place i can smell the scent of different flowers for a flower garden like this to become
the place for my battlefieldi then confirmed my opponent in front of me its the bishop woman she excels in all categories of demonicpowers if i remember correct but shes more like a supporttype so what will she do i put my alert on and the arbiter comes in it seems like he transferred here the third match starts now it has started i will make my gauntlet appear and promote to queen well thanks to attaining triana i am able to do promotion without buchous authorisation i started the countdown for the balance breaker while heading forward the opponent also did the same and she started to release attacks with her demonicpowers she released spear like things created from ice using her demonicpowers i started to dodge them you are pretty good boy the opponent bishop says that plainly hmm even though her voice was plain i sensed some ero inside her voice i dodged the demonicpower ice spears i also dodged her other attacks using her demonicpowers my biggest weakness is the state im in before i get into balancebreaker but that doesnt mean i dont have the countermeasure for it i train daily so i can run
around for a while in this state while i was running around the flower garden dodging the attacks my countdown ended yeah this is where the real match starts balance break a red light comes out from the gauntlet which envelops my body the red aura shapes into armour and the balance break is completed it came out its the oppai dragon in the stadium the children have gotten even more excited the broadcaster shouts the vision also appears above the battlefield and it shows the children on it oppai dragooooooooooon do your best its the best cheer there is im getting pumped with motivation well then lets see if you really can break my techniques theni increased the imagination in my head and i got ready to do bilingual i will activate that mysterious dimension then i will have the oneesans breasts speak after that i will use dress break on her when i approach her after feeding my eyes with her nudity i will defeat her immediately this is it this is the only way come come come spread my i released the demonicpower in my brain and it happened when i was about to activate bilingual strip
the oneesan started to unbutton her clothes in front of me i had my eyes glued to her stripping im staring at her fffffffor reaaaaaaaal shes striping her clothes in this place and situation oneesan didnt pay attention to my shock and she took off her business jacket i thought she took her jacket off to become serious but it wasnt the case oneesan is also trying to take off her skirt impossible shes stripping in this important battle something like that can happen i stopped my attackat this wonderful situation ooo this is coriana andrealphus of the bael team started to strip all of a sudden the male viewers are just glaring at her silently governorazazel what is this sensei is also staring at her yeah this is truly a happy situation but that is that and this is this i activated my bilingual while i couldnt hide my excitement bilingualan unknown dimension was activated and spread oneesan was within my range yeah the technique worked perfectly i will listen to it the voice of your breasts that is hey the oppai over there what are you going to do next when i asked oneesans breasts mutter so only
i can hear it nextim going take off the buttons of my blouse one by one hearing that i payed attention to oneesans movements right now shes taking off the buttons on her blouse so wonderful no how can this be the things her breasts told me isthe next thing she will be stripping off impossible something like this is possible ise what are you doing you heard what her breasts said right then prepare for the next attack i received the order from buchou bbut buchou ii i cant because her oppai is telling me what shes going to strip next impossible her breasts told you that buchou was astonished by this revelation then you can just use your dragonshot to finish the match buchou gives me another order but i cried out i cant do that buchou becausebecause its impossible for me to attack this oneesan who is stripping her clothes the option of using dressbreak to make her naked is also out of the question because i cant do that to the oneesan who is stripping for me yeah thats exactly it the action to take her clothes of one by one that alone is a godly
situation and its nonsense to strip her by force with it the woman is stripping off for me by herself this is definitely the best situation there isthis feeling only guys can understand this sensei explains so this is what sairaorgs team came up with to seal ises techniques what a frightening technique her breasts tells him what shes going to take off next while she is stripping right in front of him for guys the best situation is when a woman is taking her clothes off one by one guys are creatures that get addicted to woman stripping thats why a stripshow exists using dressbreak to strip her naked immediately is a foolish idea a move which is precise and accurate by knowing the hearts of lechers is this how powerful the bael group is i understand i can understand that sensei i know that feeling so much that it pains me though right about now the girls are looking at me with their eyes half closed while making a sigh but this is something only a guy can understand so this is the plan sairaorgsan and his group came up with magnificent its so magnificent that tears are
flowing from my eyes thank you very much so this is the weakness of dress break and bilingual i didnt see that coming since its a sukebetechnique they can find the solution for it by understanding the heart of a sukebe i trembled with fear due to the depths of a rating game you are the worst it feels like konekochan said that no maybe she muttered that out while she is looking at this through the infirmary oneesans beautiful legs her enormous breasts which is held back by her bra her hips her erotic underwear magnificent its perfect i have no more words left finally oneesan only has her bra and panties on by the way its about this stripshow but we will put a special effect on the broadcast since children are also looking i see that way the children in the stadium and back at home can watch it safelynow oneesan what will you take off next well since she came this far she will be taking off her bra and revealing her enormous ooooppai i was gazing at her with perverted eyes but oneesan puts her hand on her panties it was exactly that moment something
inside me cooled down its wrong thats wrong oneesan my intense feeling increases inside me this feeling is something you call a rage she came this far and shes taking off her panties panties bra that isnt righhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht i shouted it out inside myself you take off the bra then the panties boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost by the time i realised it i released an enormous dragonshot created from my anger towards the bishop eh you must be joking kyaaaaaaaaa maybe she didnt see that coming so oneesan disappears inside the dragonshot combatant sairaorgs bishop retires emotionless words come from the arbiter even though i won i looked up at the sky what a sad victory but i want you to understand it im one who prefers to have the bra taken off then the pantiesfor the third match i attained victory due to the differences in our sexual preferences part 8 that was a horrible match the first words i received were those from kiba the bastard was making a bitter smile shut up right now im depressed for my two invincible attacks against women to have such a
weakness and that you see the panties bra that is wrong well lets leave this conversation and move on to the dice roll the total value is announced the number is8 8 again its a value where i can come out but i cant go repeatedly 8 huh i will go then xenovia took a step forward xenovia who is a knight has a value of 3 so she can obviously participate yes you are right its about time i should leave this to xenovia buchou also agreed to it but there are still 5 values remaining buchou then looks at kiba and rossweissesan it might be appropriate for kiba or rossweisse to go with xenovia yeah if its kiba who is a knight with the value of 3 or rossweissesan who is a rook with the value of 5 then that would be within the value range of 8 and they would be able to go to the field they also might make a good pair butthere is someone who has his hand up its gasper ii will go uummm its almost the midgameso we wont know what will happenand since yuutosenpai and rossweissesan are strong i think we
should reserve them for much later everyone opened their eyes wide at gaspers words no one predicted that gasper would say such a thing himselfbut its like this guy said it would be better to keep kiba and rossweissesan who are strong for much later i think there is also a method where we send out powerful members during the midgame though but gaspers eyes were filled with determination buchou then smiles then gasper will you support xenovia i want you to support xenovia using your evileyes and vampire powers having buchou say that gasper mutters iim a boy so i need to take revenge for konekochan he said that while his whole body was trembling thats good spirit yup im depending on you gasper yyes xenoviasenpai it was the birth of the tag team of xenovia and gasper for the fourth match the battlefield the two of them arrived in is a wasteland which has rough rocks around everywhere its a place where the footing seems terrible im glad xenovia is more of a powertype despite being a knight if it was kiba instead it would have affected his speed then their opponents appear in front of the two
of them beautiful young boyemm i think the tall lanky one was a rook and the boy with the creepy looking staff is a bishop from the gremory team its the combatant xenovia the knight who wields the legendary durandal and the combatant gasper the bishop who is a girl born from a man who is popular amongst a certain group of people uoooooooooooo gyakun just like the broadcaster said there are male fans from a certain group of the crowd who gave their cheers to gasper hmm so hes popular amongst those kind of people huh i sure cant take gyasuke lightlyand it seems like there are more women fans than guys for xenovia maybe female knights tend to gather more support from the women from the baelteam it is oh my this is very astonishing since both of them are descendants from extinct households combatant ludora bune the rook and combatant misteeta sabnock the bishop both of them are descended from now extinct households of the former 72 pillars governorazazel it seems like there are several of those who come from extinct households on the baelteam sensei answers after being asked by the broadcaster if they have potential
he will take in anyone from any background thats the way sairaorg bael thinks it means that the descendants of the extinct households responded to that call even though the descendants of the extinct households are under the protection of the current government the reality is that they are being despised by a group of higherups there are many among the devils who value the importance of pure blood so much that they want to make those who survived by mixing blood with different races as if they never existed from the beginning sensei made a serious comment like that even the broadcaster looked troubled by senseis words hahahaha that is definitely true though emperor belial was laughing then the tall lanky man speaks that is correct our master sairaorgsama welcomed our clans who survived by means of breeding with humans sairaorgsamas dream is our dream it seems like the boy also has a strong belief it seems like both servants from the bael side have their eyes burning with a sense of purpose the fourth battle starts now the arbiter gives the signal for the start of the match then both sides take stances immediately and start their attacks
gasper transform into a bat xenovia you attack after thatbuchou gives an order from the base gasper transforms into several bats which spread throughout the field and xenovia released many pulses created from durandal towards the enemy rook and bishop the sharp waves from the holysword fly ahead while gouging deeply through the rocks both of them dodge the attack and the bishop sabnock releases a hot fire created from demonicpowers if i remember that bishop also specialises in demonicpowers i wont let you the bats which are flying around the field have their eyes glowing red and it freezes the fire the frozen fires remain up in the air and xenovia creates a wave from her holysword which wipes the enemys attack away good combination it was worth practising for a team battle after all ladora i received an order from sairaorgsama we will take down the swordswoman first i will prepare for it roger receiving sairaorgsans order the bishop took a step back and has aura running through his body an ominous aura is rising from him its an ominous aura which gives me the creeps and the rook steps in front of the bishop as if protecting
him and he took off his clothes if i remember correctly that rook has very high defense is he trying to become a wall thats what i thought but bon don the rooks tall lanky body suddenly buffed and it becomes an abnormal shape build up no it isnt the tall lanky body gets even more buffed and now a tail and wings have started to grow from his back his mouth is covered with fangs and his nails get sharper the bael rook is getting bigger gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaona giant black creature makes a howl a dragon appears in front of xenovia and gasper that tall lanky rook turned into a dragon even though bune is a devil its a clan which rules dragons but only a small group of people in their clan can transform and he happens to be one of them buchou puts on a bitter expression a devil which can turn into a dragon there were things like that even in fantasy stories but when i see it with my eyes for real it has so much intensity more than that i didnt see that ability in the match against glasyalabolas its my first time seeing it
so we happened to encounter someone who was able to use that ability which is rare in his clan there wasnt any information about him transforming into a dragon that sairaorg he trained that servant and made him awaken it sensei made a comment like that so he trained until he was able to transform then the battle between the dragon and xenovia began xenovia used both the wave and direct attacks with her holysword on the dragon but because of its hard defence she cant give a decisive blow the durandalcannon might be able to cause it damage but that needs quite some time for charging gasper i will take that down buy me some time xenovia asks for support from gasper so shes planning to use it xenovia stepped back and gaspers bats surround the dragon aye aye gasper covered around the dragon and tried to make it get away from xenovia buchou will gasper power up if he drinks that dragons bloodthats my opinion we have him carry my blood just in case but i thought he might be able to power up by biting it since he is already covering around him buchou shook her head
we dont know what the blood of bune will do to gasper he might get something better than we expected but its also possible for the opposite to happen having him drink your blood that we gave him will be more safe and accurate well thats true if he gets a stomach ache by drinking that dragons blood he wont be able to participate in the match the dragon which is finding the attacks of the bats bothersome breathes out a huge fire but gasper dodges it magnificently xenovia raised her exdurandal up high it happened when she was about to charge it the opponent bishop shouts this is it holysword seal your power that moment the bishops staff gave a mysterious glow and it captured xenovia xenovia gets surrounded by the creepy light then disgusting looking marks appear on her body xenovias hand trembles she drops her exdurandal what is this durandal isnt responding wwhat i became shocked at the phenomenon that occurred to xenovias body so the holysword isnt responding to her xenovia is a natural born holysword wielder that factordisappeared baels bishop then says it with a tired expression i also carry human blood within me sacred
gear trick vanish its a cursed ability that i recently became able to use sacred gear and he became able to use it recently thats why even though we watched that video i am seeing this for the first time is that also the result of their trainingtrick vanish its a sacred gear which can completely seal the ability of a specific person temporarily by consuming a large amount of the possessors stamina and mind it seems like the bael bishop sealed the ability of combatant xenovia to wield the holysword temporarily in exchange for his power sensei says that like i thought he took away xenovias ability to wield the holysword as a payment the opponent consumed his stamina and such and now he looks tired ku xenovia is carrying durandal as if she finds it heavy so it isnt working at all i actually tried to give damage to her from the aftershock created by sealing the holysword it seems like her talent as a holysword wielder is denser than i thought the opponent bishop smirks while being wobbly so xenovia isnt able to use durandal but she didnt receive the damage from the aftershock of sealing her
ability goooooon then the dragon came to attack without any mercy xenovia couldnt do anything but many bats wrap around xenovia doooon the dragon stomps on the ground where she was but there is no one under it xenovia who was covered by the bats gets moved behind the rocks so gasper evacuated her nice support im sorry gasper but looks like i will be useless now xenovia says that apologetically nno you are wrong xenoviasenpai will be more useful to buchou than me gasper encourages xenovia and he removes a small bottle and chalks from his pochetteii know a couple of ways to remove curses like this gasper activates a small magic circle in his palm and places it on xenovias body it seems like he is checking the curse on xenovia through the magiccircle i wont let you get away where are you the dragon is looking for xenovia and gasper in the rocky area while making the earth rumble its only a matter of time until they are found gasper does it look like xenovias curse can be removed buchou asks yes it seems like i can manage it with my own way of uncursing it with
the items i currently have after gasper says that he uses the chalk to draw a magiccircle having xenovia in the center he draws an unfamiliar symbol and he holds the small bottle in his hand at the end its the small bottle with my blood in it that is an item which increases gaspers power by mixing isesenpais blood with the magiccircle i just drew i think i can uncurse it but it seems like it will take some time for it to be removed gasper says that to xenovia so hes going to use my blood wwait gasper if you use that blood you will to the confused looking xenovia gasper showed a big smile xenoviasenpai i found out what my duty is gasper xenovia questions him gasper who has completed the magiccircle leaps out from the rocks ii will buy time once the curse is removed please continue to charge the durandal is he trying to charge ahead by himself without drinking my blood its reckless gasper hide yourselfbuchou shouts but gasper runs forward with a determined expression no ii have to buy some time for buchou to win xenoviasenpai is needed buchou shouts again im telling
you run away immediately the dragon and baels bishop come in front of gasper ive found you vampire so you hid that swordswoman i see but shes somewhere nearby right she will appear if i spread my flames around here having the dragon approach him gaspers body is trembling but he shows no signs of running away and he made a stance to shoot demonicpower by putting his hand forward ii wont let you go berserk is he trying to charge forward in order to protect xenovia coming ahead by yourself huh i respect that courage of yours though you are shaking you cant stand in front of a dragon without any courage the dragon who gave his respect to gasperbreathed out a flame from his mouth gobaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan gasper tries to defend it by using a defence magiccircle run away its reckless but gasper continues to act as a shield for xenovia so he can buy some time uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah gasper screams having the defence magiccircle destroyed he gets pushed back by the flames even though he gets burned by the flames gasper stands up weakly not yet i can still continue gasper dont over do it xenovias voicethe swordswoman voice
shes nearby that swordswoman where is she hearing xenovias voice the dragon looks around aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah gasper spreads his devil wings and he grabs onto the dragons arm let go unlike you whom i can beat anytime i have to take down the durandal wielder immediately that curse is temporary after all gasper gets caught by the dragons other hand and he gets crushed very strongly by it a disturbing sound echoes through the field uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa gasper screams in agony buchou looks away from that scene please stop asia covers her face and screams the dragon throws down the crushed gasper gasper is still trying to stand despite having intense pain to the point where he can barely breath now even in that situationhe is going towards the dragon it hurtsit hurts but im a boy from the gremory group please hold on xenoviasenpai xenovia doesnt respond to gaspers call she should have heard gaspers shout on the vision xenovia killed her presence and her voice probably because she understood her juniors determination her eyes are covered with her tears you are in the way gasper gets kicked around by the dragon even so he doesnt give up gremory groups maleslesson
1a man has to protect a girlhe somehow lifts his body which is trembling due to the shock and painand gasper stood up those are the words i told gasper back in the clubroom ggremory groups maleslesson 2a man has to stand upno matter what he tries to activate another magiccircle on his hand but bang baels bishop carrying a staff came while being wobbly and used his staff to hit gasper from the side give up you wont be able to beat us heartless words even a strike from the wobbling guy would be like a deadly attack to the current gasper even after hearing that he grabbed onto the rocks and he tried to stand up again gremorygroupsmaleslesson3 gasper faces forward with his swelled up face and he mutters to himself dont give upno matter what i have to protectxenoviasenpai stomp a heartless attack the dragon stomps gasper without any mercy the dragon removes his foot gasper was already battered and squashed he is no longer in a state where he can fight he will be retiring soon i trembled at the scene i am witnessing thats because gasper who is in a critical situation moved his body
a bit and he tries to move from that spot i am from the gremory i have tomake buchouwin seeing that a tear dropped down from my cheekgasssssssssssper xenovias scream echoes throughout the battlefield because she felt the shock on the earth of gasper being stomped senpai will i also be able to become useful for everyone idiot you idiot idiot you are following throughwhat i told you very stubbornly there is no one who will call you useless after seeing you right now youyou are you are a fine man from the gremory group buchou faces away from the vision i told buchou while not holding back my tears buchou i ask you please look while not facing backwards hes fighting that hard for you while preparing for death right now he is fighting harder than everyone when he was just a hikikomori and a scaredy cat before so please watch over him buchou was about to shed her tears at my argument but she holds it in and looks forward i understand im sorry ise gasper buchou acts strong asia and akenosan are crying rossweissesan also has some tears in her eyes and kiba is biting his lip
so hard that blood is dripping from it you can still move huh that strong will towards victory it really shocks me attacking anymore than this will be cruel very well i will make you better with this last attack when the dragon was about to breathe out flames i wont let you xenovia shows herself while emitting enormous aura the holy aura running through durandal its so strong that it gives me chillsand the cursed marks on her body are gone it seems like the removal of the curse was a success xenovia approached gasper and she held her junior who had already lost conscious you did well gasper you are a man im sorry because i was worthless i made you go through this xenovia apologises to gasper while shedding tears so the curse was removed the baels bishop points his staff at xenovia the dragon also has his wings spread xenovia got up quietly and mutters i was lacking it she slides the exdurandal from the sheath and changed it to the attackform i lacked determination i was caught by an attack like that i lacked resolution unlike gasper for placing my life on the line for
my masterbuchou and my comrades this guy was standing here with stronger resolution than me im ashamed of myself i just cant forgive myself xenovias words also pain me yeah we should have more determination but we are still lacking it and gasper told us that by using his body then what should i do how can i give my answer to this guy xenovia wipes her tears while saying curse like words yeah this is the only thing i can do im sorry gasper at least let me defeat these guys for you i think thats my answer towards you gooooooooooooooooon the pillar of holy light goes high up the sky thats the enormous aura created from the exdurandal even a highclass devil wont be able to endure if they get hit by iti wont let you this time i will sacrifice my life to seal that swordswomans ability the baels bishop makes a stance with his staff and he tried to activate his sacred gearbut his body froze along with his consciousness the dragon looks at gasper even though he is surrounded by the light for retiring he has his eyes glow red despite losing his consciousness gasper
stopped the opponent bishop the evil eyes that freeze time impossible the dragon shouts xenovia swings durandal up high you guys lost to gasper xenovia who said that swings exdurandal towards the dragon and the bishop zabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan a huge amount of holy aura devours both the opponents combatants sairaorg baels rook and bishop and combatant rias gremorys bishop retire the arbiter announces the end of the fourth match we have lost our two juniors by the end of the fourth match the two juniors we had to protect fought harder than us konekochan gasper i promise you both we will definitely win definitely we will definitely bring victory for buchou thats why i want you to rest you did well my juniors konekochan gasper i will definitely repay this debt to our opponents a tall lanky man and a bishoujo carrying a staff with a creepy design no if i remember that is a bishounen19king what do i mean by lets win i rias gremory realised how naive i was the ones who were the most prepared were these children these children were standing here while risking their lives from the beginning for their comrades and for me and to
win im such a worthless king im such a weak and a very horrible master thats why i will also prepare myself even if i get covered in mud even if i have to crawl on the ground i will promise to conquer this gamelife 4 as a servant of rias gremory part 1 the fourth match ended and there are seven members left in our team that is buchou akenosan kiba xenovia asia rossweissesan and me on the opponents side they consist of their king sairaorgsan queen and masked pawn in terms of numbers we are overwhelmingly at an advantage now the game might have went past the midgame combatant sairaorg baels team has 3 members left while the combatant rias gremorys team has 7 members left gremoryteam are at advantage but the remaining members of the baelteam are powerful will they be able to wrap it up the broadcaster stirs the stadium kiba the opponent pawn consumed 7 pieces right i try to get a confirmation from kiba kiba nods yeah but its creepy though i think there is no doubt that he is stronger than the members of the bael group who have shown up until now
yeah i dont know when he will show up but we should be on alert then the dice roll of the kings to determine the combatants of the fifth match began because there are only few members in sairaorgsans team they had to reroll it several times due to the value being small after several rolls the total value which showed up was 9 from our side anyone can go actually its a value where the queen can go ahead their side now has only 3 members if its 9 then only their queen or pawn can show up though i dont think the pawn would be showing up buchou says thatdo you have a reason for that i ask i feel that sairaorg doesnt want to use that pawn as much as possible there isnt even a slight indication that hes coming out even if hes keeping him for later hes keeping him back too long there were several times where that pawn was able to show up and i even thought he might send it during the second match against koneko and rossweisse buchou tells me like that the second match thats when the total value was 10
that pawn could have paired with one of their knight or bishop for that match so thats why buchou went firm for that match also predicting that the pawn might come out they also probably predicted that we would send the powerful rossweissesan who specialises in magic since the value was large hhmm i dont get it like i thought i probably need a servant who can act as my strategist if thats the case then will the next opponent be the queen buchou yes yuuto sairaorgs queen kuisha abaddon the one from the extra demon house of abaddon will come extra demon house of abaddon even the current 3rd ranker in the rating game is also from the house of abaddon according to what i heard its quite a powerful devil clan their household takes a certain distance away from the current government and they seem to be living quietly in the corner of the underworld i will go akenosan proposes her thoughts to buchou so akenosan is going akeno are you sure the opponents queen is a person from abaddon you know from the video shes quite a formidable enemyits just like what buchou said in the match
against glasyalabolas their queen used enormous demonic powers and also the trait of house of abaddon called hole to overwhelm her enemies and that thing called hole is a very troublesome power which can suck in anything it wants the circular shape hole appears as a hole in the atmosphere and that leads to another dimension do you want me to go i have a high chance to win against her i said that but akenosan shook her head to the side thats if you use triaina correct you cant use it yet isekun the time when a large value is rolled you have to show it in the endgame until then i will scrape off the opponents forces its a reckless thing that i can do because kibakun xenoviachan rossweissesan buchou and isekun are behind me akenosan said with a smiley face if you say that then i cant say anything back to you akenosan i understand akeno i will leave it to you yes rias lets win together saying just that akenosan disappears within the magic circle the location akenosan arrived to was a field where many giant towers built from rocks were lined up akenosan was standing
on top of a certain tower at the rooftop of the opposite building in front of her there is a blondehaired oneesan its sairaorgsans queen kuisha abaddon and it happens to be a match between a blackhair ponytail queen akenosan vs blondehair ponytail queen abbadon so you came like i thought raikou no miko20 abaddon says that yes im a bit inexperienced but nice to meet you akenosan replies fearlesslythe arbiter appears and looks at the two of them the fifth match starts now the signal for the start of the match was given akenosan and the opponent flew up the air while flapping their wings then an intense battle between demonicpower began if akenosan releases many fire attacks the opponent releases a huge ice attack if akenosan releases water the abaddon will use wind the skybattle using demonicpower is evenly matched possibly because akenosan also strengthened her demonicpower by training she is able to release much more powerful attacks then before its so powerful that the impact created from their demonicpowers started to crumble down the buildings around them but we still cant let our guards down the opponent hasnt used hole after all when akenosan creates a dark
cloud to the sky using her demonic powers she strikes down a high density holylightning towards her opponentbuzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz there was a flash and the lightning was around abaddonbut before that happens a warp is formed in the atmosphere a hole appears in the atmosphere so she used it here the high density holylightning gets sucked by the hole this is it how is this then maybe akenosan was aiming for this so she creates more holylightning in the sky buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz a lot of high density holylightning attacks the surroundings the buildings around her get destroyed by the holylightning a combo of holylightning which takes up half of the space of the battlefield goes toward abaddon if she gets hit by this even a highclass devil will receive critical damage and there arent any places she can avoid to she can do it everyone including me confirmed akenosans victory but abaddon widened her hole and she made more holes appear the giant hole and holes around it absorbs akenosans continuous strikes of holylightning akenosan became speechless after seeing that abaddon makes a cold smile
and says it my hole can expand and i can also create many of them and inside the hole i can split the attacks of the opponents it absorbed and release it like this many holes appeared which surrounds akenosan they were all directed at akenosan from the holylightning i will remove the lightning and i will just return the holy back to you piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii from the many holes a light was directed towards akenosanfor a devil light ispoisonous akenosan gets covered by the lights combatant rias gremorys queen retires the heartless announcement of the arbiter reaches our ears part 2 not only can it absorb but it can also be used as a counter like that kiba says that when he was able to let the words out from his mouth having lost akenosan we were in shock the match in demonicpower was evenly matched if that holylightning had hit her she would have won she was able to win the reason for our loss was because we took the hole of abaddon lightly shit i should have gone instead and defeated her immediately i was filled with regrets lets move on its getting close to the endgame so
we cant feel relieved yet buchou says that as if shes saying that to herself the time to roll the die for the sixth match came both kings rolls the dice the total value is12 it came the max value it came the value 12 has finally come out the meaning of this value is that the combatant sairaorg can appear for the match ooooooooooooooo the crowd stirs with the broadcasters words as if he is responding to them sairaorgsan took his shirt off at his base maybe its something he prepared for battling so he was wearing a tight black battle costume under his shirt his magnificent body stands out hes coming sairaorgsan is sairaorgsan looks this wayhis eyes are filled with fighting intents that he gives me chills its an unbelievable pressure its so heavy that all my body hair will fall and they were directed at us isekun kiba puts his hand on my shoulder kiba says it to me directly me xenovia and rossweissesan will fight sairaorgsan 2 knights and 1 rook makes a total value of 11 i see i replied like that his determination must be solid even if i say anything now i
doubt he will change his mind i will try to make the opponent get exhausted as much as i can for you and buchou kiba made the smile of a handsome guy it seems like he has made up his mind yeah i will leave it to you yuuto are you perhaps maybe he predicted what buchou was going to say so he nodded his head i cant win against sairaorg bael by myself i am very aware of that then what will be my role its simple to decrease the opponents power as much as i can even if it costs my life xenovia rossweissesan will you tag along with me xenovia and rossweissesan nod at kibas words yeah of course i never thought i can have this much courage because ise and buchou are behind me i can understand akenofukubuchos feelings its good and simple since we know what our roles are lets exhaust the opponent as long as we caneveryone had a determined face imade a smile while having my fist which is gripped so tight that its bleeding i cant let their determination go to waste i need to send them off with a smile we
are confronting this day today in order to attain victory with rias gremory for victory for our comrades we take one more step to checkmate our opponent ise and yuuto or if xenovia teams up buchou says that but kiba swings his head to the sides no we cant let isekun go yet after this battle most likely the opponents queen and isekun will fight if that happens buchou continues to explain about the plan kiba just mentioned if that happens then there will only be two opponents left though because of the rule ise cant fight consecutively thats why it will be good to make asia go in the next battle after that and make her forfeit before fighting if it becomes the last battle we wont be needing asias healing ability so making her forfeit will connect to the next game for ise so the battle after that will be between ise and sairaorg because of sairaorgs personality he wont be sending out pawn thats what it is right yuuto kiba nodded with a satisfactory face at buchous words yes like i thought you have been planning that far ahead so both buchou and kiba predicted that far
till the final match thats why this is the crucial moment we will grind down sairaorg baels power kiba had a refreshing smile and we will defeat him if we can xenovia was filled with spirits kiba makes a bitter smile yeah i was also planning to do that buchou also became prepared and breathed out deeply i will leave it to you three please give as much damage to sairaorg as you can im sorry i made a determination just before but i wastaught new things from all of you once again i really am a nave and worthless king kiba shook his head at what buchou said by meeting you all of us were saved the reason we came this far is because of buchous love towards us we will bring victory to you all of us will kiba says that and heads towards the magiccircle with xenovia and rossweissesan when he went past me he said it to me while smiling i will leave the rest to you yeah leave it to me dachikou21 and so the three of them were transferred to the battlefield the place where the three of them arrived to was a lake
sairaorgsan was already waiting there with his arms crossed is this rias plan its a quote from him where he realises everything so he must already know what our intentions are kiba and the others dont answer but sairaorgsan smiles as if he is impressed i see looks like rias has also matured he uncrosses his arms and sairaorgsan tells the three of them you guys wont be able to win against me even so you are okay with it we wont die easily like that i will send you in front of the sekiryuutei in the best condition it seems like sairaorgsan is trembling with excitement at kibas resolution good words how much further can you guys make me heated up sixth match starts nowthe arbiters signal then on all four limbs of sairaorgsan a weird mark appeared this is a restraint which puts a load on my body i will be removing this i will answer you guys by fighting at my max power paa when the shallow lights pour out from sairaorgsans limbs the mark vanishes the next moment the surroundings around sairaorgsan blew while making the noise don the wind pressure carves deeply below sairaorgsans foot
and a crater was made the water in the lakes waved violently and at the center of the crater sairaorgsans body gave out a white glow what was covering sairaorgsans body issomething like the touki that covers konekochans body no it is touki dont tell me sairaorgsan knows how to use senjutsu when i had suspicions sensei who is a commentator says it what a guy hes wearing the touki and the rich density of it which makes it visible this much so you are saying that combatant sairaorg knows how to battle using the ki the broadcaster asks sensei who also has suspicions about it no i havent received any information that he learnt how to use senjutsu emperor belial continues after sensei yes he hasnt learnt even a single bit of sennjutsu at all that is a touki which has awoken after he continued to train his taijutsu22 his body which pursued for pure power gained a power different to demonicpower and it is the base of life itself and he is wearing it around his body you can say that the excess vitality and life force within him has spurted out and made it visibleso sairaorgsan gained
a power different to demonicpower by training and he attained pure waves of power onto his body the three of them put on a serious face after feeling the pressure coming from sairaorgsan sairaorgsan roars i wont let my guard down even once you guys are warriors who came here with the resolution of being taken down you guys are not ordinary opponents i will also fight with the resolution of being taken down as well that is who i am and this is my respect towards my opponents swift sairaorgsan disappears from the scene after he moved so he did a dash right away i wont let you rossweissesan activated many magiccircle randomly and she made a stance to do fullbursts of magical attacks rossweissesan over there kiba who has grasped hold of sairaorgsans movements pointed his holydemonic sword at that direction and rossweissesans fullbursts get released towards that direction sairaorgsan appeared in that direction as well many magical attacks with different attributes get shot rossweissesan released so many attacks that i cant see her xenovias holy waves also get mixed with the magical attacks and goes flying at him hmph ban along with the sound of his fist
punching the air sairaorgsan also hits away the attacks coming at him with his fists you must be joking so that persons fist can also hit away magical attacks i became shocked sairaorgsan dodges the magical attacks and the holy waves and he shortens his distance with rossweissesan runbefore kiba tells rossweissesan to run sairaorgsans fist nails deeply into rossweissesans stomach the moment it hits her the strike was so powerful that it vibrated the atmosphere around them the valkyrie armour gets destroyed easily with that force rossweissesan made a painful expression and she gets blown far back towards the end of the lake with that punch at the same time her body gets covered with light which is used for retiring and her body falls into the lake a retire with just a single strike one down uoooooo while rossweissesan was disappearing xenovia went slashing towards sairaorgsan head on swift he disappeared and he appeared behind xenovia he tries to kick her but xenovia bends her body and avoids it gon even if she dodges it his kick shakes the atmosphere and it created a wind pressure which split the lake into half just how powerful is his kick
which can split a lake his speed is too fast xenovia gets startled i took down the nuisance magic user first now there are two swordsmen and both of them are holysword wielders seeing sairaorgsan make a fearless smile kiba and xenovia had aura running through their body kiba this guy is really bad news we cant win unless we use our full powersi know that xenovia we shouldnt think about the outcome we will lose instantly if we even think about fighting while holding back even slightly thats how this opponent is seeing both of them in high sprits sairaorgsan made a satisfied looking smile thats it try to stop my fist dash he jumped forward from the spot and he goes hitting towards kiba with his fist covered in touki kiba creates many holydemonic swords front of him and make a wall out of it break but they get destroyed easily with a single strike my holydemonic swords fragile you cant stop my attack with these kiba leaves his spot after sensing that fighting in closerange is dangerous but sairaorgsan also goes after him its extremely hard for me to follow their speed battles with my eyes fast
both of them are too fast break gu a bitter sound of metal kiba gets hit along with his holysword the holydemonic sword also gets destroyed even though you strengthened your specialty you still didnt forget to polish your techniques more than that your loyalty towards your master and comrades is strong a good knight indeed rias this guy is a magnificent knight which makes me jealous of you but your defence that is your only weak point kiba yuuto but you shouldnt feel embarrassed even if it isnt you no one can endure this punch durandal xenovia came to rescue kiba by swinging down her durandalseveral waves were created from the sword and it goes towards sairaorgsan the wave of a holysword interesting my willpower or the waves created from a holysword lets see which one is stronger sairaorgsan increases the touki around his body and he took on the wave of durandal head on the result washes unscratched sairaorgsans touki shows no signs of weakening unscratched while getting hit by that attack head on hes a monster xenovia was just able to say that while having her whole body tremble sairaorgsan bends his neck its a good wave
but it isnt enough to stop me xenovia we will do a combination kiba says that to xenovia xenovia stands up and both of them release their swords against sairaorgsan sairaorgsan dodges the swords of both the holydemonic swords and exdurandal with the minimum movements kiba took a distance he changed the holydemonic sword to a holysword immediately and made the dragonknights troop from before appear goooo receiving kibas order several dragonknights headed towards sairaorgsan so the new balancebreaker huh i will happily accept it sairaorgsan took on the dragonknights heads on and he starts to destroy the dragonknights with a strike after another strike while dodging their swords kibas dragonknights get crushed like paper there are many of them and they are fast but if im the opponentbreak while making a sound of the metal being destroyed the last dragonknights were destroyed they lack hardness those knighttroops were destroyed with just punches and kicks even kiba trembled with fear at sairaorgsans taijutsu which exceeds common sense shit both of them did even more training after they returned from kyoto because they were humiliated in the fight against siegfried the two of them trained themselves even further even so they
cant match against that man your movements tell me you are full of talents i can sense potential from your attacks but on this stage im stronger don gon sairaorgsan who dodged the slashes of both of them nails his fist into xenovias stomach and he did a sidekick to the side of kibas stomach break break i heard a disturbing sound coming from both of their bodies gaha my comrades my precious comrades who overcame deadly battles with me they are being taken down by those fists a strike with that fist takes out everything an embodiment of power his appearance when he stands in front of them covered in his touki makes him look like a fierce god kiba made a small laugh while coughing out blood isekun still fought even after receiving this attack and he still moved forward he is definitely amazing he stands up while saying thatmy body can still move thats good i can still fight i can still weaken down my enemy kiba creates a holydemonic sword within his hand xenovia also responds by standing up wobbly looks like i still cant go to sleep yet now lets go and weaken him xenovia
lets wield our swords a bit longer for isekun and for buchou both of them stand in front of sairaorgsan while making a stance with their swords the fierce god wrapped in touki made a truly happy face so the two of you will continue to entertain me yeah we will while xenovia says that rossweissesan suddenly appeared from her back and there is a single sword in her hand its a transparent sword you let your guard down how about a magical fullburst from closerange then rossweissesan who was resurrected made several magiccircles appear right in front of sairaorgsanand she released the magical attack in closerange doooooooooooooooooooooon while it made a loud explosive sound smoke was coming from sairaorgsans body they were finally able to damage his body buchou smiled the rossweisse that sairaorg defeated earlier was one of the excaliburs which had changed into exdurandals sheath its something that excalibur mimic transformed into and the one who appeared just now is the real rossweisse who made herself transparent with excalibur transparency it seems like each of the excaliburs which was added onto the exdurandal for its upgrade had their ability evolved if you get an approval from xenovia
who is the holder anyone can receive the blessing of each excalibur for a short time even if you dont hold the factor to be a holysword wielder it can change its form into the one holding it and it caneven make the one holding it become transparent but even if i said that its not like you are able to wield the actual holysword itself and it seemed like there is a limit on how much time you can activate it each day is this buchous tactics or kiba and the others tactics either way its amazinnnnnng so thats why the arbiter didnt announce rossweissesans defeat you remember how xenovia was shooting the holy wave when rossweisse released the magical fullburst at sairaorg most likely the two excalibur of transparency and mimic were hidden within those holy waves rossweisse caught them she made a mimic of herself and she hid herself by being transparent looking for an opening buchou explains it to me so what was the reason that the fake rossweissesan was glowing then she must have put on a spell on her fake its an act she did to make sairaorg let his guard down the reason
why rossweisse is able to hold onto the holysword is because she casted many spells on her hands which weakens the damage she will receive from the holy power she did say she is able to hold it for a short time amazing so they created a fighting style like this i was always thinking where to use the abilities of xenovias holy sword i told them a couple of ways to use it but it seems like they mastered using it like this man those three are amazing its enough if they can do a combo like that for an instant sairaorgsan who received the magical fullburst directly from close rangestood up while having blood come out from his front body i did feel suspicious because there wasnt any announcement i thought that you were in a state where you were barely able to remain without retiring being unconscious in the depth of the lake that was magnificent all of you sairaorgsan praised kiba and others combobut his eyes became sharper when he gripped tight of his right hand he pulled it back slowly the touki covering his whole body gathers around his fist and his right hand became
buffed along with giving my respect to all of you i want to give this to all of you as well maybe they felt something so the three of them retreated back immediately kiba shouts after taking a distance xenovia this is the critical moment we will go along with that plan it happened when kiba shouted his fist was released dooooooooon the vision shook violently when i looked everything in front of sairaorgsan was wiped away till the end of the field it looks as if a massive earthquake occurred rias gremorys rook retires buchou and i became shocked at the same time with the announcement was rossweissesan taken out with the attack just now it seems like she retired for real this time he swings away the smoke created by the pressure from his fist and sairaogsan once again grips tightly with his fist and pulls it back slowly this is a punch which can give critical wounds by even touching it slightly a halfhearted attack wont be able to stop this a righthand punch which is covered with huge amounts of touki is about to be released once again kiba and xenovia went slashing towards sairaorgsan they
are aiming for sairaorgsans right arm kibas holydemonic sword slashes down at sairaorgsans right arm but he couldnt cut it off and instead the blade gets crushed just from the toukiand xenovias durandal also comes down but it got stopped by the touki and she couldnt cut in deep with it xenovia bites her teeth hard but kiba also grabs onto the durandals handle kiba and xenovia gripped onto durandal together that moment durandal gave an enormous flash and aura and it cut off sairaorgsans right arm the right arm covered in touki gets cut off but it doesnt vanish and just drops on to the ground are you telling me the life force in sairaorgsan is stronger than the holy power but then kiba swings down the durandal if i remember kiba can also wield durandal if he gets xenovias approval it sure makes me jealous that you can attack with durandal while holding it together but my joy stops there magnificent i will give you my right arm with this i have to use the pheonixs tear whether i like it or not i so want to fight with my full power at the final match after all
saying only that sairaorgsan kicks xenovia up high and when she floated up in the air for a bit he started to do a combo with his punches and kicks and then he slammed her on the ground at the end the light disappeared from xenovias eyes she lost her consciousness with that attack just now kiba tries to take a distance after seeing that midair combo but sairaorgsans massive left hand caught his face he slams his face on the ground while dashing forward while dragging kibas body sairaorgsan who is grinding kibas body to the ground kicks his body up and then when kibas body was lifted up the air sairaorgsan nails his thrust deeply into kibas stomach don that punch made a loud sound that it shook the whole surrounding sairaorgsans punch goes pasts kibas body and it blows away the lake behind kiba while falling down kiba smiled with his battered face our duty isaccomplished whats leftis for my master and my best friend to defeat yousaying only that kiba and xenovia disappear into the light i can only say that you guys were splendid i am grateful that i was able to fight you guys
sairaorgsan says that while picking up his right arm it sounds like there arent any lies behind his words isekun buchou please win against this person combatant rias gremorys two knights retirespawn i rias gremory realised that i felt relieved more than sadness after seeing sairaorg using the phoenix tears on his right arm which was cut off the damage yuuto and the others gave desperately it was so much that it forced sairaorg to use the phoenix tears they had a magnificent fight if it was just me until recently then i would have been full with sadness i wouldnt be able to endure it with losing my servants but its different now there is a big part of me which feels joy at being able to push sairaorg to the corner did i become used to cruelty or has my love lessened i think its neither of them seeing my adorable servants fighting desperately for me and their comrades something changed inside me drastically i think i was able to become stronger not just me we became stronger together not just our bodies but also our hearts now lets move onto the next match this time they should
be sending their queen so we will be sending ise i then became speechless when i looked towards him thats because the thing emitting from ises body is clearly a killing intent and a very strong hostility they were directed towards the opponents base asia was also trembling a bit at ises change now this is near the endgame will the two kings roll their dice please i stood in front of the stand after being urged to by the broadcaster the act of rolling this die puts stress on my mentality what value will i roll just predicting that makes me think even more the more i think the more i will get trapped dice figure this actually puts more weight on the kings than it looksi roll the die on top of the stand the value which was rolled is5 how about sairaorg when i looked at the vision the value he rolled was 4 the total value is 9 we got this value with one roll we will send ise from our side and they will probably send their queen chills ise takes a step the face when ise turned around had a strong intensity on his
face buchou asia i will be going saying that he walks towards the magic circle the moment he was being transferred i saw a glimpse of his face it was filled with anger the battlefield ise was transferred to was a colosseum with no sights of people the one who appeared opposite him is the queen kuisha abaddon she seems to be in wonder at ises unusual calmness hyoudou issei you seem really calm i thought you would be happy to have me who is a woman as your opponent i am happy i welcome beauties anytime after a moment of pause he shows a forced smile riasoneesama isesan is yes you are right im sure hes been enduring itasia and i know him very well thats why i understood hes just about to explode he is someone who thinks dearly of his comrades the most yet he didnt panic that much he who is someone who gets mad and sad at seeing his comrades being defeated barely showed any emotions today the arbiter appears between the two and the match was about to begin ise spread his arms and started to talk to himself its okay now right i
dont have to endure any longer now right kiba akenosan konekochan xenovia gasper and rossweissesan i cant hold it anymore it seems like abaddon seems to be suspicious at ise talking to himself the seventh match begin now the signal was given abaddon didnt do anything much and was waiting for ise to move sekiryuutei get into balance breaker my master sairaorgsama wishes to see you become serious then i his queen have to make that wish come true shes a woman with strong resolution that person she must have feelings for sairaorg the countdown ended and ise said a single sentence to abaddon after wearing his armour i cant hold back if you dont want to die put all your strength into defending if you do that then you will be able to retire safely you sure talk big very well i will also stop you with my full power whether its the sekiryuutei for master i will i have warned you ises body gets enveloped by red lights welsh sonicboost knighhhhhhhhhht change star sonicthe armour gets purged and ise leaps forward in godspeed in a velocity of godspeed ise arrives in front of abaddon before she reacts even
i couldnt see him at all until he closed in ise then shouts while enveloping his body with red aura welsh dragonic roooooooook change solid impact ises armour which has gotten thicker uoooooooooooooooo ise who makes a loud shout while having the percussion hammer on his shoulder ring his punch gets faster while pouring out more aura that strike without any hesitation goes at abaddon flash before that happens abaddons body gets covered in light and she disappears from the field goooooooooooooooon the strike which hits the air destroys the colosseum without a trace combatant sairaorg baels queen retires the arbiter announces its ises victory everything ended instantly he shortened the distance with triaina and he also tried to settle the match instantly as well abaddon didnt even have time to make the hole appear but that strike didnt hit her before it was about to hit the queen it looked as if she was forced to retire by someone no she was forced to retire by her master sairaorg sairaorg appears on the monitor he had a mortified expression i made kuisha retire forcefully at that rate she would have been killed by sekiryuutei you were trying to kill
her were you notsairaorg said it to ise who is on the field ise opens the mask of his helm he then said it while showing his face im sorry i just couldnt keep my hostility at your team down please forgive me by thinking that action was on behalf of my juniors i felt chills from his cold voice and cruel words like i thought he is someone who values his comrades and he released his anger which was at his limits sairaorg smiled happily after realising it what eyes its filled with killing intent sairaorg then argues while on the camera i even saw dreams about crossing my fists with the sekiryuutei so i want to question the committee isnt it enough now its foolish to let this man fight under the rules for the next match i wish for a team battle with everything on my side against everything from their side team battle does he mean to fight against me ise and asia with his pawn and himself thats most likely the case sairaorgs intention is to fight with this current tension while having a break to resume the fight he wished to fight the sekiryuutei
in his best condition he must have thought that this current situation is the best timing the crowd stirs at sairaorgs suggestion and the broadcaster also shouts ooo we have received a suggestion from combatant sairaorg in this situation emperor belial says it while smiling certainly it is easy to predict the flow after this since there is a rule that you cant participate continuously the next match will be between baels pawn and the gremorys bishop and after thatit would have been the final battle between sairaorg and the sekiryuutei that is easy to predict there certainly is a point that it would be boring azazel also gives his comments while putting his hand on his chinif thats the case they can settle it with a team battle thats easy to understand and we can continue to watch the match under this tension now will the higherups of the committee choose the current rule which is easy to predict or will they choose to pick the teambattle i dont mind it as well if that is the one they want i also agree to his comments after all the next match would be just a waste to have decided
it right away by taking that match away that will be easier to understand a few minutes passed and a report was given to the broadcaster eh yes i just received the report from the committee it seems like they agree to it the next match will be a teambattle which will settle everything it will be an allout battle with the remaining members the stadium stirs with that announcement its an obvious reaction since the next match will be the final match hearing the decision sairaorg declares to ise fearlessly so thats how it is i might over do it i wont say dont hold a grudge against me if you get killed but just be prepared that you might be killed ise also replies by smiling im going at you with the intention of killing you if i dont do that then it doesnt seem like i can beat you and i also wont be able to face my comrades i sure cant endure it any longer the battle between these two men i wont be able to stop it anymore the final match is about to beginlife max vs power mansekiryuutei vs manshishiou part 1 both buchou
and i who was already wearing the armour put our feet down inside the spacious plain i started to calm down after exploding and snapping at sairaorgsan man i cant believe i became furious like that i havent had a killing intent like that for a long time well thats how painful it was to see my comrades being taken down then the announcer spoke now the final battle for the youngdevils between bael and gremory has proceeded to the last stage this last battle is a group battle as was suggested by sairaorg the bael side has the king sairaorg and the mysterious masked pawn regulus the gremory side who is opposing them consists of switchprincess rias the king and everyones hero oppai dragon also known as the pawn hyoudou issei the sekiryuutei man our introduction was horrible even buchou had her face a bit red zoom zoom iyaaan oppai the children gave an oppaidragonish cheer from the seats thank you everyone we left asia at the base the reason was explained before the match started but a healer would be targeted first so having her in the team would mean a lot of risk for us she would
obviously not become a hostage but both buchou and i wont be able to look if she were to get attacked cruelly well it might be a harsh thing to say but she wouldnt be of any help for this battle we will feel safe if we have someone who can heal us but our opponent was sairaorgsan and the pawn who consumed 7 pieces if she was to be targeted i am confident in defending her but we will definitely receive damage if that happens our chances of winning will be further away im sorry asia since the situation is like this just stay back for this battle either way if either the king as buchou and sairaorg fall then the battle will be over now i would like to start the battle the arbiter came between the two teams then please startfinally the last battle commenced both me and the opponent pawn promote to queen quickly my power was raised buchou and i made our battle stances but sairaorgsan made a small laugh rias theres something i want to say before the fight sairaorgsan says it directly your servants are wonderful they care about you so much that
it makes me jealous because of that they were all strong foes if a worthy rival says that then they will also be relieved to have fought what is left is to defeat this man and claim our victory we only consist of myself and the pawn over there your side is basically the same its basically the end of the game sairaorgsan stands in front of me hyoudou issei this is finally it we havent fought since the sparring in the basement of the gremory castle that time i was no match against him but i have gotten stronger since then i have no grudge against you i have no hatred towards you this is just a game i point my fingers at him but i will be taking revenge for my comrades im not mature enough to forgive you when you have taken down my comrades hearing me it seems like sairaorgsan shivered from the bottom of his heart a phrase that sounds like you are at your limits like i thought you are a man who cant endure the defeat of your comrades you have done well to endure till now burst it out yeah thats good
this is something worthy of being called the beginning of a decisive battle gooooon i made the thrusters on my back go to the maximum and went towards sairaorgsan head on sairaorgsan also covered his body with touki and jumped towards me by kicking the ground mine and sairaorgsans fistscrossed head on our fists landed on each others faces like a crosscounter goon even if i was wearing the armour the intense pain that felt like it will burst my insides went to my head the helmet got destroyed with that attack but i havent started yet lets do it ddraig ou boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost the boosted power went to my fist it increased its speed the moment it hit sairaorgsans face baaaaaaaaan i was able to land such a good punch that its dry sound reverberated throughout the surroundings drip blood burst out from sairaorgsans nose and blood came out from the edge of his mouth his body also trembled a bit that hit just now is the hit my comrades couldnt land on you after i said that sairaorgsan wiped his mouth its a strong punch it
feels as if your spirit is coming inside my body in such a short time you turned into a devil how much burden have you put on your body its a power that cant be attained normally i felt that you were taking me lightly because you didnt use the new ability you showed to kuisha seems i was wrong even with that balancebreaker your power is high well yeah this balancebreaker state was the easiest to use so i have been training my basics with it to continue doing basic training in this state even though you gained a new ability i can only respect youddraig says it with an amazed voice but thanks to that i have found out that i can give damage to sairaorgsan who is coated with touki if i hit him in a counter ddraig just increase my defence when i receive his attack understood but if i keep on doing that your stamina will also decrease its better than getting hit this is the climax i will go all out after saying that to ddraig the fist fight between me and sairaorgsan started it was a punch and kick from close range the
truth was that his martial arts were better than mine so there was a limit to what i could do with the martial arts that i have learned in real battle there was a huge gap in experience between us but thanks to the fact that i had been having fierce battles in actual combat i was able to hold my ground against sairaorgsan i had left the defence to ddraig so i was able to cope with sairaorgsans fists that were covered with touki an attack that has been honed in actual combat i see you are able to hit me without having second thoughts because of it he was laughing i on other hand was being serious after exchanging a few strikes i took my distance and looked at the enemy pawn the pawn who was fighting against buchou took off his mask the face revealed was that of a boy who was about the same age as me but that changed instantly boko beki the boys body started to morph while making a noise his body gradually started to get bigger and was morphing into something else golden fur started appearing all over his body and his
limbs became thicker his mouth ripped open revealing sharp fangs a tail appeared and long golden fur appeared around its neck roooooooooar what appeared was a gigantic lion it had a big body that was about four to five meters tall it had something like a jewel on its forehead it stood in front of buchou while wavering its hair oooooooooo the identity of the bael teams mysterious pawn is a huge lion it seemed like the announcer was shocked as well of course i was also shocked so it was a lionwait is that the nemean lion no that jewel is it seemed like sensei who was the commentator realised something and became shocked the announcer then asked him what do you mean it was originally the opponent who the original hercules faced in one of his twelve labours the god from the bible captured one of them and sealed it inside the sacred gear it became something that was listed as one of the thirteen longinus if you master it you can split the earth in a single swing and it can also transform into a huge lion the regulus nemea i remember it also had an ability
to protect the possessor from projectile weapons but i received the information that the possessor has been missing for the past several years i never thought it would have become the pawn of bael team are you serious that huge lion is a longinus it was a shocking revelation but sairaorgsan shook his head no unfortunately the possessor is already dead when i found the actual possessor of the regulus nemea he was already killed by a mysterious group the sacred gear that had the form of an axe was the only thing left the battleaxe that was supposed to disappear because the host died turned into a lion by its own will and annihilated the group that killed its possessor so the sacred gear moved by itself even after the possessor died that was my first time hearing something like this thats when i made it into my servant i thought it was a fateful meeting brought by my mothers lion ruler bloodline sairaorgsans mother originally came from the house of vapula that rules over lions so it was a destined meeting a sacred gear that moves by itself by its own will and its a longinus on top
of that it reincarnated into a devil is it the lion that is amazing or the evilpiece that is amazing either way this interests me a lot very interesting indeed hmmm no wonder we couldnt locate it shit why do rare phenomenon occur to the longinus in this era forget that sairaorg bring that lion to my laboratory next time i really want to research itwow he had an incredibly happy face your face is shining sensei so that reincarnated lion is a very rare phenomenon even im shocked that things like this happen in my case my thoughts are cut when the possessor dies the next time i regain my consciousness im already inside the sacred gear of the next possessor so its different from ddraig then the power is very unstable maybe because it doesnt have its possessor its not something i can send out until this game it wont be a matter of battles if it goes berserk and attacks both enemy and allies if i am able to send it out then its only the time when it can team up with me just like now if something happens im the only one who can stop
it sairaorgsan explained so that was the reason why he didnt send out the pawn until the very last moment it was risky to send it out without sairaorgsan who could control it so it is a servant that is hard to send out under the dicefigure rule either way my opponent is that longinus then buchou made her stance against the lion buchou i will leave him to you i will take care of sairaorgsan then both buchou and i went towards our opponents i thrust my fist while buchou released her power of destruction but there will be no end to this at this rate i have to use the triaina to defeat sairaorgsan there was a high possibility that i would have lost in that battle gradually getting weakened at that rate if i was to finish it then it had to be in a blitz23 he went down and then stood up i also went down and then stood up i continued to fight him without even a break my mouth was being filled with blood it was still safe if i could still taste my blood i wanted to use ascalon and attack but with
my low skills at using swords it will be hard to give damage to that man who was covered in touki it was more effective to damage him in a fist fight im familiar with while fighting i also realised the abnormal movement of sairaorgsan the punch from his right arm was slightly slower than his left arm it seemed like the impact was slightly weaker as well was that the injuries of having his rightarm cut off by kiba and xenovia showing its effect it couldnt completely heal itself even with the phoenix tear i will send you in front of the sekiryuutei in the best condition i replayed the words said by kibaflow i was in tears inside the armour i received your pass pal it was the moment he punched with his right arm i have gotten the hang of the impact and the speed of that punch you mightve not had any weakness but its different now my friends sairaorgsans right fist thrusts towards me i released a punch to his right arm the moment when his arm became straight boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost my boosted
punch killed the impact of his right arm it also made his body flinch this is it i found the right moment to give it my all i changed the piece of the evilpiece inside me and made the power of sekiryuutei explode welsh dragonic rook change solid impact the red aura around me increased my body became covered in a very thick armour i did an uppercut to sairaorgsan with my gigantic fist i nailed down the percussion hammer to increase its damage baaaaaaang sairaorgsans body flies high up after making a loud explosive sound made a weakness in you who didnt have one im talking about that rightarm of yours to go after sairaorgsan who was up in the air i changed the evilpieces inside me welsh blaster bishop change fang blast my armour went back to the original thickness then it created a backpack on my back and cannons on my shoulders i aimed the cannons towards sairaorgsanbuuuuuuun the cannon started to charge aura while making a silent sound the triainabishops weakness was the charging time but i can aim for my target if he is up in the air dragon blasteeeeeeeeeeer baaaaaaaaaaaaaaanng the intense blast that
was shot from my cannon sairaorgsan makes his wings appear and tries to fix his position but ku he gets shot by the dragon blast released from my rightshoulder cannon and the left one misses him just a little the cannons their role already fulfilled turned into a red aura and vanished up in the air engulfed in smoke sairaorgsan descends to the ground slowly i was breathing violently looks like i used up too much aura and stamina i still havent taken him down completely yet it will be bad if i dont save my stamina and aura sairaorgsan who landed on the ground was covered in wounds but not fatal ones the moment just before he was about to be hit by my cannon he covered himself in touki touki that comes from the bases of life span this man was filled with excess lifespan his defence was really abnormal sairaorgsan then made a satisfied smile strong for you to be this strong he seemed satisfied with my attacks now how should i attack him next while i was thinking about the next attack i heard a scream kya buchous scream when i looked in her direction buchou
was on her knees bleeding the lion stood in front of buchou while having received damage buchou was in danger rias gremory will retire due to blood loss at this rate the lion spoke that lion can speak if you want to save her then use the phoenix tear he did that on purpose this guy had the power to take down buchou if he had wanted to not doing it meant that he wants us to use the phoenix tear the bael team had already used it so they cant use itanymore we still hadnt used ours the enemy lion was watching attentively at the battle between me and sairaorgsan if i say that it was unnecessary then my quality as a king will decrease very well i will allow that but i will have the battle between sekiryuutei and i continue regulus i understand very well my apologies its an action i took as my loyalty towards you my master the lion and sairaorgsan hadnt resumed their attack i went towards buchou while being alert and took out a small bottle from her pocket buchou i will use this on you im ashamed for meto become a restraint
to you buchou seemed frustrated she couldnt forgive herself as a king who couldnt resist against the lion but please endure it if you were to be taken down then its game over for us i sprinkled the tear inside the small bottle onto buchou it removed the wounds while creating tendrils of smoke with this we were even after using the tears whats left was whether i could defeat sairaorgsan or not it was a fifty fifty chance no there was a high possibility that i could defeat sairaorgsan if i use the triaina again he was also wounded when i was thinking what to do next the lion shouts sairaorgsama use me please wear me if its that balancebreaker then you will transcend sekiryuutei are you trying to throw away a match that you can win the lion said that wear it the lion balancebreaker then sairaorgsan made an angry roar close your mouth thatthat is the power i decided to use only during a crisis in the underworld what will come out of it if i use that in front of this man i will fight this man only with this body i see perhaps this person
could still become even stronger if he really shows his best will i be able towin but i do have an interest in it how much stronger will he become this man whom i respect how much overwhelming power will he show me when he gets serious sairaorgsan allowed me to use triaina which was like a cheat at that point i had no right to reject sairaorgsan becoming serious please use the power of the lioni naturally said that buchou who is beside me was shocked but i still continued im sorry everyone im such an idiot im trying to throw away the chance of winning that everyone made for me but but i theres no meaning if i cant surpass sairaorgsan who hasnt used that there will be no meaning for me to be training till this day by the time i realised it i was speaking out my true thoughts today i will claim victory by defeating you who becomes serious we are fighting for our dreams what can we achieve by not defeating our opponent who is at his best the shouts that came from my heart buchou also said you really are stupid with a
shocked face while putting her face close to me im sorry buchou but since i said that i will take responsibility by winning after a pause sairaorgsan makes a creepy smile im sorry somewhere inside my heart i thought that this is a game that there will be a second chance it seem like i was thinking nave things like that what foolish thoughts i had don sairaorgsans body was getting filled with high spirits im angry with myself for not realising that i wont have a fight like this again regulus sir the master who called his lion the lion who answered his master the huge lion glowed in a golden colour it turned into light particles and went towards sairaorgsan then lets do it i have determined today that this will be a stage for a battle to the death dont hold a grudge at me even if i kill you hyoudou issei sairaorgsan who was covered in goldenparticles said that loudly my lion king of nemea you who has been called shishiou24 answer my howl and turn into an armour dooooooooonthe whole field shook what was this did this field the artificial space start to lose its
endurances from sairaorgsan who is going to be serious sairaorgsan and the lion burst open while blowing away the scenery around herebalancebreak balancebreak a dazzling light spread around the field because of its intense light buchou and i covered our faces with our arm when the light vanished what appeared in front of me was a golden coloured plate armour which had a motif of a lion the helm on its head had golden hair which looked like that of a lion there was a lionlike face on its chest and the eyes on it glowed as if it had its own consciousness the balancebreaker of the regulus nemea the regulus rey leather rex hyoudou issei i thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me serious thats why i will reward you with my fist come at me with that powerful rook sairaorgsan who was walking towards me step by step says that there was an overwhelming presence by seeing the armour covered in touki man seems like all the guys who i fight against have an armourtype balancebreaker you can say that forms like that are of the shape that is the closest to the ultimate
for those who mainly fight using direct attacks you wear a massofpowerlike armour and hit your opponent with it thats why it ends up in a form like that ddraig tells me i see if you mainly fight in fistfights you get a good balance in terms of offence and defence by wearing the armour that is like a mass of power that must be it since i who is also using it also think that its true sairaorgsan who was just an inch away from me says now give me your shot dont regret it then i will hit you with my maximum welsh dragonic rook change solid impact my armour gets thicker and my arms got several times bigger as well i pulled back my massive fist and push it forward i increased the power of it by using the percussion hammer located in my elbow when it touches himgan my massive fist was easily stopped by sairaorgsans left hand i received the impact you must be kidding me it was a new technique that specialized in both offence and defence no i havent finished yet if i use the percussion hammer again to increase the impact then
i will bang the percussion hammer is nailed down and my fist increases its my massive fist was easily destroyed when it hit sairaorgsans hand my defense was also supposed to have increased so this is your limit sairaorgsan says that gakyaaaaaaan sairaorgsans fist went deeply inside my thick stomach and my armour crumbles easily his fist reached till the body inside the armour thus destroying my body gough i spit out a lot of blood from my mouth then i lost conciousness part 2 when i realised it i was in a white world i remember this place yes this is the inside of the sacred gear i came here often when i tried to persuade the past senpais right now im there i was supposed to be having a fight with sairaorgsan i cornered him sairaorgsan then got serious by wearing the lionarmour then my triaina rook didnt work on him when i looked around the past senpais were around i thought that they were unemotional like before but they had an angered face while having black aura around them juggernaut driveits juggernaut drive they were saying creepy things like that juggernaut drive what do they mean then
a vision appeared in the white world i could see myself in it it was me who was being held by buchou i had my armour destroyed and i was puking a lot of blood from my mouth i could see that i was in a critical situation just by looking at it sairaorgsan and i were fighting i received a punch from sairaorgsan who merged with the lion and then i does it mean that my consciousness was sent inside the sacred gear juggernaut drive juggernaut drive is the only solution yes thats the only solution that man is seeking it the past senpai got up from the chair and showed a creepy smile while covered in black aura there was black aura coming out of my body as well its starts to cover my body and at the same time an ill feeling was coming from inside me what was that grudge pain hatred it was increasing inside me that man i detestsairaorgsan i want to defeat him i want power absolute power for thati want to eliminate sairaorgsan from this world i ku elshasanbelzardsani it was the moment my heart was about to be consumed by hatred
i can hear voices from the vision the cries of the children oppaidragon died no please stand up i can hear the bitter screams im sorry i can no longer when my conscious was about to be taken over by darkness i heard a single voice echoing to this white world you cant crya childs voice the vision changed it showed a certain boy wearing a hat im familiar with that boy yes the boy who was crying because he couldnt participate in my autograph signing at my hero show that boy rilenkusu shouted towards the children in the crowds who were crying oppaidragon said it to me that men arent allowed to cry he said that you have to stand up no matter what and become strong enough to protect girls those were the words i had said to rilenkusu who was crying hearing that other children stood up oppaidragon wont lose oppai oppai oppai please stand up oppaidragon oppai oppaidragon chichiryutei the voices that desperately call for me everyonei i also heard a familiar voice it was irina who was being a cheerleader by the childrens seats thats right everyone isekunoppaidragon kept on standing up no matter what

me there are people who seek me there are children who root for me it was then i heard a voice a voice that i know the voice of the person who is always beside me and who always cheers me up ise can you hear me everyone is calling for you the vision changed and my master appeared the colour of crimson appears in front of me the same hair colour as that person red a crimson hair that is more brilliant than the colour of strawberry red yes that persons beautiful and long crimson hair was always beside me yes thats right even that time when i was on the verge of death what appeared in my eyes was a brilliant crimson the same colour as the colour of blood but i think its different now its noble gentle and warm the crimson that envelopes me yes istarted from that colour im the same im also looking for you you know thats because i the woman i love rias gremory i also a dark voice gets closer to me who is thinking about hernow the current sekiryuutei hyoudou issei lets rampage lets activate the juggernautdrive one of the
senpais said that while wearing a black aura but the voices that were calling me also increased oppai dragon do your best stand up oppai oppai i can also hear that mans voice whats wrong hyoudou issei is this the end you arent finished right then try to stand up your feelings arent something so weak yeah thats right it hasnt finished yet i wont let it finish i can still fight my senpais dont waver their black aura even when they heard the voices of the children and sairaorgsan now lets destroy him with the power of destruction shut up i said it while looking at all of the senpais cant you hear it the voices that call for me not just buchou but all of those voices of the children no it is the way of the heavenly dragon to become the king of destruction impossible things like that are impossible wrong iwont become the king of destruction i am hyoudou issei im just a sukebe25 if i have to then i will become a horny king no the king of destruction the juggernaut drive is the actual way that has been planted inside this sacred gear let
him that person appears while interrupting senpais words there was one man enveloped in white light then one of the senpais becomes enragedyou are the man in white light said it to me i am one of the past albion what albion so he is one of the past hakuryukou yes that time when you inserted the jewel of albion into the boosted gear it seems like the fragment of my thoughts were in it though the real me would be inside the divine dividing ah i certainly did that then i took in this person at that time then the albion senpai offers his hand sekiryuutei this must be fate as well i shall help you i will try to use my ability of halving to suppress down the thing that is swirling inside the boosted gear are you sure im a sekiryuutei and not vali the albionsenpai smiles at my words you are interesting i can understand why two of the strongest sekiryuuteis in history vanished while laughing if its you who has enthusiasm and amusement that can blow away the curse then you might be able to change the heavenlydragon no you may be able to lead
the twoheavenly dragons to the new possibility thats why senpai raised his hand up high and the light spread around you have to become the new dragon together with vali lucifer flash a shallow silverwhite light spread through the white world it started to take away the black aura belonging to the past sekiryuuteis the power of their hatred was also halved and vanished the blackaura also got halved and got reduced that was the power of albionsenpai the hatred grudge and feelings of resentment started reducing i wont let you hatred sadness and hatred itself is the sacred gear of sekiryuutei having the curse inside spreading the resentment to destroy is the way of the heavenlydragon i said it to the senpais who couldnt stop their hatred even nowoppai i was saved by this and i will continue to seek it even from now but my senpais started chanting juggernautdrive as their last resort i who is about to awaken am the heavenlydragon that has stolen the principle of domination no i made a different chant by myself i who is about to awaken am the sekiryuutei who has discarded the principle of domination i laugh at the infinite
and reject the dream i shall walk the road of righteousness by having the infinite dream and hope i shall become the reddragon king of domination i shall become the king of crimson dragon and i shall sink you to the crimson purgatory and i promise you all i will show you the future that shines in truecrimson light the senpais made a bright expression at my last chant future you will show us the future yes i will show you no lets see it together i will show it to you together with me to my comrades to my friends to the woman i love to the children we will show them future we will create the future not destroying but future yes we can do that if we join our power together lets go senpais im a sekiryuutei oppaidragon the man who is in love with rias gremory i am hyoudou isseeeeeeeeeeei in the vison buchous breast who is holding me glows in crimson colour the crimson aura then envelops my bodylife maximum vs power crimson and red crimson i was enveloped in a crimson light when i opened my eyes i was lying to the side while
receiving a crimson light emitted from buchous oppai her oppai is glowing yes i remember buchous breasts are glowing but buchou is even more shocked than me ise that appearance buchou is opening her eyes wide hmn i also looked at my whole body after being concerned is the colour of my armour darker the shape is a bit different from the usual one its like a brilliant crimson colour rather than red it is the same colour as buchous hair oooo when i thought that sekiryuutei was enveloped in red aura by getting flashed by switchprincesss oppai flash he stood up while changing his armour the announcer shouted did i get resurrected my wound isgone the cracked part of my armour has been repaired as well i met with the senpai in the whiteworld i was then enveloped in a blackaura butwas saved by the voices of the children buchous voice that was calling me and albionsenpai partner oo ddraig what happened your consciousness was blown to the depth of the sacred gear i tried to go there but the past hosts consciousnesses were dense so i couldnt enter and when i thought that i opened my eyes something
like this happened what happened inside most of the curse that the possessors had has vanished i see so the curse has its all thanks to albionsenpai you mean the jewel of albion that had the fragment of consciousness left so that was moving in the depths of the sacred gear seems like it im not actually sure but he helped meso you were able to promote to the queen while you have the power of sekiryuutei released hm am i a queen right now i check the piece inside me its true even though it was said to be impossible im a real queen im shocked but i hear the analysis from sensei red aura no that isnt red its a more brilliant and noble colour that is truecrimson colour yes crimson the same colour as the hair of the man called as crimson satan and the same hair colour as the woman that idiot fell for yes its a crimson coloured armour its a darker colour than red so crimson the miracle that is only allowed for that idiot wait werent you supposed to power up by sucking riass breast like hell i would know that sensei that
is something that was mistranslated at the press conference and it happened to appear in the front page of the newspaper i also want to power up by sucking her breasts actually i just want to suck breasts seeing the change in me sairaorgsan spoke something i would call cardinal crimson queen that colour has the exact same colour as the maousama who is called crimson the same colour as riass hair i blew out air from my mouth i then made up my mind and spoke out somehow i feel like i can say it more like sensei blurted out my feelings just now its the colour of the woman i love buchou rias gremory is the woman i love i want the woman i love to win i want to protect the woman i love i want to fight for the woman i love ii i said it i finally said it now i dont care what happens im going to confess i shouted really loud i will defeat you in front of the woman i love and the children who follow me for my dream for the childrens dream for rias gremorys dream today i will surpass
you i looooooooove rias gremorybuchous face became so red that id never seen her get this red before i spoke my feelings i just need to follow through with it i dont care what happens now hahahahahahahahahahaha sairaorgsan laughs heartily seems like you achieved something after receiving the light emitted by riass breast then i shall defeat you and make it a stepping stone for my dream i became enveloped with a vast amount of crimson aura and went ahead at godspeed star sonic booster it seems like the surrounding scenery will blow away if i just think about it the speed itself has that of triainaknight no it seems like i can go even faster maybe it depends on the training from now on sairaorgsan also covers his body in touki preparing to take me head on solid impact booster the offence and defence should be the same as that of triainarook but i can attack with lower consumption no even if it can improve even more this is enough can it become even stronger no the defence of this armour still hasnt been stabilised its basically a crab that just shed its shell if you over do it
you will receive intense damage is that right ddraig but i wont win against this man if i dont give it my all i hit him and i also get hit i just kept on hitting him he also kept on hitting me the face the stomach the chest the arms i just continued hitting and i also continued getting hit the armour breaks even if it gets repaired on time he hit me aiming for it each blow sairaorgsan and i gave each other start to destroy our bodies the field shakes every time it happens the ground split open and holes are created in this dimension its just stupidly straightforward and insanely highpowered attacks that is the fist fight we are having i dont care about defending i dont have time to defend if i dont hit him if i dont keep on hitting him this man wont go down thats why i just hit him this wont finish even if we break eachothers bodies i wont be able to take this man down unless i fight until i shatter his spirit then the announcer shouted its a fist fight an incredible fist fight is occurring at the
centre of the field it doesnt have any magnificent tactics its not a fight of finetuned demonicpowers its a close range fight like a childrens brawl they hit and they get hit something simple like that is incredibly intense and seems like it would break the whole field the viewers are all standing both old and young both man and woman everyone is excited damn these two are incredible sairaorg sairaorg oppaidragon oppaidragon i see so the viewers are all heated up as well if they are getting heated up with just a simple and unskilful fist fight like this then i will just continue to hit if i can defeat this person then i will hit him as much as i can partner the queen form hasnt fully synchronised with you the increase of the power will start from now but at this rate the balancebreak form will be removed then try to maintain it somehow ddraig its only a bit more i wont lose i will go forward by beating this person for buchou and for myself i i will defeat you and i will rise up the crimson aura covers my right arm and my right arm
morphs into that of triainarooks i will increase the impact by nailing down the percussion hammer and increase the damage solid impact booster my fist goes deep inside sairaorgsans stomach i shattered the lions armour my fist even goes deep into his physical body i did the same thing he did to me before receiving the punch sairaorgsan drops on his knee his legs are shaking it seems like the damage is serious sairaorgsan then raged to his feet what happened my legs why do you shake not yet this is just the startsairaorgsan takes a big step and stands up he still has touki around his body but the amount of touki has decreased from before i can win i can win against this person i felt that the victory is within my grasp but this man in front of me increases his will to fight endure it endure it my body do you think i can name myself as the next heir of the house of great king bael if i dont taste a great fight like this what strong spirit me too it looks like i cant go forward unless i beat the current you i try
to punch sairaorgsan who comes at me i then pulled my arm back and released my kick aiming for his calf there was a slight opening in his defence because of my feint i successfully created a chance in a fight like this another effort in training showed its usefulness my daily training wasnt in vain gasha i destroy his calf along with the armour covering it if your legs are getting weak then i will be aiming for it sairaorgsans body trembles without a moment to spare i nailed my fist into his face his helm gets broken in half and my fist hits directly onto his face sairaorgsan gets blown away backwards i expanded my dragonwings and made the cannons appear from it in this queen form the cannons are put inside the dragon wings duuuuuuuuuu it charges up silently and the energy was gathered in a lower charge time than that of triainabishop from azazels comment before you can say that the lions sacred gear has resistance to projectile weapons rather than shooting a blast to destroy the whole area wouldnt it give more damage if you just concentrate the blast into one point yeah ddraig minimise
the blast area as small as possible to increase the damage i can give him crimson blaaaaaaaaaster fang blast booster a crimson aura was shot and it envelops sairaorgsan after creating a huge explosion the smoke stops and creates a big crack on the ground at the centre of the crater sairaorgsan was lying on the ground he doesntseem like he will be moving my blast went through that moment the crowd gets louder he wont be able to stand now he took a lot of damage and it seems like he used up all his strength in the attack i just did now i confirmed my victory then a woman appeared in front of me who is walking very weakly she then stood right next to sairaorgsan it seems like shes saying something to him no one except me realises it am i the only one who can see her a ghost the ghost that couldnt pass away because of having regrets up the woman spoke clearly but with a small voice something shocking is happening right in front of me sairaorgsan moved a bit he then lifts his face up a face that was in bruises his eyes
are shallow but i can feel something strong within his eyes the woman then calls out to sairaorgsan sairaorg is thatsairaorgsans mother when i took a good look at her face it was sairaorgsans mother that i saw at the hospital it seems like sairaorgsan cant see his mother as well did she just send her consciousness she gets closer to sairaorgsan as if she is taking a look at her son she speaks in a voice that only i can hear it wasnt the cheer of a mother who is concerned with her son who is desperately fighting stand up stand up sairaorg sairaorgsans mother had a really noble and firm expression her voice wasnt that of a cheer but that of a mother who is scolding her son didnt you promise me that you will become stronger than everyone sairaorgsans body moved it certainly started to move his hands arms and legs moved making him lift his body fulfill your dream for the world you desire for the future of the underworld for not allowing others to taste the pain you felt isnt that the reason why you continued to hold tightly to your fist im not sure
if her words are getting through to sairaorgsan he probably doesnt hear her a world anyone can position themselves in a place with their ability and not where they were born from was that not the world you dreamed aworld where the children who are about to be born wont taste the feeling of being sad are you not going to create a world like that sairaorgsans mother made a smile while she started to disappear it was the face of a mother who is looking at a son she is proud of now go my lovely sairaorg you are my son it happened at that moment the man in front of me completely stood up from the ground while bleeding oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo the lion howled rooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooar that was the howl of a magnificent lion that sounded brave but also sad the arena shook violently even i was shaking fear shiver enchantment excitement all those feelings mixed inside me were making the cells in my body boil i can still fight with this man i can finish the fight with him just thinking about that brought out a power within me that spread through my whole body hyoudou issei i wont
lose there is a dream i need to fulfill sairaorgsan comes at me in a bruised and battered state i i also cant lose as well i went ahead while saying that both of our fist hit each others faces how many times have we punched each others faces now shit it certainly hurts he wont go down sairaorgsan wont go down no matter how much i hit him he continues to hit me while not losing the light inside his eyes all of his hits are something that feels like it will take everything away from me where where does he get this strength from even if i hit him in the stomach even if i hit him in the face the strong foe in front of me shows no signs of stopping his fist i will be taken down if i stop for a slight moment he will take away my consciousness then how can i make him lose consciousness how many times do i have to hit him to take him down the greatking who doesnt have the power of destruction this man in front of me is strong enough and an insanely strong foe even if
he doesnt have the same power as buchou and sirzechssamano i will be taken down immediately if i think about defeat vali is also a strong foe cao cao was also a terrifying opponent sairaorgsan is strong overall power speed and defence but there is a decisive difference between them a really obsessed thought about winning he will lose everything if he loses there is no second chance a resolution of accepting death a spirit where he can bet everything he has for his dream it seems like a strong will where he discarded the option of retreating is pushing him to go this far i only have this body i will lose everything if i lose everything i built until now will crumble for someone like me who didnt inherit the power of destruction this was the only path for me thats why i have to win with my body it looks uncool but this is my way of fighting you guys since i am unskilful you are cool you are awesome you are such a great guy that i cant express it in words thats why thats why i want to beat sairaorgsan i dont know how you
felt when you raised and piled up the status you currently have even so i wont feel sympathy towards you and continue hitting you fighting with my full power is my respect towards sairaorgsan and its my will this is my answer haahaa i also have a dream to makebuchou theking of the game i was about to lose the power of maintaining my armour even so i went towards sairaorgsan releasing my fist at him i willalso become a king one day i will become stronger than anyone i i will become the ultimate pawn bang my punch reached sairaorgsan its a punch that even i can tell was effective sairaorgsans body trembles but he doesnt fall one more time then but i finally lost the power to maintain my armour and my balancebreaker disappears shit it was close but i couldnt reach him my body also trembles but i went ahead with just my body with the remaining strength i have i will go like this this should be fine ican fight as long as i can grasp my hand when i was about to go ahead with just my fist sekiryuutei its alright now the lion located
at the chest of sairaorgsans body spoke my master sairaorgsama has the lion was shedding tears from its eyes sairaorgsan sairaorgsan is sairaorgsan has lost his consciousness while having his fist pushed forward as if he will be coming right at me he was still smiling even so his eyes were glittered with light and it still had the will to continue fighting sairaorgsama had already lost his consciousness since just a moment ago what then why did he try to come forward even so he was happy he kept on going forward as if he felt overjoyed he just went straight ahead because he was truly enjoying the fight while having his dream on the line the lion explains so he continued fighting with only his will even if he lost his consciousness yet he just went forward for his dream i had my head bowed down to him without noticing i then hugged his battered body i then shouted with a shaking voice thanks thank you very much sairaorg bael loses he retires this is the end of the game rias gremory teams victory the final announcement is made and the stadium became filled with the cheers of
the audienceemperor the emperor diehauser belial answered like this in front of the reporters it was a good match both groups will definitely position themselves in the top ranks as soon as they become professional i felt the coming of the new age after that interview one of the reporters questioned him if sairaorg bael ordered his pawn to take down rias gremory then wouldnt sairaorg bael have won the emperor answered his question with a passionate voice at that time in this stadium was there a choice like that what everyone wished for was the fight between the sekiryuutei and the greatking who doesnt have the power of destruction even a child would know that if that didnt happen noone would have been satisfied what else is there to it all of the reporters became silent at his answerlion heart when i woke up there was an unfamiliar ceiling this place is when i looked around i understood that i was laying on the bed with bandages on me rather than the wounds i was really exhausted it seems like there isnt the slightest amount of stamina left in me did i pass out after that looks like you
woke up a familiar voice when i looked beside me it was sairaorgsan wrapped in bandages sairaorgsan your bed was beside mine coincidently yes there should have been spare rooms possibly sirzechssama or viceroyazazel matched this room so we can have someone to talk to until we have our stamina recover hahahaha i wouldnt go so far as to fight you on the bed so i lost sairaorgsan says that not bad its probably my first time tasting acceptable defeat like this but i dont remember the last part of the battle i was here when i realised it me too to tell you the truth my memory is jangled up i just remember one thing it was the best fist fight i ever had certainly it was refreshing i was beaten to a pulp and i also beat you to a pulp weirdly im in a good mood we both smiled while having our bodies wrapped in bandages then a person entered the room excuse me a crimsonhaired man its sirzechssamasirzechssama ya isekun sairaorg it was truly a magnificent fight i very strongly feel that way and the other people at the top were all satisfied with it it
was certainly a fight that made me feel hopeful and look forward to the future of both of you sirzechssama sits in the chair nearby after giving a positive comment to both of us now i have something to tell you isekun sairaorg may i talk to him for a bit i do not mind do you want me to leave no i dont mind you will not suffer by hearing this sirzechssama says it with a serious face isekun there is talk about a promotion for you i couldnt understand what he just said but sirzechssama continues on to say it precisely there is talk about a promotion for you kibakun and akenokun all of you have fended off the attacks of the terrorists the terror that occurred at the bigthreefaction meeting the terror started by oldmaou faction you also have fended off the god loki this was also decided because of the incident at kyoto and the splendid fight you had today soon the three of you will rise up in ranking congratulations this is an irregular thing and a rare promotion that happened at this age sirzechssama says it with a happy face huh thats the only
thing i could say then i started to understand what he just said wawawait propropropromotion im getting a promotion eh you dont mean promotion as in pawns promotion right sirzechssama smiles at my questionthats how much you have accomplished theres still things you lack in but you are getting a promotion including the possibility you have in the future sairaorgsan then says it to me who still didnt get a grasp of this situation take it hyoudou issei you accomplished things for which you should receive this it doesnt matter where you were born or came from you are a man who should become the hero of the underworld even if you say that i sirzechssama also makes a bitter smile after seeing me confused um i will send the proper details to you next time i want you to get a promotion after receiving the proper courtesy we still need to decide the location of the stadium and proper details from now then i will excuse myself saying that maousama leaves the room sairaorgsan and i were left in the room even now i think this is still a dream becausebecause im getting a promotion well yeah it certainly
was my dream and it was what i was aiming for i never thought that something like this will come to me this quickly crap crap what should i do i dont know whats going on i was confused then sairaorgsan says to me the promotion is okay but right now whats important is rias you like her dont you rias that is a topic about buchou i can understand that immediately thats because i blurted it out in front of all those people ummmm yes i do love her then how about you tell her your feelings once again this time directly with only the two of you you already shouted out that she is the woman you have fallen for in front of all the crowd cecertainly i did but i just went with the flow at the stadium but it would be a different story if its just only the two of us i then spoke out nervously ii can have confidence rightif you couldnt then come to my place i will give you a cup of coffee to cheer you up and will listen to your story sairaorgsan thank you ii hes too kind that i
started crying i had a fist fight with this person with our dreams on the line i thought that i would want to have a drink of tea with him again in the futureindra after finishing the commentary for the game i azazel am walking towards the vip room i couldnt leave my seat because i was doing commentary but i received a call from my subordinate that the said person showed himself in the vip room vip rooms are all single rooms and there are many of them in the stadium it seems like all of them are used for this game the oldman odin is at the vip room for valhalla zeus and poseidon are at the room for olympus all of them are at their designated room with their guards i was walking towards one of the vip rooms and the said person came out of the room i was walking towards with his guards he has a buzzcut hairstyle and hes wearing circular sunglasses an aloha shirt and has a jewel around his neck the said person is wearing a rough outfit that wont be worn by someone with an important position well im not the
one who can speak about other peoples clothing though i then spoke to the said person akra well if it isnt akradono how was the game oh hey the fallenangel brother of justice it was a smoking hawt match for the fallenangel brother who is siding with the current maoufaction it was good that your student won the match right the gremory team that team has members that surpass common sense normal teams wont put up a fight against them he does speak with sarcasm like always hes a person with ultimateclass power among the entire factions in the world the emperor of heaven the warriorgod who defeated the godofbattle asura there was something i wanted to ask this emperorof heaven it has something to do with the incident at kyoto involving the terror done by herofaction there is something i want to ask you hahaha what is it fallenangel brother of justice if its me you want then i will gladly answer the longinus possessor you knew about cao cao before we did did you not i received a report from ise that son goku who serves akra knew cao cao yes this guy knew about cao cao since
he was a child he had contacts with the man with the ultimate holyspear somewhere at theplace we didnt know about akra then made a pleasant smile as if he meant something what about it what will you do is there any dissatisfaction if i knew him since he was a brat is it because i didnt report it or is itbecause i had contact with him such a cocky thing this bastard says he revealed it himself indra i called out that name with my voice filled with rage akra then smirked hahaha you seriously like to make it entertaining by calling me by that name dont make a scary face like that azaboy if you get pissed at something like that then what god of the dead hades is doing right now can change the whole map of the factions you know he knows about hades just how much does he know akra then points his finger at me i will tell you one thing youngster all of the factions are saying peace and negotiation but within their mind they are thinking that our mythology is the strongest other mythologies should just be wiped out you shit the
shittygeezer odin and shittyold man zeus are the only ones who dont think like that and they are nave after all its easy to gather the thoughts of humans if the god they believe in doesnt exist its common sense to think that other religions can just rot you know just how many gods do you think exist that fell so low because your religion invaded our territory and took away our believers and lowered the beliefs they had towards us by making us turn into myths you should just look back on each mythology gods are beings who are more honest with their grudges and hard feelings than humans you know i know that even if any of the mythologies and gods take the official stance of negotiation we cant tell what they are thinking deep within no its obvious that they are thinking of making their move if they see the chance but that official position is what is important right now if the powerbalance changes then the human world can get destroyed easily then akra makes a sigh well i will cooperate from the outside ophis and others are certainly a nuisanceophis and others huh hey akra
is cao cao also included in that others as well also send this message to that chichiryutei it was a great fight if you were to become a threat of this world then i will eliminate you along with your spirit the ones who can use the name heaven are already enough with us akra leaves after saying that akrahades it looks like this world will still continue to shake ophis the black snakes you are giving gathers powers it strengthens their powers it makes them get drunk on their own powers and is becoming a threat to the world your dream is making the world go into chaosnew life part 1 please line up in one row asia who is wearing a cute looking waitress outfit was making the students line up in the corridor its a really long line for the caf yes this is a fortunetelling and purification corner toujou konekochan and himejima akenosenpai will be doing the fortune telling and purification irina is next to the waitress and shes doing the advertisement for each corner on the day of the school festival the occult research clubs activity which uses the whole old school building is a
big success not only the guys who look up to the bishoujo of our club but also many girls have come as well even the local people are here man the girls in our club are super popular say cheese and the one who was taking a photo was buchou wearing a waitresss costume when we made a system where you can take pictures with the club members it became a hot topic right away taking a picture with the club member you like shows to be very popular well i dont get appointed though im just a lecherous student after all more than that buchou in waitresss costume looks so wonderful that tears are pouring from my eyes of course buchou is also one of the people you can take a picture with isekun dont just look and help me kiba shows himself from the classroom which became the haunted mansion yeah at this time i have to become the frankenstein for the haunted mansion i even put on make up for it gasper has the role of a dracula but instead of being scary he looks cute i have to go and help the caf so i leave
the trap to youyeah yeah its good that each corner is popular but all of us are going around various places if we have some spare time we have to help the busy corner now i should work hard as a frankenstein now oh female customers gaa i tried to scare them and jump in front of them but kyaaa its the hentai hyoudou we are going to be raped slap and i was slapped like that waa im a dracula i will bite kyaa gasperkun is so cute gasper who is a dracula is super popular with the girls shit ah i found hyoudou kill him before he does us slap i was slapped again by a female customer and this time it happened before i scare them why only me with this unfairness i received the 10th slap of the day part 2 that cant be so all the higherups who were supporting sairaorgsan withdrew at the ticket sales located at the end of the first floor using my time off i was talking to sensei its regarding sairaorgsan sairaorgsan lost his important connections in order to go to the top after losing to us yeah thats about
it it means that they arent kind people who would continue to gather around a loser didnt i tell you that devils are naturally the ones who are logical if there isnt any worth in it they will discard itthats cruel they really abandoned him like that for someone who fought so magnificently dont feel regret okay for you to worry about someone like him who was able to fight only with handtohand combat is something you shouldnt do you attained the best thing that is the world of the devils its a world where only strength has values if you are going into a world like that both you and rias need to make up your minds how about the seat for the nextheir for house of greatking that hasnt changed yet i dont know how the house of greatking will move but even if he doesnt have the power of destruction he is someone with that high calibre so they cant just reject him also because of how society will see it as well i see so the seat for the next heir for the house of greatking hasnt changed yet i feel a bit relieved we won
we conquered the game matches of the youth what we gained is something big but those who lost will lose something so is this the world of the devils then ah yeah there was something i wanted to tell sensei sensei i found this one possibilitythough i couldnt try it out this time kibas sacred gear is it something which has something to do with the new balancebreaker yes i also have that power which i gained afterwardsthe power of hakuryuukou so maybe perhaps yeah i think there is also a possibility for me as well i also was able to gain conversation with the albionsenpai from that match that is something which contradicts with your ability its also the direct ability to halve but specialising in that power will make your life in danger once again and if you were to activate it you might not be able to use the power of sekiryuuteithe sacred gear will respond to you the stronger your feelings are so it means it will depend on my training and imagination huh it will be a negative thing if i cant use the power of sekiryuutei while i use the power of hakuryuukou kibas
new technique was like that after all maybe doing something about it will depend on my imagination and adaptability there is also an option to make it a subspecies but will i be able to do it i feel uneasy about it but kiba was able to change it to a subspecies balance breaker so i would like to think there is a possibility next time i will resume my training with kiba just level it up carefully along with your imperfect truequeen it seems like you still have room for more growth yeah it starts from here the door was opened and the things inside were released i will keep on materialising my possibility when i was thinking like that the two idiots of matsuda and motohama appeared hey ise we cant enter any of the occult mansions damnall of the fortunetelling purification and caf queues have a long line ise as your friend cant you give us something like a vip ticket both of them come to me yeah the occult mansion for this school festival is still full with people thanks to that the line never ends well our club is filled with beauties and the handsome
guy kiba so many guys and girls come at this time i was selling out tickets the many tickets i had prepared sold out immediately and with ravels support we are preparing more immediately sensei also leaves after saying do your best then even though he is a supervisor for this festival i can only think that he is going around having fun isesama the new tickets are made aaah thanks ravelthe moment i took off the sold tag for the ticket counter the customers came saying one ticket please where were all of you hiding yes its for the fortunetelling correct well since ravel is enjoying it its okay isesama ravel says it while selling the tickets i was deeply moved by the match when i saw isesama hugging the opponent at the end i ended up crying she has her cheeks red wwhy is she acting like this all of a sudden yyeah hahahaha i was also heated up then i feel embarrassed when i think about it again i dont think so tthats right im thinking of making a cake for the end of the day oh ravels snacks taste good i will look forward to it
when i said it ravel puts her hand on her chin and says it daringly oof course its special after all yeah this is how ravel should act while i was thinking like that the number of customers increased umm can i please have a ticket for the purification i also need to sell the tickets properly ise is there like any secret shop or something my best friend where do i go for the ecchi photo shoot i should probably hit matsuda and motohama first part 3 so the sitrigroup had a flag battle thenyeah so we had to run around the field and i still cant get rid of my tiredness saji and i were having a conversation like that while walking inside the new school building it seems like saji was going around the school building to see how everything is going as his job as a student council member and he ended up meeting me and konekochan who were going around looking at the shops during the break time then we ended up talking about the games we had without realising it it seems like the sitrigroup who had a match against the agares at the
same time we had a match did a rating game which has the rule to take each others flags it seems like the dice figure you had was also hard hyoudou yeah we didnt have to go running around the field but the problem is who we have to send at certain matches man rating games sure are hard its the ambitions of the sitrigroup to build a school for rating games and sajis dream is to become a teacher there well that means nothing can go that easily and the match we got out of the school building i asked saji while buying frankfurter from one of the shops we won by a narrow margin since its a battle to take each others flags being strong isnt necessary for it but at the very end i turned into a dragonking and went berserk the battlefield turned into a horrible state and they say that we got bad ratings for it aaah i made trouble for kaichou saji drops on the ground while holding down his head ah so you went berserk since i wasnt there to control him it must have been hard to stop the berserked saji if
he ended up using it after being corneredhaa is it impossible for me to become a dragonking without hyoudou then aaah the male student over there doesnt it say not to sit on the flower bed im sorry hyoudou saying that saji headed towards the student who disobeyed the rules he sure works hard senpai lets do some shooting konekochan says that while pulling my legs yes yes lets do it okay konekochan if you beat me in shooting then i will buy you something dont forget those words okay i wont hold back well i ended up losing against konekochan so easily and i ended up buying her loads of things part 4 the school festival was now at its climax and there were camp fires on the school ground where everyone was doing oklahoma mixer right about now the guys and girls were having fun dancing i somehow managed to sell all the tickets and returned to the club room with a tired body i still hadnt lost all my fatigue from the baelmatch the truequeen had just awakened and so there were still blanks to its power up ddraig was saying that tuning will start from now
at this point getting used to the triaina will lead to the overall power up for the truequeen well from now on i will have to get used to it oh yeah sirzechssama and leviathansama were also here today they showed their faces and then were dragged by grayfiasan and kaichou i got into the club room we hadnt used the club room that much so it looked the same as usual there was someone inside there was someone sitting on buchous chair it was buchou she had changed from the waitress outfit to her school uniform ise buchou mumbled after seeing me good work ah yessince im in the 3rd year this will be my last year thats why i wanted to come back here for a bit ii see both buchou and i became silent after that battle both buchou and i became uneasy of course the reason wasi confessed my feelings in front of the whole crowd i still hadnt gotten a reply even i felt uneasy because we became like this every time we saw each other man it was so embarrassing when i tried to remember it even if i got into the flow i
couldnt believe i actually shouted out that she is the woman i love after that it apparently got on the newspaper in the underworld oppaidragon and switchprincess serious love romance that goes beyond master and servant seems like we cant go back to the underworld for a while if we do then the media over there will surround us hmmmm thats a bit troublesome then i remembered what sairaorgsan said to me how about you tell your feelings to her once more well theres no turning back now buckle up ise its true that i love this person more like i will say it the thing i wanted to say this whole time i have to call her with it this time for sure i swallowed my saliva took a deep breath and said it with a loud voice ririas eh buchou went blank for a moment and asked me again aaaah i will say it again then ii want to protect riasi want to protect rias for the rest of my life i am in love with you i love you rias buchou seemed like she had lost her words the next moment she started shedding lots of tears
oh crap i made her cry didid i fail my face became blue buchou shook her head and wiped her tearsno thats not it iim just so happy buchou walked towards me and started to pat my cheek you finally called me by my name i have waited for this the whole time i really did but i didnt have the courage to tell you so i thought that it would never happen but when i heard your feelings that time i was so happy i was so happy that i was about to cry during the match after hearing that i put up a weird face then that means then that means buchou nodded at my question are you serious iim going to bethis personsise i love you i love you more than anyone else buchou no rias lips were getting close to mine rias ise right as we were about to kiss bang a noise came from the door hehey dont push me xenovia it was irinas voice when i looked everyone in the club was peeping from the door what are you guys doing they were peeping they saw what just happened cocongratulations ise buchou now i
can hit on you without worrying about anything xenovia said it with a stiff voice uum congratulations both of you with this i can follow after oneesama you were looking as well asia ara ara with this i can now become serious at having an affair with isekun even akenosan the good part was about to start now correct what are you saying konekochan sorry i also saw it im so moved even kiba and gyasuke dont fuck around i can allow illicit sexual relationship just for today you knowthats none of your business rossweissesan i mean you are supposed to be a teacher i borrowed the kitchen so i finished making the cake ravel came in to the club room while bringing in a big cake from her action she was the only one who wasnt peeping huh did something happen everyone ravel twitched her neck and looked at us with a worried face rias who was next to me started shaking geez all of you this was supposed to be the most important scene in my life what will you do about it this is all your fault ise it happened because you confessed to me here eh
its my fault lets make it that way everyone also agreed with her bull shit with this the messy school festival and the battle against sairaorgsan ended its curtain now how long will my confession last forextra life the dream that doesnt finish and the dream that finishes i azazel am at the hospital located at the territory of sitri the guy with a good build who is looking at the flowershop located inside the hospital gets shocked at seeing me governordono hey battlingchampion its sairaorg i felt like seeing his face along with my report so i had stopped by this hospital since its a man who had a remarkable fight like that i thought of giving him my salutations sairaorg and i start to speak while walking down the hallway then our discussion moved onto ise and others how is hyoudou issei doing i made a big laugh at sairaorgs question and answered him yeah it seems like he confessed hahahaha ever since the school festival they act so innocent that its hard to look at them but the girls around them wont stay quiet like this so its going to start now his road to a harem
that is akeno asia and koneko will also get themselves further involved from here on how will they approach themselves knowing the relationship between rias and ise i dont think the aggressive approach of akeno who is aiming for the third spot will end instead will she get serious from now as ises affair partner and how will xenovia and irina who are after his genes make their approach now now how will sekiryuuteikun who isnt familiar with women act its something really amusing to watch from the sides i see thats good for rias that man suits her the best this guy also isnt in a position to worry about others so from the beginning aye sairaorg nods at my question the higherups from the greatking faction withdrew themselves as soon as they found out about his defeat sairaorg basically lost all ties that connected him to the top this is a rating gamedevils who are sensitive to the value of things discard things that are of no use to them immediately that is one of the points of how the devils business industry works yes there arent any problems im used to this our idiot is worried about
you ise was concerned about him it seemed like ise looks up to sairaorg please give him this message that i will catch up to him quickly a good smile even if he lost he still shows a refreshing smile if its this guy then he will be able to put a good match against ise and the others in a rematch im looking forward to it even from now then a person who seems like a butler appears in front of us while breathing violently sairaorgsama what happened the butler answers sairaorg with a shaking voice misurasama has doctors and nurses who gathered here had an astonished expression they were saying things like its a miracle or i cant believe it when i looked at the bed a woman who woke from her long sleep was looking at the scenery from the window sairaorg moves towards the bed while his body trembles making him drop the flowers he bought from the bottom floor then the womansairaorgs mother also realizes it hahauemother it is i sairaorg do you recognize me yes yes i do the mother tries to pat her sons cheek sairaorg caught her trembling hands with his big
hands my adorable sairaorg it seems like i was looking at your growth within my dreams you have become a splendid person hearing his mothers words a single drop of tears was shed from sairaorgs eyes i still have a long way to go hahaue lets go home as soon as you get better to that house i left the room because i thought i would be a bother staying here any longer you have become a splendid person hey sairaorg werent you fighting because you wanted to hear your mother say that this whole time even if i make a question like that i wouldnt know the real answer but i think that it doesnt change the fact that you are a proud son of your mother ise you are amazing you even made a miracle like this happen as well its you isnt it the one who made his mother wake up you did tell me that you came to this hospital and used bilingual on her i dont know what kind of effect it had on her but you made his mother awaken from a long sleep thats because its the only possibility i can think of
the pheromone to wake up sairaorgs mother that is an oppaidragon that brings about miracles hey ise i think that your idiocy is something that saves everyone you know how much will that idiocy work i still want to continue looking at it i looked at the sky of the underworld from the window a purple sky that doesnt change at all a hero of the devils and the descendants of heroes so which is the real hero thenafterword anime yes everyones support became reality and dxd is going to turn into an anime thank you very much please be alert at dragonmagazine or the official site for more information i will also be involved with the anime production in many ways as well its my first time experiencing this so theres many things i need to learn but because of it its a job worth the effort so like that buchous tits are going to shake on the television you bastaaaaaaards now finally in volume 10 rias and ise have started to call each other by their first names about 3 years have passed since this series has started he became a splendid person indeed the main character and
heroine who realised the feelings they have towards each other ise has grown once again well it isnt over for him who wishes for a harem and the girls who loves him its not being overboard to say that instead this is the beginning ise already has asia who is very important to him and there is also akeno who wants to become the candidate for being his affair partner im aiming to make a story where all the heroines can have a happy ending please support the noisy relationships between ise and the heroines kiba xenovia and rossweisse who strong even among the group have been tasting defeat continuously but its not them who are weak its just that their opponents were too strong akeno and rias are actually strong its just that their opponents were bad news the truequeen is also at an incomplete state the story is going to progress by ise becoming stronger by learning how to use it along with the triaina something like that now about sairaorg i wrote him as someone strong whom the gremory team has to overcome even during the story he was barely defeated with the four of them kiba
xenovia rossweisse and ise the longinus which has its own will the lion of regulus nemea it can turn both into a lion and a battleaxe the balancebreaker is a subspecies sairaorg mainly fights with his fists so he barely uses the axe form though also i couldnt explain it during the story but the last unused pawn piece remaining in the bael team is a mutation piece about the rating game this time i used a rating game with special rules originally i had a few special rules for the rating game several years ago but using the special rule all of a sudden might not be good so i started the game with normal rules first in this novel i was finally able to reveal one of the special rules there are other ones like scramble flag but i will usethat if another opportunity arises the actual battle is straight forward and a game should be like a game its not all that complicated and most of them are easy to understand i made the game rules to ensure the lives of the characters the topranker also makes his appearance emperorbelial riass goal right now they only appear
as a setting since it was a game of the youth which garnered so much attention i thought i should at least give their names out hence their appearance at this point i havent thought of any matches between them and ise and his group now for my thanks miyamazerosama and hsama who is in charge im in your care like always thank you very much to the both of you regarding the anime related cooperation volume 1 of the manga is currently on sales now as well i also have mishima hirojisan cooperating with me about the anime i will leave it to you for making the manga go along with the main novel and also a spinoff manga has started in the dragonmagazone this story here is basically koneko and asia as main characters the characters hiroichisan draws are very cute this is also a must see this time the story was smooth because it was about the inside of the devils industry well its an important volume about rias so sometimes this is good next volume is a story about a promotion test but not ending just like that is the gremory team and its also konekos

can see his lively face through the small communication magic circle yeah he its a she now i guess she is wishing for this im also interested in this so i want it to happen i received an unthinkable idea by vali to tell the truth this is something capable of changing the power balance of the world its you that we are talking about thats not the only reason right vali makes a bitter smile at my words you are as sharp as always that is also the reason why you are getting alienated from other factions its none of your business i heard that because you are going around being involved in things which isnt any of your business there are those that are thinking that perhaps this guy is plotting something correct well its true that i am being alienated from those standing at the top of other factions i already sound fishy because i have the position of being the governor of the fallen angels on top of that a guy like that is talking about having peace and negotiations i meddle too much with others business huh i was even told that by ise this
is my nature if someone was to attack me from the back then i will accept it i said it while making a sigh vali then mutters after he put on an astonished facethere are those who are after her of course there are obviously and there would be an immeasurable number of those at that but everyone is having a bitter time because no one can eliminate her that may be true but it seems like there will be those in our organisation who are hoping for the same thing no its about time they will make their move i get it i can grasp hold of the situation now a youth with that spear came into my mind are you trying to lure him out im just going to make it clear whether he is my enemy or not he said it daringly but you dont want him to be your ally either right well hes most likely an enemy its about time to settle this vali made a face with irrepressible delight see this guy is a battlemaniac after alllife 1 study and mating season part 1 this morning too my day hyoudou isseis started with a
battle on the bed when i opened my eyes i witnessed buchoui mean riasand akenosan glaring at each other both of them were already in their uniforms it seemed like they were fighting over the right to give me a morning kiss then rrias made a smile of confidence trying to give my ise a morning kiss well thats what i would like to say but since i was already spoiled by ise last night i will forgive you oh that seems to be something good that isekun looks like he has already done something amazing hasnt he akenosan said it while putting her hand on her mouth nno we didnt do anything that erotic since asia was with us as well we just kissed before going to sleep and cuddled each other while we were sleeping eh that was the same as usual you say no no it was something we did after i confessed to rias my tension rose so high that i was getting embarrassed and my heart was beating so fast i love that person and that person loves me both of us knew that so the kissing and cuddling now had an even greater impact
on us and also buchou i mean rias rias had begun behaving like a child the atmosphere of her oneesama aura was gone and the impact of it was so deadly i cant go to sleep if you dont kiss mene please kiss me hold me gently ise i love you she said that with a sweet voice and acted like a girl her age something like that was happening before we went to sleep i couldnt endure it anymore just remembering it made me feel excited i was so happy right then that i didnt know what was going to happen to me aaaah im so glad that i was born maousama especially beelzebubsama who invented evilpieces im so glad that i got reincarnated into a devil i will work hard for the underworld from now on by the way im still hesitant of calling rias rias well ive been calling her buchou the whole time so it couldnt be helped that im being hesitant of calling her by her nameand also the fact that i was feeling shy to call her by her name it was not that i didnt want to call her by her name instead
i wanted to call her by her name even more often i would like to at least call her rias naturally at home akenosan then sighed as if she found this boring looks like you are calmer than i thought rias i thought that you would have been burning with jealousy i dont find your reaction interesting at all im sorry about that but he is my ise so this fact will never change the unstable personality she had before the rating game was gone now shes filled with confidence just like before araara looks like i was shown the confidence of the legal wife akenosan said that rias made a small laugh then she kissed my cheek its breakfast come down stairs she said that and left the room it seemed like she wasnt that mad at akenosan even if she is acting like that shes pushing herself akenosan said it after sitting on the bed pushing herself bu i mean did something happen to rias to tell you the truth in the last rating game she felt that she was a burden to you because of the fact that she couldnt be of much use and it resulted
in her being like that she was talking about the match against sairaorgsan rias fought a longinus who had its own will regulus nemea and received a critical wound rias cant forgive herself because she held you back in the fight and is concerned about it nno its just that her opponent was too strong ririas isnt weak and she has also been making lots of strategies before the battle in terms of strategy the match between sonakaichou and agares received more attention the battle they had was a match of taking eachothers flag the scramble flag it wasnt a flashy fight so it wasnt recognised by others that much but it received a high rating from the critics as a hidden professional game if i think about it the magazine which was recently released in the underworld was talking about that match as well obviously the match between us and sairaorgsans team got more articles but the article written by a critic writer was ongoing about high praises for the match between sitri and agares rias will need to learn many things as a king first of all she asked for advice from her oniisama sirzechssama and has started
researching about the power of destruction even more seriously she asked about the power of destruction from sirzechssama is it different from training rias and sirzechssama have the same demonicpower the power of destruction but the natureor should i say the characteristic is different sirzechssamas power is said to be an ultimate wizardtechniquetype he can control that power like his hand or foot so his technique is said to be the best or second best amongst devils instead riass power is a wizardtype which is much closer to a powertype so you can say that she is blessed with power rather than technique but akenosan said it with narrowed eyes shes lacking something decisive to put it simply she doesnt have that one power up that destructive power that you call a certain kill move rias doesnt have a special move bbut if its just shooting i think it has quite an impact certainly buchou i mean rias rias might not have had a special move against the strong foes we have faced but it seems like shes finding it even i also had a shameful match akenosan said that with a sad voice i told her while shaking my
head no the opponents queen was quite skillful the queen from the house of abaddon who used the power of hole i heard that she is a toptier queen amongst the youth devils she musthave been stronger than raisers queen and the fukukaichou from the sitri group she must be very skillful since she could split the holylightning into the powers of light and lightning though isekun finished the match against her instantly uummmmm yeah that might be true i defeated her after getting pissed and using triaina though i reflected on my behavior from back then akenosan told me not to show triaina until the final moment but i used it right away i was enraged because my comrades were defeated maybe that was my current weakness if i cant be more composed in that type of situation i would become an unstable king in the future while i was thinking something like that which was very rare for me akeno chuckled i have to do something about myself from now on too but lets forget about that for now can you still not call rias by her name clearly yet uummm i can when i have to but
im not used to it and i also feel shy its not that i dont want to call her by her name but its just that i feel really shy about it those were my true feelings im really shy about calling her by her name but i actually want to call her by her name i wanted to say rias i love you akenosan then smiled oh my thank you for the good reaction then i will have to make you call me akeno as well and dont you think it would turn you on if we started an affair so soon after you had confessed aaaaffair akenosan who is obsessed with an affair she has been obsessed about it even before i confessed to rias its akenosan who is an s that we are talking about she must be having fun making rias get mad yes didnt i say that i would be a candidate for your affair partner since a long time ago my body is getting hot because i really want to start an affair with you akenosan began rubbing her body with her hands the whitethigh that was shown when she moved her body was
too bright for me akenosans body was so smooth and soft that my hands always sunk into her bodywhenever i touch her akenosan put her face closer to me and kissed my nose this will be enough for me in the morning ufufufu since asiachan has arrived wwhat i looked in the direction of the door after hearing akenosan say that asia was there with an apron on she was frozen like an ice sculpture while putting on a smiling face asiaaaaaaa why do you always come in at times like this asia upon seeing this situation jumped into my chest she then complained with teary eyes haaaaauuuu for me to get overtaken by akenosan i was also thinking about giving you a wakeup kiss you were asiachan had become so bold lately that even i was getting shocked she even started begging me for a kiss this definitely must be an influence received from buchou and akenosan then xenovia showed up what happened asia nng akenofukubuchou is doing her flirtatious actions early in the morning what did you say no you can do things like this from the morning irina also showed up and seemed shocked you guys came
as well the churchtrio was energetic even in the morning some time has passed since i confessed to rias what will happen to me from now on even though im feeling happy im also bewildered by their insane actions as well but im really feeling happy right now like that my crazy morning ended and i was now in the living room on the first floor it was time for breakfast having my mum as their leader most of the girls were helping her set up the table so today we were having fried eggs misosoup and salmon huh so a japanese menu then we have a rotation of japanese european and chinese food for breakfast all the girls work so hard in making them i always have my stomach filled with delicious food every morning i really am a lucky guy you know daddys favourite time is when we have food everyone is good at making food so they are all delicious women say the way to a mans heart is through his stomach you know what i mean right ise dad said that with a smiling face while eating the foodi do i really do understand dad i
nodded my head my daily dining was fun im surrounded by bishoujos i eat food made by bishoujos i eat while chatting with bishoujos it was an ideal life right this was the moment when i felt that it was great to be born as a guy this is your bento1 ise rias put a lunchbox in front of me while wearing a really big smile mum rias asia and akenosan rotate their shifts for making food for lunch konekochan xenovia irina and rossweisse mainly eat so they dont participate they sometimes go to the kitchen but they cant compete with the fourheavenly kings of the kitchen the fourkings are mum rias asia and akenosan especially asia who has something special in her cooking and is said to be the number one candidate for being passed down the taste of the house of hyoudou by my mum like that they rotate making the food for the lunch box but lately rias is the one making lunch for me apparently the girls decided to leave the cooking for me to rias rias also makes a bentobox for me every time with a really happy face the lunchbox always has food that
has been made with lots of care and has a heart mark on it and they always taste delicious it is the best ise getting a lunchbox that is only made by riassan you are doing well ise dad said that while nodding his head a lunchbox made from a belovingwife thats what i would like to say but matsuda and motohama also said did your wife make that bento by looking at a bento made by asia and akenosan as well so how should i put it maybe you would call it a bento made from the legalwife since im living in the hyoudous residence as well there might be a time when i have to show the cooking of my motherland rossweissesan said that while putting her hands on her chin her homeland what kind of food does valhalla have but i should be happy since the variation of food will increase while i couldnt get rid of my smile ravel came into my sight she was filling a lunchbox with food its not the lunchbox ravel usually uses whos is it oi ravel whos lunchbox is thatthis is a lunchbox for gaspersan it seems like hes doing
morning training by himself morning training gyasuke is i made a very shocked exclamation morning training by himself this is a shocking revelation rias then says this while taking a seat next to me in the last match he said he felt his lack of strength so hes doing his own training besides the training he does with you and yuuto gasper is doing basic training so it wont put pressure on his body the last match so the battle against the bael team it was something we couldnt talk about in detail because my parents were here then then akenosan continued gasper said he wants to master his strength and reach that stage for that he said he will train his body from the basics so he does muscle training and running in the morning he wants to reach that stage so he wants to attain balancebreaker for his sacredgear is that so so he was concerned about the last match that much but he fought very well he showed us that he is a man even so gyasuke couldnt forgive himself for his lack of power he is a guy after all i know how you feel gyasuke
being weak is something guys cant forgive themselves for i will also help him as much as i can as the guys of the gremory group gyasuke kiba and me have to be strong enough to protect the girls xenovia then said this with serious eyes yes he is a man he will definitely get strong the one who received the most support from gyasuke was xenovia the one who saved xenovia who was cornered by having her guard down was gyasuke but i dont want to imagine him being all muscular in my head i combined miltans body and gyasukes head i can imagine him being a creature from fist of the north star osu isesenpai i have attained the fist of a vampire when i mix protein with isesenpais blood it becomes good for my muscles look at these splendid biceps ooooooooosuwhat should i do if that happens well i dont think it would go that far but increasing your basic stats was a good thing even i can go around the battlefield in balancebreak state without having any stress on my body you need to start with body training and sprinting first konekosan you dont look so
well hmm ravel is looking at konekochans face just like ravel said konekochan doesnt look too well her face is a bit red and she looks like shes in pain is it a flu its nothing konekochan replied immediately even so ravel put her hand on konekochans forehead and looked worried but your face is a bit red is it a flu then i will make a special apple sorbet that has been passed down from the house of phoenix for you apples made from our familys territory have arrived from my house using that i will make it for you konekochan moves ravels hand and then says thats an unwelcome favor hearing that ravel got so mad that her drill hair started rotating nmaaa to reject the good intentions of other people cats must feel good because they can live how they want to i dont want to be told that by a bird brain like you bibird brain if i remember in japan bird brain is someone who forgets things right away correct it seems like you are studying very well so i will praise you nmaaa this catgirl hahaha the quarrels between these two have become a
daily thing as well they argue like this all the time but its not that they dont get along konekochan also helps ravel everyday and ravel also depends on konekochan they must be good fighting buddies im also having fun seeing konekochan acting like this while i was looking at them with a smile mum whispers into my earsby the way ise what is it mum i drank a cup of water then mum said it the same time when can i see my grandchild boooooooooooo the water sprinkled out of my mouth like a mist after wiping my mouth i responded in a high tone wha whwhwhwhwhwhwhat are you saying seriously what was this mother thinking you wouldnt normally come out of the blue and ask about a grandchild mum then said it with a serious face thats because in this house you call riassan rias so thats what it is isnt it i think my grandchild can also have a japanese name you know there are japanese names that dont sound weird even in other countries so by having a girl she could have a cute name like that for example eri or mari you already planned that
far ahead its early its too early for that what is she thinking im saying that its too early for a grandchild and their names i just confessed let me progress our relationship naturally just look at me and rias with warm eyes see everyone is looking at us and were laughing rias on other hand is really shy right now so much so that her face is really red iim really happy right now right now i dont care about a grandchild i only care about rias i said that strongly to mum rias then holds my hand iim also happy right now just being next to isemakes me really happy rias smiles at me with a red face rias iserias and i stared at each other what a magnificent woman im so happy that i could die because both of us are in love with each other aaah rias aaaah rias shes beautiful and cute this is what you call a bakauplebakacouple but try to act normal at school rossweissesan stated calmly while drinking coffee she turns into a teacher at times like this konekochan is staring at me and rias she then looks down grandchildbaby happiness she
says that with a low voice she doesnt look too energetic is there something wrong with konekochan part 2 that day the ones who arrived at my house late at night were important people like sirzechssama grayfiasan and azazelsensei they were gathered in the vip room located on the top floor of the hyoudou residence they gathered us the gremory team with serious faces so we knew that it had to be a serious discussion sirzechssama made me kiba akenosan and rias sit in front of him and then began to speak just as i told the three of you last time isekun kibakun and akenokun have accomplished many achievements so the topic about you three getting a promotion has been decided by us the yondaimaou and the other top council members hes talking about that yes it seems like a discussion was going on about a promotion for me kiba and akenosan he told me about it after the match against sairaorgsan at that time i was confused so i couldnt understand what he was talking about thats because its a promotion we are talking about something i couldnt even image was said directly to me by maousama so
it would be weird if i wasnt confused my aim was to get a promotion but i never thought i would obtain one this soon it seems like fighting against the evilgod loki and khaos brigade have become great achievementswell we mysteriously got involved in those matters and getting through those incidents has become a big achievement apparently certainly i thought that we should get praised for surviving such a crisis where it wouldnt have been weird for us to have lost our lives but i never expected that we were thought so highly of that we would be given a promotion about the promotion it would be natural that you three should get a promotion to highclass devils by skipping the middleclass devil exam but because of the promotion system we would like you to go through the middleclass devil exam first middleclass promotion test wait highclass we are thought to be at a topclass devil level are you serious highclass really i really cant understand whats going on right now akenosan and kiba are also shocked but not as much as me it seems like i was the only one making weird faces azazel sensei said this while
drinking sake from a glass it wont be weird for ise kiba and akeno to become highclass devils judging from your achievements but it seems like there are steps even in the world of devils especially the higherups are noisy about it they acknowledged the special promotion for you but they are also saying to follow the proper procedures thats why you will become middleclass devils and be active in that rank for a while then soon after you will receive a promotion to become highclass devils from them you guys can plan about what to do when you become highclass devils during your time as middleclass devils sensei said that as if this is something easy mimiddleclass and hihighclass devil yoyou are telling me that i have the right to become one i asked because i felt like i was not worthy of this award my true feelings were that i didnt know what to do after getting a promotion because my dream is right in front of me sirzechssama then nods with a smiling face yes defeating the evilgod loki and the terrorists are big achievements and you have shown magnificent fighting skills in the last match against
bael even more than that isekun you are the popular chichiryuutei oppai dragon it wont be weird if the topic of promotion comes to you no i should say that this is an expected resultso that show was also the reason for it how can this be i thought that was just a profitmaking plan done by the house of gremory recently a sponge called sponge dragon was released i think that the house of gremory is a business family because they even make products for things that occurred in the match against bael congratulations on your promotion recommendation ise akeno yuuto all of you are servants that i can be proud of i am really blessed rias smiles with a satisfied face it seems shes deeply pleased she must be feeling great joy because her proud servants received such great acknowledgment isesan kibasan akenosan congratulations yes its good news you guys are comrades i can be proud of devils middleclass promotion im very interested in it the churchtrio asia xenovia and irina are also pleased with us ii also want to improve just like senpai gyasuke also gives us a positive comment this guy has become really positive hes
brighter than before i also want to get a promotion quickly and have a stable and luxurious living rossweissesan has a realistic dream like always this team has become a group where raiseroniisamas group cant compete against anymore ravel says yeah i dont feel like our current team would lose to raisers team the oldestson in the house of phoenix is a top player in rating game his team has a goodbalance sensei says so hmm the house of phoenixs oldest son eh my oldest brother is the next heir of our house we will be troubled if he isnt strong putting that aside this is something great to be expected from riassamas servants for three people to get a promotion in such a shorttime isnt it so konekosanravel asks konekochan of course congratulations isesenpai yuutosenpai akenosenpai konekochan shows her smile but she seems to have low tension though it seems like shes pleased with our promotion though soon other guys beside these three will also receive a promotion as well what you guys did is really magnificent in terms of power basically everyone is at a highclass devil level having servants like that in one group is very rare
sensei says that i see so the other members also have a chance to get a promotion hes right it would be weird if we are the only ones to get acknowledged when all of us went through those intense battles the fact that all of us went through death situations is the same akenosan and kiba stand up and bow to sirzechssama thank you very much for the promotion recommendation this is a great honor which is too great for me sirzechs lucifersama i will take this promotion as a knight of rias gremorys group i will also accept it as the queen of gremorygroup i thank you deeply for acknowledging me for this promotion kiba and akeno accepted the recommendation professionally how about you isekun sirzechssama asks me i also stood up and bowed my head down to sirzechssama i will take it of course thank you very much to tell you the truth im still shocked because its something that i only dreamed about but i would like to overcome it for my dream im satisfied that i was able to live up to ribuchous standards oh it might be rude to call her by her name
in front of maousama thats what i thought but sirzechssama made a naughty smile and then said oyaoya isekun you can call rias by her name even in front of me no buti tried to stay humble towards him but sirzechsama continues happily hahaha more like im telling you to call her by her name im also happy and looking at you two makes me feel at peace ggeez oniisama please dont play with us rias stood up with her face red and was mad at him aaah she sure gets mad with a cute face hahaha why not right grayfia sirzechssama asks grayfiasan grayfiasan speaks with the usual cool atmosphere someone like myself has no right to say anything however i dont think its bad to call each other by name in a situation like this what even grayfiasan evengrayiaoneesama even rias will become silent if grayfiasan says that sirzechssama nods his head yes yes and i dont mind you calling me aniue2 now call me that isekun call me oniichan slap his head was smacked violently by grayfiasans harisen3 sirzechssama you are going overboard in a situation like this one day it will be alright if he calls
you that next time yyou are right maybe rushing things is the bad part of the males in gremorycough sensei who was laughing at the scene besides them says it after taking a breath so like that next week the three of you ise kiba and akeno will participate in the middleclass devil promotion test in the underworld the test is earlier than i expected next week thats all of a suddenkiba says that akenosan continues after him if i remember correctly the test for middleclass promotion test includes writing a report a writing test and a practical correct putting the practical aside i wonder if we will be alright with the report and writing test theres a report oh man it even sounds like there is a writing test will i be able to do it i begin to get nervous sensei then says dont worry if its a writing test then akeno and kiba will have no problem its basic knowledge and application problems for devils and also questions relating to the rating game so its not something new for the report what do they have to write about sensei asks grayfia grayfiasan took a step forward and
explains the report that has to be submitted on test day can be broken down to what will you do when you become a middleclass devil and write about your aim and greed as a theme its also popular to include about what did you gain until now in it as well i see so we have to write about our aim and what we have gained till now hmmm i dont think i can write anything complicated so i wonder if i can write about something clear and simple but a report somehow it seems like a test in the human world when i said that sensei looks at sirzechssama and spoke well they are using it as a model i guess sirzechssama nods the majority of the devils taking the middleclass promotion tests are reincarnated devils because of that we use the tests in the human world as a model and apply it on the promotion test i see if i think about it that would be the case lately there are lots of reincarnateddevils so the ones taking the promotion test would mostly be former humans so they decide the test by thinking about that then sensei
bangs on his knees and then looks at us anyway the report will be due on the test day so have that as your first priority but ise yyessensei points at me and then says besides the report you on the other hand have to study for the writing test rather than the common knowledge train your brain in a week so you can answer application questions rest assured there are intelligent girls and guys around you rias puts her hand on my shoulder leave it to me ise i will teach you lots of things isekun i also want to check through the questions so lets study together araara then i will also study together as well kiba and akenosan also say that to me ooh what a strong support having rias and akenosan makes me feel reassured already but the goodlooking guy also wants to help me what people need are good friends but then what about the last one ummm then what about the practical when i say that sirzechssama grayfiasan and sensei made a weird face and looked at each other i dont think you need to worry about that sensei says it as if its
an obvious answer eh but in my case its something i can gain the most points in so i was thinking about training for it i said that but sensei waves his hands to the sides thats why im saying that you dont need it just do the practical in the test day you probably wont realise it until the test day akeno kiba you guys also dont need to worry about the practical so concentrate on the report yes yes akenosan and kiba both reply that eeeeeeeeh both of you are alright with that are you serious so i have to study for the writing testrather than the practical in which i can earn the most points in well in my case it seems like i wont get good marks for the writing test so studying for it is a must even so i wanted to train for the practical if i couldnt do anything for the practical on the test day then that would be a great loss i put my hand up because i felt nervous ummm one last thing i know its a really embarrassing thing to ask but what would happen if i fail in
it would we lose our recommendation sirzechssama shook his head no that wont happen once you receive a recommendation you will not lose it even if you fail the test next week you can redo it as many times as you want you wont lose your recommendation unless you receive a very bad result oh is that so that makes me feel better so i can do it again even if i fail next week unless i start a weird crime this promotion requirement makes me feel very safe i felt assured and sirzechssama says it strongly also i know that you will pass in next weeks test isekun isekun you might be feeling uneasy because of the sudden recommendation but theres nothing you have to worry about i received praise from maousama is it true can i actually pass it but i received a recommendation i will live up to their expectations and i will take the test and getting a promotion was supposed to be my aim it happened while i was doing things without thinking but this is an important chance i will just go ahead and pass i will do my best i will definitely become
a middleclass devil and one day i will become a highclass devil i replied by raising my spirit yeah the road to becoming a haremking has opened i will just go ahead and be covered in naked women bodies gufufufufufufufu i was burning with ecchi dreams within my mind as rossweisse stands up now since the discussion is basically finished i will take my leave when i look she has clothes on that seems like shes going somewhere it has been bugging me the whole timerossweissesan are you going somewhere when i asked rossweissesan answers while looking far ahead to northen europe im thinking of returning home for a while northen europe returning home whats this about i didnt know what was going on but rias seems to know about it its about that correct rossweissesan silently nods at riass question yes currently i think im lacking power there are many occasions where the gremory team fights strong opponents at this rate i will become a hindrance im thinking about increasing the trait of rook so shes going back to increase her rooks trait sensei then asks her rossweisse is there something you can rely on in valhalla yes there
is a senpai of mine who is a professional in that department it seems like getting points at magicalattacks during the valkyrie candidate test has been in vain after the battle against bael it seems like there were things rossweissesan was concerned about and she has been regretting that she couldnt give it her all even if i say that i think she left a good impression in the last match she defeated two of the servants from the bael team and she even made sairaorgsan flinch because her magical attack went through magic and demonicpowers are similar but different demonicpower is a power that devils use with their own power to create natural phenomenons it needs lots of power to turn imagination into materialization to make complicated or powerful demonicpowers into materialization it requires a high technique to control them magic on the other hand makes law of supernatural phenomenon occur by controlling it with rules and formulas by deploying the magiccircle calculation becomes an important factor so you can calculate the rule and formula every time to begin with magic was originally a power so other beings besides devils could use demonicpowers by their own law and formula
thats how it started but now variation types of magic were created and it can do things that the demonicpowers of devils cant do obviously there are demonicpowers that cant be used by magic especially the ability and powers handed down by the puredevils genes those are powers that canonly be used by those from their clans like that magics and demonicpowers are powers that are similar but different the power that uses magic is called magical powers or power of buddhism well thats what i was told from sensei and rossweissesan so even i know basic information about magic though i dont know anything more than this sensei then says it looking at the balance of riass team it would be good to have someone who uses magic it might have been good to use a bishop or pawn to increase her strong points riass team has overwhelming firepower but looking at it as a whole it has shallow defence and can easily be taken down by tricks and techniques in the past games and actual battles the opponents aimed for those in other words the whole team has muscles even in their brains something like defeat them before
getting defeated covering those parts with magic would be a good thing everyone made a bitter smile at senseis comment rias is also embarrassed and she has a red face wwell his opinion is correct most of us are types who just go head on and fight and we get toyed with by techniquetypes often sirzechssama then says this but there are many fans that prefer teams like your group strategytype teams and techniquetype teams are hard to judge at first glance and lack extreme fights but expert fans like them sensei also nods yeah so rias and sairaorgs teams should use their flashy fights to attract an audience while improving their strategies that way in the future the professional games will be heated up oh so you can also look at it that way so professionals also need to get an audience as well i see either way you need certain support to back up those powers so will it be alright to send rossweisse to valhalla rias sensei asks rias yes if there are certain areas they want to improve then there is no reason for me to decline it rias also agrees with it seeing that rossweisse
gives her gratitudethank you very much ah i have also made the test paper for the midsemester test so please dont worry about it rias and akenosan nod at rossweissesans words to be expected from her oh now i remember its about time at the academy for the midsemester test thats right its about time that there is a midsemester test at school for 2nd years we have sportsfestival schooltrip schoolfestival and midsemester test continuously for the second semester oh crap theres the midsemester test i didnt study at all i got up and screamed what should i do what the heck should i do im already dumb to begin with and on top of that a test its going to be the worst day ever but it will also be bad not to take the promotion test looks like my school life that is mixed with troubles will continue till the test day while i was holding my head down sirzechssama asks ravelravel will you accept the earlier discussion i talked about of course sirzechssama ravel accepts his offer huh what is this about what is this thing about an earlier discussion i ask sirzechssama yes im thinking of
making ravel become isekuns assistant in other words a manager ah if i think about it sensei also said something like that before the bael match sirzechssama continues isekun will also be busy from now on both in studies in the human world and the entertainment industry in the underworld grayfia manages the schedule for the gremory team but shes still just one person so matters that she cant handle by herself will appear especially in simple matters so i thought it would be better to give you a manager from now on thats why i picked ravel who is connected with the underworld and is also studying in the human world so my support i heard sensei saying that i would need someone like that from now also by seeing the number of children who came to cheer for me at the bael match i can imagine how things related to oppai dragon are important from the high popularity of oppai dragon in the underworld thats probably the reason for me getting a manager i feel like a celebrity wait am i a celebrity in the underworld hmmm i dont feel like it but i do know that im
famous its scary to know that the my importance is increasing in ways i dont know about im sorry for bringing this up all of a sudden but i want you ravel to support isekun with his midclass promotion test ravel stood up at sirzechssamas words and put her hand up filled with confidence i understand leave it to me ravel phoenix i will definitely make sure isesan gets promoted i will collect and gather the essential books and such now saying that ravel leaves the room oh shes filled with spirit having her on my side makes me feel strongfor ravel your promotion will affect her future life greatly thats what sensei says just like her parents from house of phoenix she seems very interested in my promotion koneko if you let your guard down the senpai who you greatly love will be taken away by ravel sensei picks on konekochan hohold on if you talk about those kind of things konekochans heart will get heated towards the rivalry she has against ravel konekochan was just looking down and it seemed like her mind was elsewhere everyone seemed puzzled at konekochan who didnt react at all konekochan is acting
weird just like i thought i hope she isnt ill im worried about konekochan but i have to take care of the test first the promotion test and midsemester test these are two problems that are greatly pressuring me part 3 its a few days later its lunch time and i am lying on my own desk inside my classroom i held my head down while i mumbled aaaah there are too many things i need to memorise the timing was bad during the sportsfestival there was the incident with diodora and oldmaou faction before the school fieldtrip there was the incident with loki and at the fieldtrip there was the battle with the herofaction and at the same time as the schoolfestival there was the rating game against sairaorgsan and for the promotiontest there is a clash with the midsemester exam and studying its not easy being a devil every night after the devils job and dinner there is a group study session for the exam im studying for the midsemester test and promotiontest while being taught by others i have to study for both so it feels like myhead is going to blow rosweissesan departed from japan soon
after that she finished setting the testpaper so she must have gone to northeurope without any worries i also wanted rossweissesan to check my study progress as well during normal daily life she teaches me for studies and other things regularly oh look ise is studying its useless even if you feed your brain you are already a dumbass to begin with so it wont do any good motohama and matsuda appeared and came to my desk with lecherous faces shut up baldy and glasses putting motohama aside you have the same grades as me matsuda matsuda just laughed it off kakaka at times like this you should just forget about these kind of things and put your attention to other things look what matsuda pulled out wasa porno dvd this is the lecherous porno dvd for gentleman i grabbed it from matsuda immediately i glared at the cover of it tthis is the really rare and popular dvd which is hard to get now true bigbreasted squadron paiotsujya the exploding exposed breastwar story yyou got your hands on thissss motohamas glasses sparkled at my shivering voice well i got it from my personal connection i sacrificed many things to
get my hands on this even so this has that much value to it matsuda puts his arm around my neck he then whispered into my ears with a lecherous face hey isedono lets forget about the test and have a filmparty at my house your house is cramped with girls so you cant watch these types of things can you hhes exactly right i couldnt do personal and private things at my house like before especially touching ecchi stuff has become a valuable thing i spend my nights with rias and asia and other girls often cometo my room to play as well we often have sudden game tournaments in my room well that is also really fun people might say that even if i cant touch erotic things womens bodies are close to me but that is that and this is this i want to watch lots of porno how can you call it a youth if a healthy high school student like myself cant watch porno okay we will watch this porno dvd at matsudas house it happened when i had made up my mind and was about to speak someone took the dvd i was holding
away from me its the girl with glasses its kiryuu araara its just before the exam and the the threeerolechers are just like usual ara but this looks interesting what do you think asia right next to kiryuu is assssssssssssia asia looks at the cover after being told by kiryuu her face suddenly turns red hauuuuuu isesan yyou got naughty things like this again you already have so many how much does asiachan know about my collection the girls at my house have a strict observation of me also guys always search for new stimulating things xenovia also appeared and started to look at the cover with very interested eyes yes last time i watched one of ises collection with asia and irina but i think what they do in the end is always the same intercourse right isnt that right irina xenovia shifts the discussion to irina who appeared beside her wait you guys were watching my collection what the hell rriassan and akenosan also said that the step and atmosphere are important as well thats what it means hmn atmoshere huh you certainly need it so you are saying that just making love wont allow us to be
satisfied like we are women thats what you mean right irina wait dont shift the topic like this to a christian like me something terrible will happen but i do have an interest in it aaaah please forgive this complicated mind of a maiden of mine lordshe holds her head down and she then prays irina sure is busy like usual wait have rias and akenosan been looking at all my collection as well the way i hid it was perfect i hid it inside household goods inside the closet located in the unused room so it was found the location of the dvds didnt change and there wasnt even a trace of them being touched im feeling embarrassed because my private things were revealed matsuda and motohama both said aaaah while having a small laugh and they are looking at me with sympathetic eyes shit im envious of you guys who can watch porn without any care inside your room i will also be erotic so dont worry isesan asiachan made a declaration like that next to her kiryuu had a suspicious smile on her face youuuuuuu even kiryuu influenced asia with erotic things if my cute asia becomes
erotic then i maybe that will be quite good then my mobilephone vibrated when i took it out and looked it was the vibration to alert me of the time ah its time for medicine i said that and got up from my seat huh was there something wrong with you matsuda asks no its not for me sorry i will be gone for a bit i said it to everyone and moved to a place where there arent any people i went inside the home economic room that isnt used by anyone during this time i made my gauntlet appear immediately and took out a small bottle at the sink i sprinkled the fluid inside it to the jewel how is it ddraig yeah it feels like my feelings are getting relaxed ddraig seems to have calmed it seems like ddraig got a heart disease because i have been powering up with breast related things continuously when i showed ddraig to the professional counselor introduced by sensei i was prescribed to use this medicine he has his conscious but apparently a sealed dragon is a special existence so i used the medicine for dragons that will calm their stress
down to test it and it seems like themedicine worked and he seems to be more relaxed than before a dragon sealed in sacred gear should be rare but a medicine used for that kind of dragon seems more rare to me i really am troubling ddraig so much that i had to get a counsellor to check up on him i never imagined that a heavenly dragon had a fragile heart so i did too much reckless powerups i started get back to myself after receiving the medicine kukuku but a heavenlydragon who needs medicine what would the whiteone think if he finds out ddraig is laughing at himself im really sorry well anyway i have a counsellor look at ddraig once a week and i have to use this medication on him 3 times a day ddraig i will look after you for the rest of my life kukuku medication for ten thousands years huh thats why im saying that im sorry keep your heart strong oh if the cause which is me tells him that then it wont have any persuasive strength in it the thing about ddraig is serious but i also have to take care
of the two tests im busy with other things besides battles as well so it was necessary that i got a manager huh i seriously am having a crazy high school life haaa i got out of the homeeconomic room while making a sigh and i met him by chance hyoudou ah saji i met with saji you were making the heavenlydragon cry that much saji makes a sigh after hearing about the issue with ddraig i was in the studentcouncil room if the heavenlydragon doesnt stay stable then serious things will happen when vritra goes berserk saji says it while drinking greentea it means that dragons are sensitive and hard to control i said something that sounds right but im not in the position where i can say that but saji also agreed by saying yeah you are right well itshard to take care of a dragon that resides in you i wonder how sensei is interacting with fafnir i should ask him about it next time oh yeah i heard that you were recommended for promotion congrats i received congratulation from saji yeah thanks it was all of a sudden to tell you the truth i still cant
believe it well i think it is an appropriate recommendation you went through lots of life and death situations right i participated in the battle against loki and the battle at kyoto so i understand it you will die at battles like that normally you would die how many strong foes have you had as your opponents they are all opponents who come from mythologies or are recorded in history but i still survived through those battles its all because of ddraig and my comrades who i can depend on even so it was an intense battle seriously why do we get involved in those kinds of battles i admire a quiet and ecchi lifestyle saji continues you survived through those battles and achievements so i would say its an appropriate thing are you going to skip through ranks dont you guys already have the power of highclass devils already like you and kiba for example no in terms of promotion we have to become middleclass devils first hmm so the higherups dont have the good will to do whats right ay kaichou said that you kiba and akenosenpai have the power to become highclass devils by skipping through ranks
since its sekiryuutei holydemonic swords and holylightning some people look at us like that even sensei and others said its a matter of time until we become highclass devils so we accomplished things where we get treated like that huh you and kiba are especially crazy strong i asked kiba to spar with me last time he was too strong my attacks couldnt hit him that much kiba is like a rolemodel of a techniquetype in my opinion and you have been training with kiba every day right you do know that you guys are monsters righti dont want it to be said by saji who can transform into a dragonking well the training with that guy wont mean anything if i dont do it seriously i see so saji did spar with kiba he must have bit his tongue when he saw kibas god speed my attacks seriously cant touch him i also want to get a promotion but before that i need to get stronger saji says it with a bitter smile you are pretty strong enough you do have the dragonking vritra with you no not just me i want to get stronger with the other sitri
member as well lately our kaichou has been dicussing it with grigori about the artificial sacred gear that is artificial sacred gear the one sensei uses the one he created for himself by copying the scared gear system that the god recorded in bible used to create the sacred gear yeah we the sitri group often participate in the experiments of azazelsensei as a result next time one of the nonsacred gear possessors of our group is going to be equipped with an artificial sacred gear wow thats amazing even if i say artifical sacred gear the power output isnt as stable as the sacred gears and there are limits on the number of times they can be used there are many things that still need to be fixed but its certain that we can become stronger so it wont be in vain if we use it and if the research on the artificial sacred gears improves then in the near future it will become the power for devils as well also reverse isnt used anymore the burden it has on the body is large and they say those with sacred gears near them might touch them and bad things
might occur so the studentcouncil members are helping with the experiments for things like that huh saji enjoyably talks about it there are also lots of variations in artificial sacred gears as well its not like im receiving it but its fun to know about them you know it begins with power or support type for types it has elementtypes countertypes barriertypes and like that it has many variations and just like our sacredgears there are ones that have monsters sealed in them even by contract as well if i remember correctly senseis artificial sacred gear has one of the five dragonkings gigantis dragon fafnir residing in it by contract do you call those ones the contractsealed type perhaps im really lacking in knowledge of sacred gear types i only try to understand my own sacred gear next time i should ask sensei to teach me about it when i was thinking about it other sitri members came into the studentcouncil room ah its hyoudoukun the one with pig tails the bishop kusakasan congratulates me by saying congratulations for your promotion recommendation as soon as she sees me other members also congratulate me by saying congratulations thank you first of
all i will try my best for the test the firstyear girl the pawn nimurasan says it to saji genshirousenpai kaichou said to get that document ah that roger that nimura and another girl the secondyear girl bishop hanakaisan says it to saji genchan i also have some business from kaichou are you serious hanakai looks like i have lots of things to do first of all lets do the ones that are easier to finish hyoudou i will be going then just relax by talking to the others saji leaves the room with hanakaisan and nimurasan after saying that i heard from the rook yura and bishop kusakasan that the second year girl the bishop hanakai momo and the first year girl the pawn nimura rurukosan are having an intense clash over saji hanakaisan was the girl who was carrying the pack with my blood inside at the rating game against sitrigroup nimurasan is the one who got defeated by konekochan hanakaisan was originally kibas fan but apparently she is the type who can distinguish between dream and reality and she realised that kiba is someone who she can not reach so she had her heart taken by saji
who continued to work hard nimurasan on other hand has been beside saji and has been supporting saji with studentcouncil work and devil related works because shes been right next to him she apparentlyfell for saji who takes everything seriously looks like hes also busy while i was thinking about my friends lovelife while drinking green tea the rook yura came up to me with autograph paper hyoudou can i have your autograph okay but are you sure you want mine of course the battle against bael i saw the recorded video and became deeply moved by it that was the best fist fight ever yura seems to be my fan last time there was a discussion about who the girls types are amongst the devils attending the school of me kiba gapser and saji when i talked to yura and the others she told me i was her type she said she likes guys who seem to be covered in mud am i muddy well i always have fist fights so it cant be helped if i have an impression like that but yura sure is a bishoujo even though she has really high popularity from girls for having
a bishounen face by the way the knight megurisan prefers gasper she seems to like younger boys young boys are good megurisan says it naturally with a serious face i definitely prefer kibakyuun kusakasan is a big kibafan like always also the fukukaichou tsubakisenpai is also kibas fan in terms of being a fan tsubakisenpai is greater than kusakasan apparently she fell for kiba after losing in the game at the underworld is it that love where the person finds out their feelings after they have lost kusakasan do you want me to introduce you to kiba next time kusakasan gets overjoyed at my suggestion really but can you introduce tsubakisenpai first she is seriously in love with kibakyuun ah is that right its one of those complicated relationships between senpai and kouhai wait why am i being concerned about that goodlooking guy but that guy doesnt have a girlfriend even though hes popular amongst girls thats why im being concerned as his friend like this i was openingup to the people from studentcouncil this is a good thing its a good thing to have connection since we are the few devils who go to same school so hyoudoukun is
here i see i heard a familiar voice when i turned around it was sonakaichou ah im pardoning myself yes kaichou answers my greetings with a cool manner the guest is here but i want everyone to do an errand for me tsubaki is having a hard time against the clubs yes everyone replies to kaichous order see you later hyoudoukun saying that everyone leaves the room the only ones left are me and kaichou its probably my first time being alone with kaichou im getting nervous then the room suddenly becomes silent sonakaichou sat on her seat and started looking through the documents i felt like i was in the wrong place so i tried to leave then kaichou spoke i heard that you confessed to rias so you want to talk about that ri did buchou tell you yes i have been friends with her since we were small lately i hear about her love life by communicating through magiccircles are you serious ththat sure is hahaha ummm yeah i put on a smile and kaichou looks at me with a straight stareit seems like you can do everything that i couldnt do what do you mean the
engagement the incident with raiser the case with kiba yuutokun the case with gasperkun the case with konekosan the case with akeno you made the burden that rias carries lessen i have been beside rias longer than you yet i couldnt do anything even though im her friend because im a highclass devil because its the devils custom i couldnt overcome these obstacles because i was captured by those facts i couldnt do anything because of the place i stand at and the way people around me will look at me sonakaichou has been thinking of rias in her own way of course since they have been friends since they were small you solved them without thinking about those facts i was very happy about it and i was also very jealous about it you can solve every problem that i couldnt thats why i want to give you my gratitude thank you for saving rias kaichous cool expression loosens after making a sigh hyoudoukun no maybe i should call you isekun at private times please take care of rias she can be stubborn and short tempered at times but shes more delicate than anyone she needs someone who can
support her by her side thats why i want to leave this task to you yes leave ribuchou to me of course rias is very important to me you can call rias by her name when its only us two if you are the person she is in love with then that makes you my friend as well yes you can also call me sona ii think thats a bit hard for me kaichou made a sigh after hearing me you receive dissatisfaction from rias and akeno about how you speak to them at private times dont you eh hhow do you knowis kaichou a psychic how did she know seeing my reaction kaichou makes a small laugh i thought that this person makes a cute laugh shes usually cool so the gap between it makes me fall for it i see i can understand why saji fell for her it means gentlemen who can separate the way they talk to ladies are more wonderful hahaaaa so its like that kaichou made a sigh and slipped some words from her mouth maybe i should also get a boyfriend oh i just heard a new word how about saji my suggestion
does he have any chance kaichou shook her head i would call him my littlebrother perhaps also there are servants of mine who have feelings towards him so i wouldnt think of laying my hand on him ah looks like there isnt any chance right now saji it seems like your dream is far away also about the game it was magnificent for you to defeat that sairaorg bael your growth sure does astonish me yyes thank you very much but we were able to finally beat him with four people he was a strong foe even so it was your teams victory i can only say it was splendid shshe sure does praise me a lot this feels very new to me but kaichous group is also amazing even though her group isnt completed yet she still defeated the person from the house of greatduke it means that kaichous strategy and game rule had good matching they are like the complete opposite type of team than us so i will leave rias to you isekun also congratulations on your promotion recommendation i will also congratulate you as well thank you very much leave both rias and the test to
meyes i have high expectations for you do your best also for the exam as well sonakaichou shows me her smile for me to see that cool kaichou making a cute smile like this it proves that we opened up to each other somehow i feel happy because kaichou also congratulates me yes i have my spirits up again so i will accomplish both the exam and test part 4 i see so you talked about things like that with sona im in the living room after having dinner i spoke about the incident at noon with rias i have one doubt though doesnt sonakaichou also have someone who shes engaged with i mean does she have a fianc i asked something like that to rias sonakaichou is also from a noble house so it would be obvious if she does have a fianc she did did she also broke it off like i did it happened a bit before she apparently challenged him to a game of chess and if she won the engagement would be broken off but if she were to lose she had to quit school and get married immediately she decided not to marry someone
who cant use his brain like her so something like that happened thats why she said she might get a boyfriend so shes single right now so in the end she won and the engagement was broken off right rias nods at my words she won the game with an overwhelming difference and broke the opponents pride into pieces its that sona who won against seegvaira agares in tactics normal people cant win against her if i have a game of chess with her now it would seem like i will lose more than win that much huh in a power battle we will not lose to the sitri group but if its a rating game that is mainly about strategy then they still donthave full members yet wont something amazing happen if they do have full members at least they still have few pawn pieces and one of their knight and rook pieces left when i was thinking about that rias spoke about it oh yes sona did say that she found someone new for the knight and rook pieces shes negotiating with them oh so the sitrigroup will finally increase their members its the sonakaichou who is a
tactician that we are talking about they must be those with certain traits no no maybe they might be powertypes if they are bishoujo then i would like to get close to them like that i was imagining the new sitrigroup now isesama ravel appeared while carrying books with both her hands lots of books are put down on the table making a loud noise ravel says it in front of the mountain of books i also gathered many books and a reference book for the promotion test today also i gathered books for the exam for the kuou academy as well this girl sure is fast and good at preparing she always brings reference books from somewhere araara looks like its time to study for the test akenosan came oh its time for studying is it i also have to study for it today i will also study as well im studying as well the trio of xenovia irina and asia came as well like this everyone gathers around this time and begins to study akenosan and i study for both the exam and the promotion test other members study for the exam then lets also study today as
well rias sat beside me and opened the stationary book she then looks around she seems to be looking for someone so koneko doesnt feel good today as wellcertainly konekochan is absent now she seems to be in bad condition lately so like that group study began without konekochan ah there are too many things to do group study finished and also the devils job is finished as well so i was lying on the bed in my room im physically exhausted but the mental stress is even worse during the time i was doing the devils job i was pedaling my bicycle while reading a book that i carried with one of my hands im glad that im a devil who can see at night even after this i have to study late into the night since both tests are coming up i have to study till the limit well im a devil and im confident in my stamina so i can somehow cope with it but there are two tests so there are so many things i have to remember and im scared that my brain will pop right now rias and the girls are making food before
studying so it will give us energy rias stays up untill late at night because she helps me with my studying she truly is an amazing woman though she seems to be leaving her class at school in order to sleep in the infirmary even so shes still an amazing woman i did confess to her but maybe i should ask her how long it will be effective for thats because i admire sweet life when i study like this i feel like ditching everything to do erotic things with rias ah is kissing her okay then how about something beyond that even ecchi things no no i have to study for the tests now i should put aside my evil desires and study with the heart of a saint but maybe she will allow me to do ecchi things as a reward for passing the test ah what happened to the filmparty at matsudas house and watching the dvd motohoma got is it invalid now uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i want to watch it i really want to watch it how come im the only one who cant watch it this isnt fair once i think about erotic things it just gets
bigger inside of me im really keeping it in myself arent i sobthis isnt fair maybe i should get rid of the youth inside me it happened when i was trying to reach for the porno magazine hidden deep under the bed i heard the sound of the door opening who is it is it rias or is it asia when i turned around it was konekochan wearing a white cloth she has her cat ears and tail out is she in nekomata mode why is she in that mode this late at night she also took a break from the devils work because she wasnt feeling well iheard shes not sick and she isnt having trouble using sennjutsu either konekochan had a red face she seems a bit hotkonekochan got close to me with an expression of ecstacy and she pulled her white cloth up inside there she isnt wearing anything i couldnt close my mouth which is opened wide because of konekochan who isnt wearing any panties ththththats because she isnt wearing panties after taking off the white cloth she got up on my bed and then hugs on to me her fast breath sweaty small body and
her soft body touches me konekochan then whispers into my ear senpai i cant control it after saying that she takes my hand and puts it on her breast its small but certainly the soft sensation can be felt then konekochan made a sweet voice nyaaaaa whats happening whats going on what is this what happened to konekochan i get confused at the sudden situation i couldnt hide my confused state because something that seems like an unbelievable action by konekochan is happening i never expected konekochan to do erotic things like rias and akenosan i could feel her dry cat tongue on my neck i got my neck licked by konekochan what is it with her tongue movement its too erotic konekochan spoke with a small voice with emotional eyes i want senpaisba ba i asked konekochan and she says it clearly baby babababababababywhat does she mean she suddenly says that she wants a baby she suddenly says something that xenovia usually does that konekochan says it with an erotic expression konekochan reveals most of her body by taking off the cloth shes basically naked a small breast appears in front of me something amazing is going on i
was imagining about doing ecchi things and then konekochan appears right in front of me saying i want senpais baby its a stimulating and ecchi situation buttheres something wrong with konekochan an expression that seems a bit hot i can see a bit of a shadow in her eyes it happened when i thought that this isnt normal the door opens and rias comes in uwaaaaaaaaaah she saw me and konekochan in a situation like this as soon as rias assessed the situation she came rushing towards me and konekochan while making loud footsteps uwa is she mad am i going to be killed thats what i thought but rias puts her hand on konekochans neck and then looks into konekochans eyes she then lastly touches her chest and stomach rias starts to think for a moment and then takes out her mobile rias then says it to me you remember the tennisclub captain abesan right eh yyes the beasttamer senpai right the owner of the dreambreaker yukionna goristee that tennisclub senpai who is always proud of herself i will call her abesan would be more knowledgeable than us about nekomata rias seems serious it seems like she isnt slightly
going to talk to us about the erotic situation that occured just now it means shes more concerned about konekochan uummmmmm whats happening to konekochan rias answers my question lets have an expert look at her first rias sounds like she knows about something she then calls abesenpai what happened to konekochanlife 2 infinite and the midclass devil promotion test part 1 so this is the mating season of nekomata huh thats the first thing sensei said when he came here after receiving a call from the other members after that we called abesenpai and had her look at konekochan and she told us her diagnosis that konekochan is acting with her instinct to make offspring konekochan is in her room now and sleeping calmly abesan specially gave her a medicine that relieved her instincts it seemed like it worked to be expected from a beast tamer she has lots of knowledge about youkai and creatures the gremory members who live in the hyoudou residence and sensei are gathered at the vip room mating season huh i mumbled is it the same as a cats well nekomatas are cat youkai after all is that the reason why she came to
me like that sensei continued nekomata females go into mating season after a while when their body becomes developed enough to bear babies in other words the instinct of being a nekomata makes them want to make babies those parts are similar to cats and in a nekomatas case they choose males of a different species that they take a liking to in other words thats you ise mme i pointed at myself and sensei nods koneko is a rare nekomata nekoshou i think its a good idea to make offspring and if that is the child of the sekiryuutei you cant ask for anything more but this time it is a bit sensei says it after making a sigh koneko is still too small yeah you are right her oppai are too small i thought of that after looking at rias and akenosans breasts rias made a sigh after realising it oh come on he means her bodyyeah you are right im sorry that im always thinking only about breasts its just such a treat for the eyes do you mean that she has a small body sensei explained to me yeah it will be dangerous for the nekoshou
to bear a child if their body and mind arent matured even in the human world giving birth puts lots of strain on the mothers body right if she bears ises child as she is there is a high chance that both she and the baby wont be able to endure it while giving birth resulting in both of them dying taking those facts into account its better to do it after her body matures a bit more konekochan said before that her body is small but she could make babies was she just saying reckless things then she certainly can give birth but it will be dangerous for both her and the baby her body isnt ready yet then wouldnt mating season not come by instinct then abesenpai also said i think it is a bit early for konekosan to go into mating season when she checked konekochan then wouldnt it be weird for the instinct of the nekoshou to determine that if it still cant give birth but why is konekochan i can understand her as one of the girls who lives in this house the one who said that was akenosan everyone looked at akenosan im sure
that konekochans emotions increased by looking at the relationship between rias and isekun so she must have thought things like i cant lose and i will be the next one very strongly rias and my relationship rias and i looked at each other did she think that she also had to do something after seeing the confession and our relationship sso she chose me that is something i could feel honoured about but in her current state it will put a lot of burden on her i cant possibly make konekochan go through such a dangerous situation did she go into mating season when her body isnt even ready because of the influences of ise and me rias says it sadly it seems like she is a bit shocked she must be thinking that her feelings towards me have stimulated her important servant maybe it might have been different if i paid more attention to her but i onlyhad eyes for rias since the confession sensei realised the weird atmosphere so he said it while scratching his head anyway suppressing her instincts forcefully isnt good if we continue to suppress it with medication then there is a chance that her
instincts wont work after she matures hes certainly right we are relying on the medications right now but we cant let konekochans body become ill by relying on it too much sensei points to me and then declared the best thing right now is for ise to endure it until konekos condition gets stabilized mme yeah it might be a good situation for you who is always in mating season but endure konekos seduction if you care about her wellbeing you should be able to endure it if you think that she will die if you have sex with her yyou might be right but there isnt any guy who wont get excited if a girl seduces you in other words you are telling me to endure this which will be like torture for me looks like amazing things are going to happen there will be both sweet and harsh everyday life events thinking about it gives me mixed feelings of excitement and hardship i put on a hard expression and rias holds my hand please ise dont give into konekos seduction you cant make babies with her okay besides even i havent yyou are right i will endure it
and will not give in to her seduction till konekochans condition becomes stable if the woman i love is begging me then i can only do what she says with high spirits if you endure it safely then i will give you a reward ne are you serious i was shocked at the sudden terms are you seriousyes im serious its ise that we are talking about so it must be something ecchi ufufu rias smiled at me oh my i can receive a reward from rias if i endure konekochans seduction no this is important but taking care of my important kouhais body is important as well i need to seal in these lecherous feelings of mine but for a lecher like me this is something very hard but if this person rias is wishing it then i i understand i will endure it for the reward no more than that i will endure it for you and konekochan yes to be expected from my lovely ise yes of course rias and i stare at each other for a while aaah the woman i love the feelings between us must be mutual the confession of that day i will
never forget it for the rest of my life this person and i hey hey stop making a scene here bakauple ha with senseis words rias and i realised that we were looking at each other for too long we let go of each others hands i also realised my face was getting red well hahahahaha i couldnt help it trying to show off aye do those things when you guys are alone isnt that right you guys sensei asked asia and the others no it seems like we can watch calmly over both of them with relief while i do get envious of them just looking at them with a sense of relief somehow heals me you are right it took quite a long time for it to progress to this stage it seems like there are flowers growing behind them in the background when they look into each others eyesthe churchtrio of asia xenovia and irina say something embarrassing like that while nodding their heads stop just thinking about what happened just now makes me so embarrassed that i want to flee from this scene ufufufu my desire to have an affair became even greater because the affairpoint
just got even higher akenosan put on a smile as if she means something what is this affairpoint thing you just mentioned that sounds both charming and scary if i recorded that scene just now and sent it to raiseroniisama he would die of agony ufufu ravel you cant bully your brother geez ise sure is blessed with amazing women oh and there is also something i need to report akeno sensei changes the topic and spoke to akenosan barakiel approved it i also think thats a good idea now the only thing left is your will so father has i understand i cant cause trouble for the group anymore than this even gasperkun is working hard i also have to be as well sometime soon akenosans face is filled with determination rias looks like she knows what this is about did akenosan ask her father something sensei nods at akenosans words okay and putting that aside can i talk to all of you sensei speaks to us with a different tone and looks at us tomorrow im planning to call a visitor to this house rias i want to get your approval for this ara its my first time
hearing about this its pretty sudden its also my first time hearing about this but it looks like rias holds the authority over this house it seems well if it has gotten renovated this much to fit her tastes then that might be an obvious thingyeah there is something about this thing sensei wore a more serious expression than usual you guys will definitely feel dislike towards this visitor no it wont be weird if you guys hold killingintent towards this visitor tthat much but killing intent what kind of guy is this visitor everyone was shocked at senseis words and looked at each other of course its someone who we hold dissatisfaction and even killingintent towards what crosses my mind isthe valiteam ise you know the group that came into your mind thats half correct sensei vali and the others are coming here again in the battle against loki those guys used this place as the base that time we were cooperating temporarily so we didnt fight each other but we were originally enemies we have a relationship where it wouldnt be weird if we fight to kill each other the next time we meet but still we met
with those guys numerous times we wont hold killing intent towards them the moment we see them vali is a terrorist we cooperated once but if they have business here again then its obvious that we will be prepared to fight but i have to say that i dont think we will hold killing intent towards them immediately i hear that they helped ise and the others at kyoto from my personal view they are enemies but dont hold as much of a threat as the herofaction just meeting them will be but we will be on alert rias says that as if she had the same thought as me sensei scratched his cheek and made a sigh after hearing rias regarding the valiteam i know that you have an unclear relation with them its just that theres something i cant say right now please wait till tomorrow morning you will know then but my wish is that you guys dont attack the visitor thats all its enough if you guys listen to the visitors story if it goes well this meeting can change the balance greatly tomorrow morning i will come back here again thats why please sensei bowed
his head down someone like that is coming all of us are in doubt so what kind of person is coming and by the sounds of it this person is coming with thevaliteam while holding doubts and uneasiness the next morning we ended up meeting it part 2 the next morning when i went out the door while having my heart beat going fast since the doorbell rang the person standing in front of the door is a skinny girl wearing a black gothiclolita costume i was familiar with her no theres no way that i could forget it theres no way in hell i would that girl just let one sentence out of her mouth it has been awhile ddraig i took a step back and pointed my finger at it ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooophis my scream was so loud that it echoed throughout the house hhhow can this be being shocked cant express my state right now its not something that i was predicting its not a joke its a shocking revelation that could turn heaven and hell around the group members who were gathered at the entrance all went into battle mode i also made my gauntlet appear and was
in a state where i was deciding whether i should start the countdown for the balancebreak of course we would she is the boss of the khaos brigade who has been picking fights with all of the factions she is like the final boss its unfair that she appears here no its not proper that she appears here she is the strongest being in this world she is like the final boss of all the factions and isnt she the infinite of the invincible so why is she visiting my house the hyoudou residence is my house that famous is it an important place that even a final boss would visit mystery and doubts were formed from the sudden fact that ophis appeared but the feelings of how to respond to this situation get stronger in that situation sensei comes in between us hey hey hey i told you yesterday not to hold killing intent no matter who comes so no attacking she also wont attack you even if she did we cant defeat her even if we all fight together rias gets enraged at senseis words this is absurd azazel that dragon is the boss of the terrorist group
that has been attacking each of the factions she is a bitter enemy who hasalso caused significant damage to the world of devils so why did you bring such an enemy to this place into this town which is an important location for the alliance and especially this house doesnt allowing ophis into this town mean that you deceived those who secure this town so why did you do something like this rias is right this town is the place where the underworld and heaven make cooperative actions and also the place used to negotiate with other factions the most important place its also the place where few staff members from the angels fallenangels and devils besides us reside to maintain it i think having her in such a place means either sensei persuaded the staff members or deceived them seeing irina having such a shocked face means that she didnt receive any information from heavens side of course we didnt get any information about it from the devils side either if such a person like her was to come sirzechssama would have told us before hand but we werent informed then it could be thought that sensei made ophis
visit the hyoudous residence without informing sirzechssama or michaelsan rias realised that immediately and yelled towards sensei and ophis because this is this is breaking the rules of the alliance azazel its something where the fallenangel sides cant complain even if they were to be blamed by maousama and the leader of the angels michael why would you who has been talking about an alliance do such the snapped rias stops there she then inhales the air it is you who has been talking about alliances so you have determined that this visit from ophis has that much value correct rias said that conclusion shes right there isnt any reason for us to doubt sensei now this person seemed fishy and seemed like an enemy when we first met him but now he is the governor of fallenangels that we can trust from deep within our hearts we broke through disasters numerous times because of this person the reason we became this strong is also because of senseis help and knowledge there is no way that sensei would betray us who he is always so concerned about rias probably started to remember that while she was enraged yeah im sorry
rias i have deceived and am still deceiving many people in order for her to come and visit here but maybe her wish would be something that might change the existence of khaos brigade itself i determined that it was necessary to stop unnecessary blood from beingshed i will apologise to you guys again and will ask you guys again im sorry and i ask you can you at least listen to her story sensei bows his head down once again this man who has such a high pride is doing this it must have magnificent meaning behind this i will trust sensei the reason im here like this is thanks to sensei i just said that and made my gauntlet disappear the other group members also looked at each other and put their weapons away im always in the care of sensei i want to slash my sword at ophis this instant buti will endure it xenovia folded her arms and closed her eyes to allow ophis in while not informing michaelsama personally i dont know what i should do but there is no other choice but to believe in riassan and azazelsensei irina also affirmed it while having
complicated feelings from where she stands she should be the one with the most difficulty since she is the representative of the heavens side staff but she still affirmed it its proof that she believes in sensei and us im happy to see that i just have to believe in isesan and riasoneesama like i did from the start i have the same thought as her as well asia and ravel are also fine with it i also think that kiba and gasper who arent here konekochan who is sleeping in the bed and also rossweissesan who returned to northen europe temporarily would have the same thoughts as them rias made a sigh and then asked sensei so then shall i just let her in and give her green tea is it only ophis what about the vali team asking that a light was formed in front of the entrance and a small magiccircle appeared the one who appeared from there is the magician from the vali team le fay who is wearing a cape and pointy hat and a large dog with ashgrey fur putting le fay aside this ash coloured dog i remember it i mean i wont
forget this chilling feeling just by looking at it it became much smaller than before but there is no mistakingit its fenrir a godkilling wolf that is said to kill and eat god with its fangs if i remember it went under the vali teamhow are you doing everyone it is i le fay pendragon i have been under your care at kyoto this over here is fenrirchan a magician girl who gave us a polite and gentle introduction it seems like fenrir is also attached to her and it isnt giving off any hostility towards us even so it is still a legendary creature so its still scary enough then a glamorous woman appeared from another magiccircle she hugged onto me soon as she appeared munyuun aaah i can feel the sensation of enormous breasts long time no see sekiryuuteichin do you still like oppai like always it is konekochans sister kuroka shit the sensation of her oppai is great its kuroka wwhat kind of pairing is this it doesnt seem like anyone else will be appearing so is this everyone from the vali team vali and bikou havent come so only the girl members came that big golem
isnt here right because its too big and it wouldnt be able to enter the house there is something that is looking straight at me who is being hugged by kuroka its ophis ophis said one thing i want to talk sensei also persuades me drink tea with her i deceived and lied to other factions in order to make this setting if this was found out and it goes into a bad direction my head will get cut off for real i understand that i will do it i will do anything even drinking tea with her to my grandpa at heaven it seems like i really do get involved in many things finally the time for me to drink tea with the ultimate being has come a strange mixture of members that are gathered in the vip room we the gremoryteamkiba and gasper came but konekochan is still resting in her room irina ravel sensei and valiteams le fay fenrir kurokaand ophis who is the center of this meeting a gathering of those for who it would normally be impossible to meet here is your tea akenosan gave green tea to the valiteam members and ophis while being
on alert le fay drinks green tea while kuroka is eating snacks that go well with tea fenrir is sleeping near le fay they sure dont have any feeling of being nervous kiba also came and is on standby behind me his expression is the same as usual but he has his senses sharp on alert so he can jump in anytime he wants gyasuke went to konekochans place it seems like hes worried about konekochan who is his friend if he is besides her konekochan should calm down to a certain degree i then whispered into senseis ear who is sitting next to me so what should i do an obvious question to ask sensei asked us to listen to her story but i dont know in what manner to progress the conversation the group members are also here with awkward faces and are feeling nervous thats because we wont know if an unimaginable battle will occur because of something if that happens i think this town will blow up starting from this house it is certain that we would be annihilated then sensei replies to me who is nervous she is interested in you so answer her if
she asks a question it will be a good opportunity to understand her eeven if you say that sshes the boss of the terrorists and is the ultimatedragon right on top of that shes stronger than sensei and sirzechssama i wont be able to get rid of this nervousness even if sensei is beside me wont you also die with us if it turns into a battle she wont do something like going on a rampage if you compare her to vali and cao cao she basically has no will towards battle she wont do something like attacking others besides great red so it means you will be having a conversation with her representing each of the factions in the world listen okay just have a good time and have tea with her got it even if you say that i could only be confused while scratching my cheek i mean i have two tests waiting for me so what are we doinghere there are too many things happening is this also the power of sekiryuutei that attracts power it must be the fact is that she came here because she took an interest in me so did my power
finally attract the ultimate being it seems like it finally became serious i made a sigh while thinking like that and ophis just stared right at me i moved my lips and put on a smile and asked ttthen what business do you have with me smile i need to smile i cant be afraid its dangerous that a single one of my words can cause trouble for all the factions of the world i dont want to have my name engraved in history for something weird oppaidragon has become the cause for the destruction of the human world i will cry if something like that gets recorded in the students textbook in the underworld ophis put her mouth onto the tea she then put it on the table and spoke ddraig do you want to quit being a heavenlydragon hhmmm it feels like she asked something that i dont get from the start i let words out of my mouth while putting on a smiley face ummm no i dont understand what you are trying to say the human who is the host hes been having a different sense of growth up until now i think this is very
strange very different from previous heavenlydragons vali is also the same strange very strange me and valis growth thats strange ophis continues the fight against cao cao the fight against bael ddraig had different evolutions armour turned crimsoncoloured its the first time first time that i know of so the fact my armour turned crimson is already known i thought that it would be scary the next time i met cao cao ophis still continuesthats why i want to ask ddraig what will you become she asked while twitching her neck ara shes cute i thought something like that but how should i answer her should i just say that i trained without thinking only seeking for breasts and powered up but that wont be the answer that ophis is looking for then my gauntlet appeared by itself is it ddraig ddraig then said it so everyone could hear it i dont know ophis i dont know what this guy wants to become i dont know but its certain that hes having an interesting growth oh nice one it will be easier to have ddraig talk so i hope that the discussion will become good between the legendary dragons i
will support you if it turns into a fight so i leave it to you partner ophis looked at my gauntlet and talked twoheavenly dragons mixed i as the infinite and great red as the dream into the chant ddraig why did you think of becoming the king of domination it must be the result of seeking strength because of that i was eliminated i couldnt become strong besides increasing the power of domination i never thought that my red colour could turn to crimson i dont understand domination those from khaos brigade seek domination i dont understand greatred isnt domination i also am not domination there is no way for a being that has been strong from the beginning would be able to understand the reasons for domination you who was born from the nothingness of infinite and greatred who was born from illusions from dream must have been from a different dimension ophis you appeared in this world getting out from the dimensional gap what have you attained from this world and why did you think of returning to your homeland i also want to question you ddraig why do you try to become a different being will
you discard domination what is ahead after that she answers him by questioning him i mean i dont even understand these guys conversation at all i dont understand even a single thing there are things that are hard to understand from a conversation betweendragons it also felt like albion midgardsormr vritra and yulong spoke in their own pace of time the usual ddraig and oldman tannin had some human behavior in them you could say so it was easy to understand them but seeing ddraig and ophis speak like this makes me think that ddraig holds a different perspective towards the world from mine maybe it is because they know a different view of the world from me very interesting indeed a conversation between a heavenlydragon and a dragongod is something you dont see often sensei was listening to their conversation with his eyes sparkling he does seem like he likes these kinds of things well i will leave this to my partner then if it is me then i wont be able to keep up with ophiss conversation i thought that my partner was someone i can depend on that much but it changes after seeing his reaction with
ophiss next question ddraig will you become the chichiryutei can you surpass a heavenlydragon by groping tits ddraig will you become a dragon that represents tits ddraig who heard thatreacts in a way in which he needs to inhale some air uggeven ophis ends up saying that uuu haahaa my consciousness got cut counselor someone call the counselor crap it seems like he is about to break because he received too much damage mentally i got the medicine out and sprinkled it onto the jewel calm down ddraig heres the medicine ddraig who had his jewel sprinkled with medicine had his feelings relaxed and starts to calm down ahyeah ssorry this mmedicine sure works you are too delicate it looks like ddraigs soul is exhausted for real sorry im really sorry i want to look ddraig i want to look at this possessor even more ophis stares at me againmme oh man even if shes emotionless it seems like her eyes have the colour of interest in it sensei breathes out and then put his hand on my shoulder so like that can you leave her in this house for a few days just as you see ophis wants to
look at you i dont know what reason there is behind this but it will be fine if its just looking right even if you say it like that having her who is the boss of the terrorists and the final boss look at me with interested eyes is a bit i looked at rias for help but i dont mind if ise is okay with it of course we will be on alert and we will have to stop her with full force if anything happens if you accept that then i willtake this request azazel rias is okay with it i think she took an interest in ophiss true motive if we can find the string that will lead to the collapse of khaos brigade then we cant ask for anything more if we can stop the terrorist organisation by talking to their boss then that would be the best having the fight stop without spilling blood seems peaceful and good but i dont think that cao cao would stop that easily it seems like the revolt in each area where he tells the sacred gear possessors how to attain balancebreak is still going on but is being
taken care off with few exceptions and in a situation like that ophiss thoughts will change the direction of the world and deciding that would dependon my actions why is such an important task placed into my hands i just want to live peacefully with everyone why does everyone bring such troubles and causes to me i just want to live in peeeeeeeeace even if i shout like that within my heart its certain that i have to accept this request im ok with it as well its just that the tests are coming up soon so if shes not a nuisance then its okay i gave up after giving the minimum rule sensei puts his hand on my head im sorry for dragging you in every time ise putting stress on you even though its right before your important test but this is a chance if it goes smoothly then the threat that each faction is facing might lessenyes yes i will do my best i cant decline it if sensei bows his head down you are my benefactor after all im not in the position to say this but ophis and kuroka these guys have important tests coming
up so just dont disturb them understood i will just relax nyan ophis and kuroka agreed to senseis order did they really agree to it i was looking at the two of them with doubtful eyes and then le fay came to me pushing out something it was an autograph paper she says it while twitching her body uumm the battle against bael the other day i was deeply moved please give me your signature if it isnt too much oh yeah this girl is my fan hahaha all of valis comrades are crazy strong but they do lack in being nervous and they are all weirdos yeah yeah i signed her autograph paper while making a bitter smile like this we took in an absurd visitor and spent our days together untill the test day part 3 its the weekend and we still continue to study for the test there is one girl in gothiclolita clothing sitting at the corner looking at us obviously its ophis a few days have passed since that day and i have my books out studying with the other members of the group in the spacious living room for the exam and promotion test
and in the corner of the living room ophis is sitting staring directly at us and thats while she is eating tea cakes that mum gave this abnormal scene is very bad for me mentally we have tests right in front of us you know everyone else is studying trying not to think about it but sometimes they look at ophis of course they would since the boss of the terrorists is on standby in the corner of the room to tell you the truth its not a time in which i can study right nowbut i dont feel any hostility or fighting spirit from her she really is just sitting there kuroka le fay and fenrir are playing at the indoor swimming pool located at the basement of the hyoudou residence i told those two girls and the dog to remain inside the house they agreed to it but putting le fay aside i didnt think kuroka will listen to me that easily it seems like she will go outside if she finds the chance it seems like a riot will occur if she is found by staff who is affiliated with the three bigpowers alliance that would be
scary no no i need to concentrate on my studies the tests are coming up i received a recommendation so i cant do something like betray sirzechssamas trust hmmmmm i know the name of the 72 pillars perfectly i also remember the rules we need to obey while living in the human world i also remember the houses that survived and the way of how to maintain them in my head also the different ways of treating your familiar depending on whether it is a creature or youkai i also kind of understand the political differences between the oldmaou faction and currentmaou faction and the information regarding the legendary creatures the dragons has been input into my head already i also memorized about certain gods from each faction as well though im not so sure about application problems underworld economics and folkloristics from different regions ngggggh kiba and akenosan answer questions written by rias with ease im still struggling because i still make mistakes maybe she feels well today since konekochan is studying for the exam with us are you alright konekochan im alright gyakun konekochan smiles at gasper who is worried about his friend her face is red as
if she doesnt realize it so it must mean that her condition is still going on konekochan didnt appear in front of me after that incident we both made sure not to see each other as much as possible it seemed like she is really fighting against her instinct her body desires that but her heart doesnt shes in a complicated condition to tell you the truth it is really sad that i cant talk to konekochan there were times i felt like doing something because she also sometimes shows sad expressions but what is important right now is that i dont have contact with konekochan konekochan became unwell right before the exam but both konekochan and gyasuke have excellent school reports so they wont have problems for the exam even if they dont study that much its more like im in a tightsituation in that situation ravel taught me things i didnt know using resources it seems like isesama will be able to answer questions regarding those people who appear in legends because you have met some of them though it seems like the underworld economics and folkloristics will become an obstacle for those people who have been reincarnated
into a devil from a human there are lots of differences between the values humans and devils have so it will be natural for there to be things that are hard to understand regarding economics and folkloristics since the fundamental culture is different after all so the test will ask questions about that so even if you dont understand the feelings and thoughts of devils i think it would be better to answer them by thinking the devils would do it like this instead i see i mean their personality changes depending from which house they are from so the way they rule their territory is also different gremory has strong love so there arent any unfair rules towards the people living there but it doesnt mean its the same in the other territories right since the world of devils circulate as the noble society the different values due to different culture looks like most marks for the test will be about that after all former humans who turned into devils are going to join the world of devils so not knowing their culture wont allow them to get a promotion its said that the underworld is gradually changing but
the fundamental base is different from that of the human world seems like understanding those things will be the problem for me hmmmm becoming a highclass devil seems very hard maybe the promotion test for becoming a highclass devils might be so hard that i would get shocked then asia stood up suddenly and went towards ophis uumm maybe eating just tea cakes might not be good so here is some green tea she took the cup she filled with green tea to ophis wwhat a brave girl ophis took the cup silently and then drank the green tea after seeing that asia smiled and came back to us i then whispered to asias ear yyou sure are brave asia i thought that she might not be someone so scary even last night irinasan invited her to play cards with herhaa i got shocked hearing that and looked at irina she made a peace sign with her fingers to me with a smiley face filled with confidence yes i asked her to play with me i got to play cards with the ultimate dragon sshe sure has guts if i remember correctly she also talked to arthur from the valiteam
during the fight against loki but it makes me envious of her because she can casually talk to people even in a situation like this ah did michaelsan make her into his ace knowing her personality with a personality like this she can communicate with any kind of person he might have thought that keeping her in a place like this that makes her meet people from different factions will allow her to play the role of the representative of angels more significantly a change shes quite different from the uroboros that is told in the legend kiba said that akenosan nods and agrees she definitely has a different impression from the dragon that represents chaos infinite and nothingness the dragongod that is said to be infinite huh looking at her like this she doesnt seem like a being that is called god of dragons greatred looks more like a god of dragons instead just like kiba said maybe she changed because she stayed in this world too long i think im beginning to understand why sensei gained an interest in her this dragon called ophis must be a being filled with many doubts and that dragongod has taken an
interest in me i took a glimpse at ophis and like i thought she was staring right at me what on earth is she trying to gain from me just like that the group study continued while the dragon of infinite remained the night before the midclass promotion test day i stopped studying for the test at an appropriate time and went to sleep earlier for the test but i noticed the atmosphere from the upper floor was different when i went to the toilet i became suspicious of it and i went up the staircase the door of a certain room was opened its konekochans room the lights coming from her room can be seen from the corridor i can hear a conversation from inside the room i killed my presence and got closer to the door i thought it might be it if my guess is right then she must have i heard her voice just like i thought fufun i knew that shirone had gone into mating season at a glance nyan is it that you cant control yourself from desiring that mans genetics nyan this has nothing to do with neesama now now if you want
i can teach you the method of making sekiryuutei fall for you nyan just like i thought it is kuroka she entered konekochans room and is trying to put unnecessary things in her man i told her that much not to cause any problems and right now konekochan is in a complicated season we will be troubled if she stimulates her in a negative way kuroka is erotic to begin with maybe i should tell her off but how should i enter the room its konekochans room so i cant enter normally it happened while i was thinking of how to enter her room nfufu there is a lecherous dragon looking inside the room nyan it seems like kuroka knew about me then it cant be helped i will just go in the door is opened a bit i knocked on the door just in case and entered konekochans room konekochan and kuroka sat opposed to each other in front of the bed wearing pajamas konekochan has her cat ears and tail out her tail is out swinging and i can tell that she is in an excited condition her eyes are also sharp but her face is red and
i can tell she is about to collapse any second kuroka what did you tell konekochan you are wrong nya i knew shirone was in mating season as soon as i saw her so i came to see how she was doing its a natural thing for the elder sister to do this right kuroka winks adorably but konekochans expression just gets more serious seeing that it seems like she came to look because she was interested in it rather than being worried about it as her elder sister this season is very delicate nyan for examplekuroka suddenly pulled konekochans arm and then pushed her towards me konekochan comes to my chest i caught her but konekochan who was pushed towards my chest made an emotional expression with her eyes teary nyaa senpai the small lips made a sweet and low voice sound her tail that was spinning around before is now wrapped around my right arm no matter how much you endure it you will feel like making babies when you feel the skin of the man you love sekiryuutei shirone is in a condition where she can only think of making babies with you eeven if you say
that i cant lay my hands on her if i do anything reckless then it will put a huge burden on konekochans body even if i say that konekochan is grinding her body against me she tries to take my clothes off with an erotic expression as if the strong will that had been stopping her from doing it was removed she also started to take her pajamas off as well its getting into a serious situation because i can see her small oppai appearing and disappearing from the gaps of the pajamas no no no no no no no you cant konekochan if you do something like that with me and get pregnant it will become dangerous for both konekochan and the baby with her current bodysenpai will you not take it if it is my body am i not able to have sex imalready prepared to take on senpai even if there are lots of small parts my body is still that of a woman thats why i want senpais body please dont say thaaaaaaaaaaaat if you say it with an emotional face and sound like that i will lose my consciousness i made a promise with rias
that i will not make love to konekochan rias said she will give me a reward if i were to fulfil that this is both important for me and konekochan endure endure me but konekochans small body is also soft i tried to retreat but something got wrapped around my leg and i fell on my butt because of that my sights were about the same height as konekochan and her face is right in front of me konekochan then embraces me its turning into an outrageous situation i dont want to lose to the torimusume4 i dont want senpai to be taken away even if i cant become senpais manager i think i can satisfy senpais desire like this konekochan acted as if it didnt bother her but she had ravel in her mind she had her in her mind because they are in the same grade but i dont think she wants to be of use to me using her body thats because konekochan also has her good parts kuroka is looking at this situation with amusement damn you nekomata woman shes enjoying this situation i thought she will just stay and look at us but she came
towards us instead surusurusuru she took off the obi from her kimonoand started taking off her kimono her rich breast appears and even the pink part is visible huge her oppai doesnt even lose to rias or akenosan in terms of size fufufu taking sekiryuuteis purity in front of shirone will also be tasty as well i couldnt help drinking my spit because the way she licks her lips looks very erotic kuroka pulls konekochan off of my body and instead hugs on to meeeeee her naked breasts touch me what a rich sensation its similar to akenosans oppai for being soft and magnetic but it doesnt lose to riass oppai in terms of elasticity i was thanking the oppai of nekomata because it is wellbalanced i cant keep my self calm because her legs also have nice meat on them apparently there were many humans whomated with nekomata by getting seduced by them but i can understand why its too erotic kuroka who is horseriding me looks down at me and then said you still dont have any experience right she saw through me is it something that is easy to tell i thought you were having sex every
night with switchprincesschan looks like you arent nya it cant be helped if you are keeping it in because of it alright then this oneesan will become your first woman nyan its okay i will teach you from the beginning because she said something so erotic that it boils my brain my head feels like it will blow up she didnt even care about the state im in and started to use her tongue to lick me from my belly till my neck its dry but soft and warm so the sensation of it is making me lose my mind she started to lick away her saliva with her tongue this is the taste of sekiryuutei i see i memorised it nyan i never expected to taste it before valis nyan i see so you memorised my taste i dont know what it means but i know certainly that this is very erotic erotic you are too erotic nekomataoneesan i started to think vali is gay for declining to give his genetics to an erotic woman like her how obsessed is he with fighting kuroka says it while telling konekochan to come to her shirone oneechan will teach you how
the intercourse of nekomata is done here look at this man and memorize his taste konekochan is starting to lose her reason but she is following what kuroka said with a vague expression she starts to lick my neck with her small tongue hold on intercourse i felt something that is hard to describe this is this really is this is very indecent i cant resist konekochan who seems like the chain that was binding her consciousness broke starts to lick around my body please forgive me it feels so good that my consciousness will also go nuts konekochan doesnt seem like she will stop but kuroka pokes konekochans neck withher finger then konekochans body shakes she then falls onto my body as if she lost all the strength in her body did kuroka use some kind of technique to stop konekochan though she seems like she still has her consciousness left kuroka then says it after laying konekochan to the side anyway shirone you stop here for now it seems like you went into mating season because of being influenced by other women but both you and the baby will die with your current body nyan if you really
want this mans child then you should learn how to control your mating season nya hey sekiryuutei im a better bargain than her you know i see so konekochan will be able to control her mating season if she grows bigger like kuroka so it means that it would be better for her not to do child making until then hearing kurokas declaration some strength came back into konekochans eyes no konekochan moves while her body trembles she then hugs onto me as if she is protecting me from kuroka senpai is my senpai i will never give him to you neesama it was a desperate cry of konekochan konekochan im very happy but i also though that kuroka is erotic and wonderful as well no no i have to side with konekochan seeing that kuroka stood there astonished she then made a chuckle excuse me the blackcat over there a sudden voice of another person when i turned my head around ravel was standing there araara if it isnt the daughter from the house of phoenix nyan ravel got closer to kuroka and then says it it seems like you are konekosans sister konekosan isnt feeling very well right
now if you are trying to do something to her then i her classmate will not forgive you also please get away from isesama oh ravel is arguing against kuroka while breathing violently even so she is still concerned about konekochan she seems to be concerned aboutme so thank you ravel getting shouted at by ravel made kuroka speechless but so you are shirones friend nyan hmmm lots of people are appearing one by one who are always concerned about her kuroka puts ravels drill hair on her palm and touches it looks like i made shirones friend angry nyan she says it while sticking her tongue out she then tries to leave the room while putting her kimono back on she then lowers her body before going past me and then whispers into my ear shirone is only unstable right now nyan so please dont let her push herself it was a gentle voice after saying just that she leaves the room while passing ravel a valuable nekoshou if you dont take care of it it will be a disaster for our tribe she leaves the room while waving her hand back could she possibly have konekosan are you
alright ravel gets worried about konekochans wellbeing ravel why are you here when i asked her she answers while having her cheeks red wwell i am her classmate after all so i just happened to see how she was doing every night its konekochans responsibility to look after me since im still new to japan i will be the one who will be troubled if she doesnt get better thats it ah so ravel was worried about her as well and she happened to be checking on her every night she seriously isnt honest with herself im sorry both of you senpai because of mekonekochan apologizes to me and ravel as if she actually feels bad about it huh is it me or did the redness disappear from her face and returned to normal i touched konekochans cheek after apologising to her beforehand by saying sorry i touched her for about 10 seconds but it doesnt seem like konekochan is excited or is about to change at all hey konekochan how do you feel when i asked her konekochan also seems like she noticed the change in her condition and starts to touch her cheek and stomach its back to
normal just like i thought her mating season stopped thats why nothing happened even after i touched her for 10 seconds its different from the time i touched her before what happened ravel also seems to be in doubt i understood the reason why its kuroka just before kuroka poked konekochans neck with her finger then konekochan fell down onto me but looking at konekochan now kuroka must have used some kind of technique to stop konekochans mating season kuroka i dont know what her true intention is maybe she did it because of the heart of being konekochans sister or maybe she did because she felt like it but its certain that konekochan is back to normal thats something i could truly feel happy about though i do feel a bit sad as well tthats because seeing an erotic konekochan like that is something you wont be able to see often i will just save it inside my brain but because of that one worry i had before my test is gone i felt truly relieved about that part 4 its the day of the test we were gathered at the transport magiccircle located in the basement of the
hyoudou residence we are dressed in kuou academys uniform thishas basically become the uniform of the gremory group we are also holding our bags in our hands inside them were the important things that were required for the test it reminds me of the high school entrance exams the ones who are going to the stadium to take the test are me kiba akenosan and my manager ravel rias sensei and the other club members are going to the underworld along with us but they are going to wait for us at the hotel located at the stadium the transport will send us right into the stadium so only those of us who are taking the test are going on it first after that rias and the others will transport to the hotel i thought that we would get transported to gremory territory first and then go to the stadium using a car or through a similar method but that doesnt seem to be the case the reason is well its because we are popular but over there the relationship rias and i have has also gotten quite a lot of attention so it seems like its better to avoid
going to places with large amounts of people yes its because i confessed to her during the rating game after that the media started to write an article about it almost immediately serious relationship between master and servant like that it continued to gather lots of attention from the civilians living in the underworld so we were told that we would be surrounded by the media as soon as we step outside rias is a princess of gremory and shes also the sister of the maou and her boyfriend is me aka oppai dragon the two people who have been the main topic of the media got into a relationship so many people are talking about us rias who is a puredevil a princess and the sister of maou you who is her servant the sekiryuutei who is also the oppaidragon it will turn into a love romance that will surpass social status what will happen if a topic like that gets out of the aristocrat society it seems it is the hot gossip topic amongst womens from normal background thats what sensei said is it something like that romance that surpasses social status huh but in the underworld it
seems like they are supporting it it seems like its getting really serious because people from the media are asking oniisama for an interviewravel also said that i see raiser is riass exfianc after all from how it got broken off the story would be something that medias would love to cover when it happened the engagement break off only became famous amongst the noble devils so the media didnt take that much of an interest in it but its much different now the medias in the underworld will gather around you who became popular because of oppaidragon having that in mind it was decided that we will go directly to the stadium the media seems to have obtained the information that we will be taking the test so they are gathering around the stadium man i seriously dont know what to say is this something i should feel happy about in my case i just want them to be quiet about us i just confessed to her you know im still thinking about how i can progress in my relationship with rias because of that i wasnt even able to have a single date with rias since my confession
i was thinking about asking her out on a date but i couldnt do anything because of things like my tests konekochans condition and ophiss visit to my house i looked around but i couldnt find gasper isnt gasper here to send us off he transported out of here long before us to go to grigoris research institute that is located in the underworld sensei answers me by himself i got astonished to find out something that i couldnt have predicted sensei nods right after that match against bael he came to me while crying i want to be strong like senpai and everyone i dont want to be just protected anymore im a boy from the gremory team so i dont want to show a miserable appearance anymore he begged sensei like that so something like that happened he was a hikikomori and also a coward even so he came knocking onto the gate of grigori so its not some weak determination right about now he is probably facing his own sacred gear under the instruction of the researchersi see he wanted to seriously become stronger so other than basic training he began learning to understand and face his
sacred gear even more he must have reached a dead end which resulted in him going to the research institute of the fallen angels yeah he is a man after all come back after attaining something new gasper gasper is also important but what are these guys going to do i looked at ophis and kuroka what are ophis kuroka and le fay going to do i ask sensei they are going to the hotel with us it will be bad if they follow you to the stadium well thats obvious but is it alright for them to go to the hotel also after your tests are finished im planning to take ophis to sirzechss place its a good opportunity ophis also said she will go as long as you are going as well thats why you guys will also go to sirzechss place after the test is over so sensei is already planning ahead i understand i dont know what i can do but taking ophis in front of sirzechssama has a big meaning to it right yeah if possible i want this to go to in the right direction even if its only a little bit negotiation that
had been said to be impossible may now be possible its a big step i dont know what ophis is thinking but because of it it may be possible to avoid a continued fight if everything goes well the enemy organisation itself may collapse and split up if that happens it will become possible to crush them one by one if they lose the power of ophiss snake defeating them will occur earlier than we had thought i even want to thank vali who had suggested this vali huh the one who left ophis in the care of sensei is him he must be thinking in his own way as well for him to place ophis in our care sensei says it with narrow eyes after hearing me he must have wanted to hide ophis from a threat that is threat is ophis being targeted by someone well she is the boss of the terrorists so that would be natural all of the factions are thinking that defeating her will make the organisation collapse so they would target her but they just cant lay their hands on her because she is the ultimate being afterall but vali tried to hide
ophis from that threat hmmm sensei seems to know what it is but i dont have a single clue well its no use thinking about that here i will just think about passing the test for now everyone looked after me during my studies so i wont be able to face them if i dont show any results and after this finishes theres still the school exam left my troubles havent finished yet it happened when me kiba akenosan and ravel were about to leave using the transport wait rias stops us she came to me and then kisses my cheek its a charm ise i believe that you will definitely pass i received the best charm there is okay then this is it i will confess this feeling i have inside me i will definitely pass wwhen i pass please go on a date with me i said it i said it properly i was able to ask her out by myself rias became dazzled for an instant when i asked her out but she showed a very happy smile after that yes lets go on a date its a promise i will be waiting yeaaaaah i made a
promise for a date a date with rias its the best the only thing left is passing the test i will pass by burning up my soul since the date is on the line geez getting all lovelydovely in front of everyone it sure is good to be young sensei makes a sigh as if he doesnt find it fun dont say it like that i was able to ask her on a date while having this embarrassing feeling then we will be going the four of us bid our farewells to rias and the others and we were enveloped in a light please wait rias i love youpart 5 when the light stopped we were at a spacious floor there is a large magiccircle still emitting a shallow light under my feet is this the test stadium where the promotion test will be held welcome you are the servants of rias gremorysama correct i have heard about it please show me something to identity yourselfs the staff members who are wearing a stiff costume approach us asking for identification if i remember correctly i have to show the seal with the gremory symbol on it and also the recommendation
paper we showed them our seals and recommendation papers this seal is made from the bone of a certain creature and it is grinded into a palm sized circular shape its a crimson colour and it has a mark engraved into it the staff confirms our recommendation papers and seals and say this way please and then guide us we walk into a corridor made from rocks it does not seem like a gorgeous interior but is made very simply and accurately this is the promotion test center for midclass devils located in the territory of glaysalabolas kiba tells me quietly while we are walking hee so this is the territory of glaysalabolas i was so concerned about the test that i didnt bother checking where the location of the test was if its the territory of glaysalabolas then its the territory of the household where that maou who said working is losing asmodeussama belongs to its also the homeland of that yankee who got beaten to a pulp by sairaorgsan it seems like they built the midclass promotion test center here because of the influence of the strategist falbium asmodeus akenosan also says that i only have that maousama
who seems like he doesnt want to do anything in my mind so its hard to imagine it seems like there is also a test center in the territory of astaroth which is the household from which ajuka beelzebubsama came from there are test centers in various places throughout the underworld but the one with the most authority is the one held in the territory of astaroth after all there are also noble schools for the noble devils located there buchou also had trouble choosing between the school in the territory ofastaroth and the one in the area of maou but she ended up going to the school in the area of maou kiba answered like that oh is that so then why are we at the glaysalabolas territory today because of the earlier incident the house of astaroth lost authority kiba said it quietly so the staff walking ahead of us couldnt hear it i see that incident involving diodora astaroth caused this then i heard that the house of astaroth went into a dangerous situation because of him it seems like they avoided the worst case scenario because of the influence of ajukasama who is the chief advisor
for the technical equation program but its certain that they are being looked at with strict eyes from the civilians living in the other territories as well as the other nobles they also lost their right to send out the candidate to be the next maou as well the place where we arrived at after being led by the staff is a place that seemed like a reception area there were a couple of windows and test participants were talking to the receptionists there are less devils here than i thought a reception area which is quite spacious looks dead because there arent many people in it then the staff explains to us at the reception area over there please take the compulsory documents along with the admission ticket for the test after you are done with that please go to the floor upstairs where the written test will be held the first part of the test will be the written section and the second part will be practical so written test first huh i studied a lot for it but i want to get a lot of points on the practical test please hand your report to the examiners
who are standing in front of the room for the written section of the test so i have to hand my report to the person in front of the test room i wrote my report on the theme grayfiasan told me im still not used to writing with devil letters so i desperately wrote it while holding the dictionary in my other hand then i will pardon myself i hope you do well the staff left after saying thati will go and bring the documents you must fill out after saying that ravel goes away quickly wow that girl really is thoughtful looks like there arent that many people taking the test yeah in the current underworld there arent that many devils who can take the promotion test the promotion test center for highclass devils might even have less devils taking it kiba answers like that yeah since there arent any wars in the underworld right now you can only get a promotion by attaining something magnificent from the pact for devils jobs or by excellent performance in the rating game though the first option is very hard to get promotion with so it became the mainstream way to get
a promotion test through the rating game even so it looks like we are special cases isekun theres one thing i want to tell you before the test kiba stood next to me and wore a serious expression what is it im glad that i met you here i was wondering what he was about to say you really became a natural at saying creepy things when i said that with a disgusted face kiba laughed hahaha but if you werent here i would probably never have gotten a promotion test are you sure you are strong enough you would have gotten a promotion sooner or later no im here because i witnessed how you live your life and your battles you showed me things that i didnt have i wouldnt have been here if i didnt know about itis it something like that i also got influenced by him a lot as well there were a majority of things where i worked harder because he was someone near whom i aimed for i made a sigh while scratching my cheek im not quite sure what goodlooking guys think is something that i cant possibly understand butlets pass the test
together since we are boys of the gremory team right dachikou5 of course if weve come this far then lets aim to become ultimatedevils ive also got a dream now to become the ultimate knight i want to become an existence that can stand side by side with you kiba seeks for a handshake i answered him with a laugh that sounds good thats simple to understand i wont know for how many thousands of years i will be with you but lets become men who will be famous throughout the underworld akenosan also puts her hand on our handshake ufufu such a passionate friendship lets pass the test together yes yes both kiba and i replied at the same time yeah lets become midclass devils together everyone i have brought the documents lets fill them out over there with ravels instruction we filled out the documents so the test is about to begin please do your best i will be waiting here we split up from ravel at the staircase leading to the second floor and us three headed up to the third floor we saw a sign written in devilletters written as midclass promotion test written test room
the room we reached had long desks aligned inside it looks like the rooms you see in universities i also saw a university room when i went to look at the kunou universityi must sit on the table with the number 012 written on at by the way kibas number is 011 and akenosans number is 010 when the three of us sat down we heard people whispering are those people from the gremory team the holydemonic sword wielder sekiryuutei and holylightning priestess the oppai dragon who defeated that sairaorg sekiryuutei so the rumours about them getting a promotion recommendation from maousama were true so thats why there were so many people with cameras outside this truly is making me feel embarrassed everyone knows about us well we became famous because of the news tokusatsu show and the match that occurred recently judging from their conversation the media has gathered outside this test center if we say it in human terms maybe they would be called the paparazzi man that is scary but this is something i have predicted thats why i have to take the test calmly without making an embarrassment of myself i made a serious face and
a strong attitude i think you dont have to put that much energy and act like you usually do thats what kiba says but we came here while having the name gremory on our backs while i was doing that other testees gathered and the seats around us started to get filled up with the other devils taking the test but a room that can hold up more than a 100 hundred people didnt even get filled they are mostly devils who were former humans but there were also devils who looked like beasthumans youkai and creatures well humans arent the only ones who can be reincarnated therefore many types and kinds of devils can take the promotion test i looked around but including us the number didnt even reach up to 40 people thats not that many people i did hear that a promotion is rare but i never expected it to be this low the seats are mostly empty i think i understand sairaorgsans dream and aim it might be good to give a chance to people who have talent but in the current underworld that would be hard sensei also said that the politicians are broken into
the maoufaction and greatkingfaction while i was thinking about this theexaminer entered the room and began collecting the reports we gave our reports to the examiner and finally we were about to start the written test putting the practical aside im not confident in the written test but still rias ravel and the others helped me i will definitely aim for a good result its time please start the voice of the examiner tells us its time to start the test all the testees turnover their test papers and the test begins either way i will answer as many questions as i can part 6 ah questions like that sure are unfair what do they mean by write the names of the enemy leaders that appear in levitan the food court inside the center i was lying on the table while making a pathetic voice the written test was broken into different sections and we finally finished after a few hours even if i was released from a task of using my brain i was still sighing because of the contents of the test i answered most of the questions about basic knowledge regarding devils except there was a question
regarding magical levitan and i was astonished there was a question where i had to write down the names of the leaders of the enemy organisations my point is how the fuck should i know also a question about chichiryutei oppaidragon appeared as well it became a question about the recent event that occurred in the underworld questions about khaosbrigade appeared as well since im like a victim from them i could answer them easily since i know about them more than most of the higherups well i didnt include any information that can not be known by the public though seriously i dont know whether the underworld is proper or improper isesama i have brought another cup of tea ravel has brought another cup of tea for me she seriously is a good girl to be expected from my manager thank you ravel thanks to you my written test didnt become a mess oof course i will be troubled if you dont pass since i became your manager oh shes in a tsuntsun modei didnt have that many blank answers i have quite a lot of confidence in it thats my true response it was certainly hard the answers
also had to be written in devilletters but i wasnt scared because the questions everyone taught me appeared as well im glad i studied like hell maybe whats most important in a promotion test is receiving a recommendation thats why there arent that many people taking the test this food court doesnt have many people in it even though its huge but still i still did quite well in the written test even if i barely failed for the written test i think i can cover it with the practical test so the practical is next kiba says it while twitching his upperbody yeah its the test category im really good at i heard that it will occur on the roof of this stadium ravel says it while reading through the documents araara getting heated up is good but it is not good for you to overdo it okay akeno says that to me sensei also said that i shouldnt try that hard for the practical as well but its a test so i should try hard i think this is the test where i can gain the most points in while this was occurring the time for the practical
test arrived the three of us split up from ravel once again and went to the roof while wearing a jersey the place was like a spacious gymnasium the participants all changed into clothes where they could move around easily in and they were warming up their bodies in their own way yosh i will also warm up my body then i start to sprint from where i was standing and begin to sprint around the running track while i was stretching my body with kiba and akenosan the examiners gathered and began to call our numbers we attached a badge that had our number on it to our jersey then one of the examiners gave us an explanationthe practical is quite simple we will have the participants battle each other we will have everyone draw a number and that will decide who you will battle oh thats simple and easy to understand so i just have to win that then the battle will be looked as a whole so even if you lose to your opponent you will not necessarily lose the opportunity to pass obviously winning the battle will allow you to get more points though but we
will look at the battle in depth so if you have the three satisfactory criteria of heart technique and body we will allow you to get points that will be the equivalent of what you showed try to have the battle to be as good as possible please the rule is simple fight the opponent with the power you have using weapons will be allowed you will fail if your opponent dies but if the death occurred due to an accident then we the examiners will decide the outcome please read the documents you have with you regarding about death by accident next is explanation of the rules continues yeah yeah so basically i have to show a good match to the examiners then wait what do you mean by good battle i held my head down by the depth of the battle ii all of the battles i had until now were all fist fights or fights like an ape ive never done a battle with demonicpowers or relying on techniques the examiner also gave an additional explanation now people who are a pawn are able to promote during the match with the special approval promotion card dispatched by
this test center hee so you can promote huh i never knew that there were special approval promotion cards used by this center is it a derivation of the card rias gave to asia when we went to the schooltrip i heard that ajuka beelzebubsama dispatched special promotion cards to places like this of course beelzebubsama is the only one who can make them and making copies of them is said to be impossible kiba explained it to me like that so beelzebubsama is the only one who can make something like this then how amazing is that person in terms of technology you can say that he surpasses azazelsensei it looks alright as long as we dont kill the opponent for the practical test unlike the highclass promotion test midclass promotion test does not require strategies that are based on tactics so it is quite simpleakenosan says there is a strategy test for the highclass promotion test wwell that was to be expected since you will be receiving the evilpieces that will allow you to make your own group having a test to test your brain would be obvious im screwed if i pass the midclass promotion test then
i will also have to study about strategies though no matter how hard i think using a strategy would be impossible for me the examiners explanation finished and it became time to draw we put our hands inside the box and took out a ball that has a number on it these things are quite similar to the human world well the ones who come here are mostly formerhumans so they are probably making it more familiar and easier for us to understand oh so my number is 4 looks like it will be one of the earlier matches kiba got 26 and akenosan got 32 oh looks like everyone was separated i wouldnt know what to do if we had to fight each other but looks like that wont be happening looks like their matches will be near the end the matches will occur by two pairs fighting at once first 1 and 2 3 and 4 will start their matches are you serious its my match already that was quick looks like my match will start before i get ready looks like im first do your best isekun can definitely do it i received a cheer from kiba
and akenosan ii will be going then while being a bit nervous i entered the circular battlefield made by demonic power what will happen now triaina cant do a combo even if we can promote it seems like cheating if i keep on changing once i promote i need to finish the match with that then maybe i should use the normal queen truequeen is still unstable so its not in a condition where i can use it but if we have to show our strength for this test then maybe i should use it while i was thinking the devil who was to be my opponent appeared its a medium height and medium built man lookingat him he doesnt seem to be flowing with lots of aura but this person is also a devil who has the strength to come to this test i cant let my guard down the examiner came in and looked at both of us both of you are ready then both me and my opponent nod the examiner raised his hand up and then put it down please start it started i made my gauntlet appear and started the countdown promotion queen what i
chose was the usual queen i often use either way i cant use truequeen unless i get into balancebreaker if thats the case then i will promote the usual queen and fight in my usual balancebreaker i have been training a lot with it even though its not triaina theres no way it wont be effective ha the opponent man made his hand glow with demonicpowers and shot huge orbs of flames looks like his attacks with demonicpowers are quite something if he is a sacred gear possessor then he will reveal it after this attack then i will go into balance breaker before that freezing archaeopteryx cold chills were surrounding the mans area ice started to gather in the air and it turned into a gigantic bird so its a sacred gear he made a gigantic bird using his sacred gear i waited for the countdown of my balance breaker while evading the giganticbirds intense attack and the demonicpower attacks shot by the man my weak point is this naked state i am currently in before the balancebreaker but because i opened the path to truequeen the countdown needed for me to turn into balance breaker is also reduced
yes this is where the real fight starts balance breaker red aura envelops my body and it shapes into the shape of armour boosted gear scalemail pawhile expanding both my dragon wings i charged my power i cant lose i will win and pass this promotion test jet goooooooooon i flew up to my opponent while thrusting the boosters on my back my opponent cant even react to my speed i can do this i pushed my fist forward to hit straight at him anyway this is my first blow don it destroyed the gigantic ice bird with ease and my punch continues to go towards him the opponent created defence magic circle in front of him but he couldnt withstand my punch and flew far to the back of the stadium dooooooooooon he crashed into the wall and went through it i stood still while thrusting my hand forward ara that person flew back more than i thought its not a punch where i used my boosted powers but it wasnt a punch that i was holding back either one of the examiners went towards the opponent whom i punched quickly i can hear the voices of other participants
who were watching the match yyou must be kidding me what power i see he surpasses the level of average lowclass devils greatly i can only say that his opponent was unlucky hes a monster if its just power isnt he a hightier of highclass devil so this is the power of sekiryuutei who defeated the evilgod loki and sairaorg bael i heard things like thatummmm i was troubled by how to respond i used my power to the fullest because i didnt want to fail and i thought that i cant let my guard down since my opponent is also a devil who is taking the promotion test the examiner returns from the broken wall while carrying my opponent who seems to be unconscious that examiner shakes his head to the examiner who is in charge of my match that examiner confirms it and says it loudly number 4 hyoudou issei wins eh tthis is the end of the practical are you serious i dont have to do anything more i could only stand there astonished because of the victory i gained easily we finished our practical and made ravel start a communication magiccircle so we can report to
sensei ssensei about the practical oh what happened im at the restaurant of the hotel in which we made reservations and drinking alcohol even at noon alcohol at noon again you sure know how to have fun no thats not what i mean its about the practical test wwell all of us me kiba and akenosan didnt have any trouble but more like it was you were overwhelming right i nod to sensei who is grinning ah yes sensei makes a sigh of course you guys have abnormal strength among lowclass devils and the ones going to the test have the powers of hightiers of midclass devils you guys have the power of highclass devils especially you ise who can use triaina and truequeen can release a power that isnt that much different from those with more power than that well i could say the same for sairaorg thoughi didnt know i so we became that strong not just me but kiba and akenosan also gained victory with overwhelming strength for the test instead i feel sorry because i went too far and destroyed the stadium they achieved victory while holding back their power not to destroy the stadium so
this is what he means by not fighting seriously it will cause harm to the stadium if we go too seriously because of the power difference between us and the other participants and i might have killed my opponent because of it if i think like that then i put too much energy into the match bbut my head was full with the things like the feeling of not wanting to fail and that i cant let my guard down the opponents you guys have been facing are the vali team which are full of legendary guys evil god loki and fenrir from northen europe and the ultimate longinus you know fighting guys like that while returning with everyone alive is something that isnt normal its a level where it would be said that you guys are abnormal at least in the gremory team you kiba akeno xenovia and rossweisse are strong guys with the power of highclass devils koneko who is starting to learn the power of sennjutsu will also reach the power parallel to a highclass devil soon ii see we went through lots of crisis so we greatly surpassed average midclass devils yeah if i think about
it our opponents were abnormal guys and i have been training hard so i wont lose i realised it again we became insanely strong even so the enemies who come after us have powers beyond that so my head is about to go nuts she sure has luck meeting with you guys the woman you fell for that is sensei says it as if hes depressed yes rias is the best woman there is of course the meeting rias and i had is something very special thanks to that i met with rias and everyone else hey rias ise said rias is the best woman there is sensei says it with a lecherous voice to another person whwhwhwhwh is rias nearbyhhey sensei why are you telling her haha rias became so red after hearing you say that man you guys are in a burning relationship shit tears are flowing out of my eyes looks like i will master being single damn it ah senseis voice had a bit of hatred in it even so dont play with me and rias because its embarrassing please let us taste our life peacefully sensei continues after changing back the topic well i also
said it to rias just now that there is no reason for rias to go through intense training to get strong riastraining if i remember she was quite upset that she couldnt do much against the fight with regulus but it was just that her opponent was a bit too much since it was a rare longinus that could move on its own it was also a demoniccreature that represented the king of lions one of the weapons the woman you fell for has is the fortunate meetings she has the grade that the gremoryteam has isnt something that other highclass devils have though it seems that guy raiser also said that this is something in which you cant teach others you need something like this since you were born and things like that will continue on as well in my case i want to praise the high chance of survival i mentioned before to survive crisis with everyone alive is a level that surpasses miracles a level that surpasses miracles i think i can understand that i also think its great that members like this gathered and survived through these crisis together anyway the test is over right use
the transport magiccircle at the center to get to this hotel the result isnt out yet but lets celebrate here the communication with sensei ended there and all of us took a breath great work isekun akenosan kiba says it to me and akenosan with a smile looks like we can relax until the result is out no akenosan for me i cant relax for the exam as well i made a sigh and kiba says it to mesekiryuutei who wielded his power greatly for the promotion test looks like he cant use that power for the exam akenosan and ravel chuckled at kibas sarcasm yeah yeah im just a power idiot like you saylife 3 the rebellious heroes part 1 so good job on your test cheers sensei gulped his drink after saying that how much has this drunken governor been drinking since noon the four of us moved to the hotel where we were given a relief from the fatigue of the test at the restaurant we reserved at the restaurant everyone in the occult research club except gasper and rossweissesan was gathered everyone has already started eating food so i started filling myself immediately after seeing the
gorgeously prepared food how was it i was asked by rias who is sitting next to me umm yes both the tests were worth the time this is all thanks to everyone who helped me but for the practical i overdid it i smashed my opponent with the power of sekiryuutei and i also made a hole in the test stadium you dont have to worry about it because we will pay for the damage to the broken wall but you cant go serious against midclass devils if you happen to have an argument okay theres quite a difference in power between yours and theirs at this current point in time i was warned by rias yes i am reflecting on my actions i was shocked because i never could have imagined that there was that much of a difference between me and other lowclass devils if you look at strength im a highclass devil huh i cant really feel it though no i do realize my strength but i still cant feel that i have a power where i can stand on equal grounds to the noble devils i beat highclass devils like raiser and diodora by relying on
the flow so i never thought about how strong i am among devils i just trained like crazy in order to make sure i wouldnt lose against the enemies who are after me and in order to catch up to vali ddraig then laughed inside me kukuku in your case you are already abnormal by possessing me and your target is also the strongest hakuryuukou of all time your target was already too high to begin with even so you continued to use your powerso its only natural that you would surpass other devils without realising it by the end of summer you had already surpassed your master rias gremory that woman isnt weak either the growth rate of sekiryuutei was too overwhelming even so my growth rate is slow compared to the past possessors right that part alone makes me want to cry its certainly slow but comparing you who is showing a completely different growth process than that of the sekiryuutei who came before you is a bit though the key to that growth is tits haaaaaa sekiryuuteidono has made a sigh maybe i should stop this discussion here then i saw a scene that made me smile
here konekosan you should eat this and this i can eat it myself even if you dont grab it for me im not looking after you because i want to isesama will be sad if you are not energetic i understand i will eat thank you no thank you as well if you dont become energetic i wont be able to compete against you i saw a conversation like that happening between ravel and konekochan they are opening up to each other even though they still argue a lot that is a good thing i shall look at ddraig at the corner of the restaurant there is ophis who is staring at me she was stuffing her mouth with pasta if the restaurant staff finds out that she is the boss of the terrorists serious things will happen obviously this is kept a secret it seems like kuroka and le fay are also eating sweets in the corner of the restaurant fenrir isnt showing itself but its probably hiding behind le fay what a skillful wolf well it is forbidden to bring pets inside a hotel waitthe worst creature to be a pet is kuroka is an exileddevil who is
on the wanted list in the underworld so she hides her cat ears and tails while wearing a similar robe to the oneworn by le fay though the colour is different she is also wearing sunglasses shes also changing the ki flow so people who can normally sense them wont notice them and as a result they wont be caught that easily shes also using it on le fay and ophis and that is one of the reasons why they arent being viewed as suspicious people well if its kuroka and them who havent been caught up until now they wont be caught here either but i think i can understand it now the reason why they appear in unexpected places is because they have the ability to sneak around like this if i think back my comrades didnt realize it at all when they suddenly appeared at my house so in that area they are superior to us when i was thinking about that the drunken sensei says this to kiba ise kiba both of you are extraordinary even among the gremory group you say we areextraordinary azazelsensei nods at kibas words im saying that you guys are young
devils who hold outrageous potential ise doesnt have any talent but he is a man who possess the sekiryuutei he raised his power in a different way than all previous sekiryuuteis and finally managed to awaken a power that is the total opposite to juggernautdrive even if kiba gained additional powers afterwards your talent is very high and both of you are still in the middle of your growth period its an unimaginable talent to awaken two balancebreakers on top of that both of you train with each other and are growing even stronger maybe you guys will become ultimateclass devils before rias even has her professional debut becoming an ultimateclass devil before having a professional match i was already shocked from the talk about midclass promotion so if that happens i might pass out and make bubbles out of my mouth and be confused for 10 days having your servant be a midclass devil before your debut is abnormal so in terms of that we might become a point of praise for rias kiba then says it shyly i am blessed right next to me the heavenlydragon isekun is there for a training opponent i cant ask for a
better partner and we are still in the middle of growing sparring against isekun alone is an honour how can he say such embarrassing things so openlydont say embarrassing thing with a smiley face geez im also gaining a lot from our training because my opponent is a genius techniquetype like you since my weakpoint is techniquetypes when i said that sensei shook his head no you also have another weakness more like an exposure the weakness of the powerful triaina and truequeen is stamina itself using either of them involves consuming great amounts of stamina and aura ise right now how long can you maintain the truequeen form the truth is the power is unstable so there are times when the form disappears after one hit controlling it is very hard yes that truequeen is very hard to control what is necessary for stabling the truequeen is increasing the specs during the other triaina forms if i want to increase the power output and defence of my truequeen form it is necessary for me to continue using triainarook until i get used to it if i want to increase the speed of truequeen then its triainaknight if its the
cannon then its triainabishop the basis for improving truequeen is that i need to improve the specs of each of the other forms thats how it is made in order to increase the strength of truequeen i need to train each of the triaina pieces the awakening of triaina in kyoto the awakening of truequeen during the bael match thanks to that the original power of heavenlydragon was released and it seems like the limit of my sacred gear increased several fold whats left now is for me to train and reach even greater heights even if the limit of the sacred gear increased since the possessor which is me is really weak then i have to get there step by step i have to get used to each of the forms of triaina and at the same time increase their powers truequeen is like an overall form the improved results will all reflect to the truequeen the reason why it is unstable right now is because i still need a lot of training i probably have to improve the usual balancebreaker form and triaina forms thats what i realised after the fight with sairaorgsan it means that im still
lacking in my training for the abilities of each of the forms maybe understanding that will relate to decreasing the huge stamina usage thats what i thought but sensei says something that put that idea away even if you were able to stabilize the power it might not solve the high consumption its a new power that doesnt hurt either the body or soul buteither way the consumption is intense it must consume more stamina and aura because it doesnt eat away at your life span or put your body in any danger so it has a high consumption because it doesnt have the price that would cut down my lifespan this is the answer i found by choosing a power other than juggernautdrive hmmmm i need to find a way to make up for the high consumption at this rate it will be impossible to fight in triaina or truequeen form during a long battle my opponents are all legendary beings it wont be a problem if it is a short battle but my opponents wont let me defeat them right away so it will be natural for me to prepare for long battles as well the time limit
for my usual balancebreaker form increased quite a lot so it wont disappear unless something extreme happens though that very thing is triaina itself if i use a combo it will consume a large portion of my stamina the fatigue i get following the battle isnt normal but its better than juggernautdrive which would continue to go berserk until i die then i thought about it so i asked sensei oh yeah the independent longinus that is under sairaorgsan called regulus can also do something like juggernautdrive didnt you tell me that sacred gears with strong creatures or dragons sealed inside them can do something similar to juggernautdrive judging from the system it is possible if its regulus nemea or a creaturetype sealed in sacred gear it will be called breakdown the beast which is written as beast of domination in japanese though the heavenlydragons juggernautdrive is more powerful that is special well these are very dangerous so you shouldnt use them even if you can just like juggernautdrive it will drain your life force and eventually kill you after going berserk ah so its the same then it will be hard to use the longinus need to be reported
to the higherups of the three great powers when they are found due to the alliance right but sensei didnt know that the lion was under sairaorgsan isnt that a breach in the alliance done by the bael side i had doubts about that the higherups of heaven and the underworld who searched and have surveillance on longinus possessors that lionregulus nemea would be siding with the devils side so i thought it would be natural for sirzechssama and sensei to receive a report about it i dont think that sairaorgsan would keep quiet about it on purpose i started to think that there might be something behind it sensei then says after sighing it seems like sirzechs also didnt know about it it sounds like those guys from the greatking faction told sairaorg to hide the identity of his pawn but sairaorg was insistent in telling the maou about it if he is to be the next heir of his house then his actions will be restricted by the current head on top of that the greatking faction members were telling him to hide his identity completely even in the rating game even if he was to send it
out they told him not to reveal its identity but it came out in the end and he revealed its identity it seems like sairaorg reached his limit of keeping quiet about it it seems like he was planning to use it whenever an opportunity to use it appeared nobody expected the last game to go like that but it was revealed because of that thanks to that the greatking faction members are being questioned a lot by the maoufactions you know though the grigori and the heavens also made a complaint to the devils side due to the alliance as well so something like that happened during that match for the higherups of the greatking faction to tell sairaorgsan not to use the lion but sairaorgsan didnt have a second thought about using the lion for the head to head battle i just need to pray that it wont turn into trouble like what happened with the oldmaou faction so does that mean im under the maoufaction then to put it specifically a longinus possessor who belongs to the luciferside man this is a hassle ah theres one more thing i remembered after hearing about longinus and abilities sensei
how about truelonginuss truth idea does that also have a phenomenon similar to juggernautdrive or breakdown the beast does it also have a creature sealed in it its not that a creature is sealed in that spear whats sealed inside it is like a will of the god from the bible a will that also gives an incredible image to me hmmm so the ultimate spear also has an unbelievable thing hidden in it thena spear that can kill a being called god the beginning longinus the god from the bible left it in the current world and as a humans ability the sacred gear though the reason for it is split between different opinions in my organisation something like even if god died the believers can spread their teachings and the weapon can be used for invading since it can kill the gods from other religions also something like a defence weapon for his believers in case of an attack from the gods of other religions or it was just made for no particular reason like that there are different opinions the heavens dont have a conclusion either either way other powerful sacred gears were found after that spear
and things like longinus were defined so the beginning longinus huh my longinus was defined after that spear in this age each of the longinus are showing different changes than in the past we are in a flow where its not weird for other longinus besides the 13 longinus to appear maybe a 14th or 15th longinus could be found sensei says something like that a new longinus might be born as one who has possession of a longinus i can understand that this would be very dangerous theyre already dangerous to begin with so its scary if more were to appear from the discussion till now it seems like they will appear as an enemy so im becoming frightened it seems like asia who is sitting close by is thinking about something she hasnt eaten much either she has only been drinking sips of juice whats wrong asia when i talked to her asia says it quietly i thought that i should understand more about the sacred gear is it to increasethe healing ability when i asked her she nodded i heard that gasperkun went to azazelsenseis research institute to know more about the sacred gear so i thought
i should go there next after that match against bael everyone started to face up to their powers and even gasper who is always behind went to the grigori in order to train himself but asias healing ability is already powerful it shows remarkable support both at close and longrange how many times have we been saved by it even so asia seems like she isnt satisfied with it she has a more serious expression than usual asia who is always putting on a gentle smile has strong eyes right now sensei i would like to ask you two questions is it possible for twilight healing to attain balancebreaker am i also able to attain balancebreaker i would like to know these two answers hearing asias question sensei took a gulp of alcohol and then opened his mouth for the first question there is it is predicted that there is a balancebreaker state for twilight healing its also yes for the second question as well if you are close to the sekiryuutei ise who makes lots of irregular phenomenon occur then by training you will be able to reach it depending on how hard you work its also possible to
make it into a subspecies balancebreaker depending on your taste as well but asia your ability has already reached perfection asia seems a bit in doubt at senseis words what do you mean by that its just like i said your healing ability is already high and mastered just like you can see because of your ability ise and the others have overcome dangerous situations countless times i could say that you are already using your sacred gear to the fullest even comparing you with other twilighthealing possessors your level of healing ability time needed to heal and other parts are all topnotch even the healing from longrange shows a result that far surpasses average numbers even if you were to get balancebreaker it will just be a scale up of those aspects sensei gave such huge praises to asia i also thought the same asias ability is quite high even at the current point as long as asia doesnt get targeted we can fight with relief thats because even if we were to be injured we know that we can return to the battlefield as soon as we are healed by asia being so highly praised by sensei asia
has a complicated expression instead of wanting to become strongerasia you are the keystone of this group a healing member is valuable and important out of the gremory group no out of everyone here you are the most important one during battle you will know that if you ask everyone else and you yourself should realise that as well right asia nods at senseis words then do you know what is your weakness is it the fact that im not useful besides healing no its a bit different you should just concentrate on healing you can leave the rest to ise and the others but you will still be targeted we will receive a major blow if we lose our healing support if that happens we would need an attacker who can protect you or the rear guard would have to defend you that would disturb the formation and could lead to breaking the rhythm of the battle your weakness is that you dont have a method to protect yourself so what you should improve is the ability where you can defend yourself yeah maybe it would suit you to use a method like barriers illusions demonicpowers to summon or
even magic if you make a pact with creatures who can act as your shield and summon them then ise and others dont have to defend you rias asia made a pact with the hard to please spright dragon right rias nods at senseis question yes it has become asias familiar the hightier dragon baby that asia caught at the forest of familiars it plays with asia at home quite often when that grows it will become the same size as old man tannin so it will be scary from now because it will become more than 10 meters big what should we do about its food unexpectedly maybe she has an ability that can enslave creatures it was totally a blind spot how about you start meeting with lots of legendary creatures and try to make pacts with them maybe it will go smoothly if its a creature that can act as a shield sensei started to talk by himself with enjoyment about improving asias ability but i agree that asia summoning a creature who could become her shield would be useful at the last group battle during the match against bael the reason we didnt let asia participate
is because we didnt havethe flexibility to protect her since asia would be healing us she would definitely be targeted and we didnt have the flexibility to both attack and defend so it wouldve been too high of a risk if asia can summon creatures that can act as her shield then that last fight might have gone differently somehow since we arrived a plan for improving everyone in the group has been established though there are still members who are keeping their improvement plans a secret but the reflection we had during the bael match will greatly influence our growth even gasper and rossweissesan who arent here will return to us even stronger than before i cant lose to them either i need to get even stronger since all my rivals are incredibly strong do my best me then it happened right as i made a new resolve an uncomfortable feeling hit me i felt a nasty sensation all over my body the atmosphere changed immediately and i immediately felt a sensation like i was teleported to a different place even though the scenery around me looks exactly the same sensei also felt a sensation similar to mine and
made a serious face as he looked around the restaurant kiba did the same then there was a shadow that was moving closer to us its kuroka she has her cat ears and tails out and her ears are twitching her outfit has changed to the usual kimono it looked like she has a sarcastic smile aryarya looks like vali was ignored nya looks like the bingo came here vali bingo the moment when kuroka said things that i couldnt understand a familiar mist is surrounding us and it was covering the surroundings as well part 2 we left the restaurant that was inside the hotel everyone is here including ophis kuroka and her comrades as well i started the countdown for balance breaker while i was runningthere isnt even a single person in the building no matter how i think about it its that phenomenon it was the same as that mist i experienced twice in kyoto we were transported by force he created the exact same hotel we were in before in an artificial dimension and transported just us xenovia who is next to me shouts ise is this perhaps yeah xenovia it must be a mist i
cant forget even if i wanted to the only one who can do this is the mistuser who appears in my head we arrived at a spacious lobby in the lobby where theres not a single trace of people there are two men openly sitting on a nearby black sofa then a fireball flew towards our direction its aimed at irina and asia but the fireball didnt hit the two ophis acted as their shield and made the fireball vanish with ease ophis protected asia and irina tthank you very much ophis didnt react to asias gratitude but i looked back at the sofa a youth who is wearing a robe on top of a familiar school uniform and a black haired youth who is wearing a chinese outfit on top of the same school uniform were gazing at us the chinese outfit youth is tapping his spear on his shoulder while sitting down and then said it to us it has been a while sekiryuutei and governor azazel the last time we met was in kyoto i made my greetings right away its the return of durandal from the other day cao cao i spit out the guys name
the holyspear wielder who has the strongest longinus the leader of the herofaction of the khaos brigade the main culprit who attacked us in kyoto the wound i gave to his eye is gone completely it was a wound where it wouldnt be weird for him to have lost his sightthere must be something about it i should keep it in mind but they shot a fireball at asia and irina all of a sudden is it payback for xenovias attack back in kyoto cao cao applauds the match against bael the other day was magnificent the intense fist fight between two people wearing balance breaker armors it was a fight in which people who love to battle would be ecstatic about so i will give my praise gremory team congratulations on being the number 1 youth devil team they are good servants rias gremory it truly is frightening should i be honoured by being praised by one of the leaders of the terrorists i do feel complicated how are you doing cao cao rias put on a sarcastic smile while staying on maximum alert yeah im doing alright it was only a short time when i saw you back
in kyoto so this might be our first meeting i was astonished at the sudden summoning it certainly was a stimulating appearance dont say that it embarrasses me even remembering about it rias puts her hands in front because of cao caos words and is telling him to stop yeah even if it was my fault she appeared in kyoto in an outrageous way it certainly must be bad since that was their first encounter so what was the reason for you making this field in another dimension and transporting us it must be a good for nothing plot i guess when sensei asked that cao cao looked behind us he was looking at ophis ya ophis i was wondering where you went with vali but for you to be here i certainly didnt anticipate that kuroka stood in front of ophis nyahahaha we are also shocked nya i thought youd head to where vali is we sent a different team over there they are probably battling them now what are they saying i couldnt follow either of their conversations i do know that valis team and cao caos team are againsteach other while we were suspicious of the situation
le fay suddenly raised her hand she made a cough and explained to us joyfully at the same time an ash gray wolf appeared from her shadow and glared at cao cao well this started from two things the first is that ophissama took great interest in sekiryuutei oppaidragonsan valisama found out about it so he offered to set up a meeting between the two through his own connections i know about that thats why ophis made a shocking visit to my house le fay had one finger up then put up her second finger the second reason is that valisama got a hold of some information which said that someone is after ophissama from the shadows to find out about it we decided to lure them out if we are lucky we can fight directly with the people who get in our teams way by using ophissama as a bait so it means that le fay shyly pointed at cao cao those people over there are after ophissama and us so we thought that they would take action if valisama took ophissama out of headquarters and we could crush them when they came after us but there was no
reason for having ophissama be in danger so valisama took bikousama who disguised himself as a fakeophissama and we took the realophissama to oppaidragonsans house wawait a second hearing le fay i looked at cao cao ophis and sensei wait wait wait wait i know that valis team and the herofaction are on bad terms i also know that ophis is being targeted but the one who is after ophis iscao cao so does it mean that the herofaction is after ophis wwhat does this mean ddont they all belong to khaos brigade more like isnt ophis their boss all of us present the gremory group and the others are shocked the ones who are calm are sensei kuroka le fay cao cao and georg cao cao started nodding his head hearing le fay and is tapping his spear on his shoulder its vali we are talking about i knew that he wont just go around taking ophis with him so we knew that he would be using ophis as bait to lure us out but we also knew that vali wont be using ophis just as bait weknew that ophis was interested in the changes of this generations hakuryuukou
and sekiryuutei so we thought that something like this might happen so we split into two groups one group went after vali while georg and i would check on sekiryuutei just as we thought ophis was here so we ended up meeting each other like this im still confused but judging from the story vali tried to lure out cao cao without using the real ophis but with a fake ophis and cao cao was suspicious of valis movements and came here thinking that ophis was with us his guess was right and ophis is standing over there cao cao is after me ophis asks while twitching her neck yeah ophis we need ophis but we determined that we dont need the current you i do not understand i would not lose to cao cao that would be the case you are too powerful to tell the truth i dont know what would happen if i took you head on so lets fight a bit cao cao stood up and spun around his spear skilfully piiiiiiiin the tip of his spear opened and a really bright light blade formed it had an intense light that gave me chills like always
to us devils it is the ultimate holy spear fu cao cao disappeared fast he disappeared without making even the slightest movement stab when he appeared cao caos spear was thrust deeply into ophiss stomach a critical blow if it was a devil that stab would have killed it right away cao cao then shouts while putting power into the spear he holds shine the spear that destroys godskaaaaaaa at the same time he thrust his spear enormous amounts of light were emitted this is bad nya le fay when kuroka said that both she and le fay started to mumble something then a mist of darkness was created around us it is a mist that greatly reduces the amount of light its very dense so please dont breath it in its poisonous to our body but we wont be able to reduce the light of the holyspear unless we do something like this also its a double layer done by me and le fay nya the moment le fay and kuroka gave us an explanation like that the torrents of enormous light created from the holyspear expanded throughout the hotel i understood that the light created from the holyspear
was intense even from inside the mist if we didnt have this mist i wonder how much damage would we devils have received just from the torrents the light of the holyspear stops the mist of darkness also disappears and i looked at cao cao and ophis ophis still had a spear pierced through her stomach but there was no blood flowing out from her stomach and she also didnt have any expression of pain on her face cao cao takes out his spear slowly ophiss stomach had a hole but there were no traces of blood the hole disappears as if nothing happened so she didnt take any damage even with the light of that holyspear cao cao then says it with an astonished face an instant kill attack if it was a devil i even put a lot of power in it so even other beings would vaporise it would have taken half of the power of one of the gods whom are weak against this spear cao cao then looks at me did you see that sekiryuutei this is ophis you can not give it a critical wound even with the ultimate longinus the damage went through
but to take down the power of infinite is not possible even with this spear since ophis herself is infinite does it mean that no matter what kind of attack you do with that spear it is useless so this is a dragon thatrepresents infinite cao cao continues while tapping his spear on his shoulder she wont even fight back against me who just attacked her the reason is simple thats because she can kill me anytime she wants to thats why she wont do it even if i do something like this basically shes not interested in anything besides greatred out of the top 5 worlds strongest not including greatred the strongest one is ophis and there is a huge gap between her and the second strongest where you could say that she is on a totally different level this is what the embodiment of infinite means these guys cao cao is after ophis right then i thought about it then what are they planning to do with this infinite even if it is cao cao it would be impossible to defeat her right or can he beat her if he uses balancebreaker or the thing called truthidea no
judging from how cao cao spoke hes basically saying that he cant beat her then what seems like a transport magiccircle is created below kuroka and le fay is it a magic circle created by them kuroka then says it with a smile nyahaha we have connected it while you were doing your side show lets do it le fay its about time that we have to call him when the ashgrey wolf fenrir positioned itself on the magiccircle the magiccircle made an intense glow and reacted when the light stopped instead of fenrir that guy was standing there instead a bishounen with dark silver hair and blue eyes vali when i thought that the transport magiccircle was activated instead of fenrir vali appeared good work kuroka le fay its been a while since we met facetoface cao cao cao cao who is confronting vali smirks at his appearance vali this is a shocking summoning le fay then says it while drawing a circle in the air with her rod i have called valisama here switching his location with fenrirchanvali then continues i made fenrir fight the other herofaction group members with bikou and the others in my place i
had predicted that cao cao would be coming here so i made sure i had insurance now lets finish things between us but coming here only with georg such a bold hero ah so there are transport methods like that as well this is my first time hearing about them so it must be a special magiccircle that was activated by kuroka and le fay but this guy vali he also predicted that cao cao would be coming here cao cao then smirks rather than being bold i thought that it would be enough with just me and georg looks like you are confident cao cao does it mean you have the socalled dragoneater as your trump card im guessing it is a sacredgear possessor who specialises in dragonslaying or a new longinus possessor cao cao shook his head to the sides hearing valis words no thats not it vali dragoneater is the codename we gave to a being that existed already we didnt create it it was already created god from the bible created that hearing that the youth wearing a robe georg speaks is it alright cao cao yeah its about time georg vali is here ophis is
here sekiryuutei is here the infinite dragongod and the two heavenlydragons a combination where we couldnt ask for more lets call it the time for opening the jar from hell has come roger that so the time to devour the infinite has come then georg who put on a smile made a gigantic magiccircle behind him in the spacious lobby zuoooooooo an intense vibration shook the entire hotel a very ominous aura was emitted from the magiccirclea cold air that gave me chills an intense pressure i had never felt before was coming from the magiccircle a pressure that freezes both my body and soul i feel like a frog that is being glared at by a snake this presence is an overwhelming evil intent only directed at a dragon ddraig also seems like he felt something and his voice is trembling ddraig is frightened what kind of being is there that can even frighten a heavenlydragon which is an embodiment of bravery then a gigantic ominous thing started appearing from the magiccircle head torso blackwings a cross someone was impaled into a cross restraint tools were intensely binding its body there were so many restraining tools placed all over
its body and there are creepy letters written on the tools there were ones that were placed on its eyes and there were tears of blood dripping from them the moment its whole body appeared from the magiccircle my breath stopped because of the bizarre existence it had the lowerbody of a snake no there are scales on it a skinny appearance like that of an asian dragon the upperbody of a fallenangel and lowerbody of a dragon on both hands tail and all over its body there were countless nails driven through even on its black wings just looking at its appearance tells me how painful it is a pebble fallenangel dragonthat is being restricted a crucifixation done to a criminal who has done something very serious it looks like it is the personification of anger from the one who judged it ooooooooooooooooooo a creepy voice emitted from the criminals mouth echoes throughout the lobby from its mouth covered in fangs there was blood and saliva coming out as well pain jealousy suffering resentment a sound that is mixed with all kinds of negative emotions you can tell it is a being that was judged by someone who harbored
great anger towards it there was a black aura and mist coming out of the fallenangel dragon that was spreading throughout the lobbya sensation where my skin is being poked with needlesa disgusting sensation that covers my whole body senseis eyes changed and his expression changed to that of anger tthis guy is to bring such a thing so you unsealed the seal of cocytus cao cao took a step forward and starts to speak as if he was reading a poem it says that it is the poison of god it says it is the evil intention of god a forbidden being that made the people in eden eat the fruit of knowledge the first crime that was judged by the dead god from the bible and still continues to be in effect dragoneater samael the angel that received the curse of god who hated dragons and snakes a dragon yes a dragon whose existence was eliminated from the record hearing the name of the restrained dragon everyone besides me put on a shocked face sensei what is that even i know that its dangerous just by looking at it i ask sensei do you know the story of
adam and eve yyeah i at least know about that werent they the first man and woman the ones who were at the garden of eden or something sensei begins to explain the one who turned into a snake and made adam and eve eat the fruit of knowledge is that that action brought the fury of god from the bible so god started to hate snakes and dragons to the extreme thats the reason why dragons are depicted as evil in many of the texts from the church he is a being that was made of the evil intentions of god because of gods hate a being who received many kinds of poisons and curses on his body naturally it is impossible for god who is sacred to have evil intentions thats why it has intense poison not only can it extinguish dragons but it can affect other things besides dragons so it was sealed in the depths ofcocytus the curse it received from god is the ultimate dragonslayer that alone makes him an existence that is a brutal dragonslayer a fallenangelsnakedragonthat was hated by god gods poison gods evil intent i understood that this thing was very dangerous
just by hearing the explanation what kind of monster did these guys bring gods evil intent and intense poison which is hatred towards dragons isnt this thing a very dangerous existence to me sensei then yells what is the olympian god who is in charge of the world of the dead thinking pperhaps cao cao smiles at senseis deduction yes we negotiated with hadesdono i was allowed to summon him while having many layers of restrictions on it that bastard he didnt like the fact that zeus was going to cooperate with other factions sensei spit it out with hatred so that skeletongod lent his hand to the herofaction no matter how you think about it it is a serious issue that will bring ruckus to the alliance he seems like he hates devils and fallenangels but to help a terrorist cao cao spins around his holyspear and then points at us so like that azazeldono vali and sekiryuutei the curse he has will devour and kill dragons he can kill dragons for certain its not on the same level as the dragonslayer holyswords you cant even compare them ascalon is like a toothpick to him hyoudou issei ascalon as
a toothpick no judging from this overwhelming hatred i feel that samaelsan is a dragonslayer that is on a different level from my ascalon what are you planning to do by using it are you trying to annihilate dragons no you guys are tryingophis cao cao smirks with amusement at senseis words he then clicks his fingersdevour her gyun something very fast went past us then gulp i heard a weird sound it sounded like something was gulped when i looked around there was a black block created at the place where ophis was standing a size big enough to envelop a person so thats what happened from the black block there was a tentacle growing out when i looked at where the tentacle was leading to it was connected to the fallenangel dragon that was pinned to the cross there was a very black tentacle his tongue growing out from his mouth samael gulped ophis i got confused at the sudden happening but i could tell that those guys were up to no good by having samael wrap ophis with its tongue hey ophis answer me i talk to the block but there isnt any response from ophis this
is bad im sure this is really bad yuuto cut it with riass command kiba creates a holydemonic sword in his hand and went slashing towards the black block but the black block devoured the holydemonic sword and made the blade of it disappear only half of the holydemonic sword was left in kibas hand it erased the holydemonic sword can this black block erase an attack itself kiba created another demonicsword and slashed it towards the tentacle samaels tongue but it achieved the same results as before when he went to cut it the part of the blade that touched it got erased and the tip of the blade got split in two half dimensionwhen vali made the wings of light appear divinedividing his surroundings got warped and all the things got reduced to half while making the sound of the sacred gear at the same time that is valis halving ability but it didnt have any effect on the black block or samaels tongue did he learn how to use that ability without turning into balancebreaker hows this then then vali shoots a wave of demonic power from his hand but it also got devoured by the black
block as if it was nothing it didnt even give any damage to the black block it doesnt even have a scratch or dent its no use even with vali then how about the power of destruction rias shoots it with enough demonic power to make things around her dissapear but it didnt do anything either is it stubbornly hard or does it have the power to avoid all attacks gulp gulp while making a creepy voice the tentacle attached to the block is getting bigger and is taking it towards samaels mouth it seems like it is absorbing something from ophis who is inside wait thats it cao cao did say devour it just before then i will just use the power of my balancebreaker and i made the boosted gear scalemail appear immediately and wore it quickly i also promoted to the usual queen when i was about to go hitting towards the block surrounding ophis sensei stops me ise dont take it on hes your ultimate natural enemy he cant be compared to vali that dragon must have the power to kill dragons easily i mean the situation is already bad since ophis cant even get out
of it the enemy is a dragon but dont use ascalon we dont know what will happen against the ultimate dragonslayer even if you say that something terrible will happen if ophiss caught by them right i shout then xenovia goes forward immediately and slashes down her durandal at samael the absolute wave from the holysword goes down towards samaelbang there was something that hit it to the side its cao caos holy spear you do a good attack from the start again xenovia of the durandal but theres no second time cao cao clicks his fingers i thought i attacked with good timing is my first strike with durandal easy to read xenovia asked i also think it was good timing but since she attacked first with durandal at kyoto its natural that they would be on alert cao cao did stop it easily but you sure like to give a hello attack dont you xenovia i wont say anymore than this then vali turns into his armour form while releasing white lights so my opponent is samael on top of that two hightier longinus possessors i have no complaints with valis word kuroka and le fay also made
a battle stance im not copying vali but i also made a battle stance the gremory team members also did the same sensei also enveloped his body with the armour of fafnir anyway theres one thing i know if attacks dont work on the block or samaels tongue then we have to hit his body its absolutely dangerous to have ophis taken by these guys of who we cant understand what they are thinking ravel you are a guest and my precious manager i cant have you dying on me so step back ravel nods and steps back with my request thats good the wife from the house of phoenix asked us to take care of ravel but that doesnt include battles that involve risking her life i promised her that i will protect ravel in the worst case scenario i have to at least make sure ravel escapes of course im not planning to let the others or myself die either looking at our battle stances cao cao put on a smile of enjoyment with you guys as my opponent it will be dangerous if i dont become serious since hades only allowed us to use samael once our
plan will fail if we dont decide it here georg i will leave the controlling of samael to you i will take care of these guysgeorg says it while controlling samael can you take the twoheavenly dragons the governor of fallenangels and the gremory team by yourself i will make it happen if i cant do something as simple as this then i basically have no right to hold this spear cao caos spear then makes a bright light balance breaker saying that something in cao caos body changes a ring of light that give out intense light appears behind him and 7 bowling ball sized balls floating up in the air appeared it was a silent balancebreaker until now i have seen many types of balancebreaker but this is my first time seeing something so silent and simple even the spear looks basically the same cao cao takes a step forward at the same time the 7 orbs around him move as well this is my true longinuss balancebreaker polar night longinus chakravartine though its still incomplete seeing cao cao sensei shouts a subspecies the balancebreaker that the previous truelonginus used until now was truelonginus geta demelung from the
name of it are you implying that you are the ideal ruler damn it even i dont know what those 7 orbs are i actually want to call myself the ideal ruler of heaven that sounds cooler right i dont understand what cao cao is saying but a subspecies of the ultimate holyspear what kind of ability does it have vali then says it after standing next to me careful that balancebalancebreaker has the ability called seven treasures and has 7 sacred gear abilities so there are abilities for each orb i got shocked at what he said seven not two or threeyeah seven each of those abilities is deadly though i only know three of them thats why its called the ultimatelonginus theres no doubt that hes the strongest out of pure humans yes among humans even vali says this much but the pressure coming out of his body is quite lower compared to samaels i was more nervous in the fight against sairaorgsan but i shouldnt let my guard down i was almost killed by him once in kyoto with the normal state holy spear that is cao cao then moves one of his hands forward one of
the orbs reacts and goes in front of his hand one of the seventreasures cakka ratana saying that the orb disappears and break the sound of something being destroyed violently echoes throughout the lobby when i looked around i saw that the exdurandal still held by xenovia got destroyed my exdurandal xenovia also couldnt react to the sudden action and her sword was destroyed the excalibur which was made into durandals sheath got broken hohohold on a sec it got destroyed like that what did the orb that just disappeared doand why did exdurandal get destroyed all of a suddennnnn noone could react to it and everyone was astonished at the exdurandal being destroyed that is the first one cakka ratanas ability is to destroy weapons the ones who can oppose this ability are those who are quite strong cao cao says then the next moment splash there was blood spurting from xenovias body thats because there was a hole in her stomachgough xenovia spits out blood from her mouth and falls down i can tell that its a critical wound with one glance i also made the chiyatsu calathana change into the shape of a spear and pierced her
stomach with it if you couldnt see that then that means you cant defeat me wielder of durandal hearing cao cao everyone spread out around the scene hurry with healing xenovia asia rias reacts right away and orders asia to heal asia was standing dazed looking at the fallen xenovia she soon realizes the situation and goes to xenovias aid xenoviasan noooooooo asia started the healing while crying out loud bastard this shit you hurt xenovia you hurt my comrade both me who was enraged andkiba went towards cao cao just like me kiba was also furious cao caooooooo i wont forgive you simultaneous attacks by me and kiba but cao cao easily dodged them with his holyspear and made another orb come to his hand itsutei ratana fu the orb went past us and straight towards rias and akenosan rias and akenosan react to it and try to attack but burst the orb reacts to cao caos word and it started to emit lights that envelop rias and akenosan ku with something like thisboth of them try to attack even though they are enveloped in light but rias and akeno only have their hands put forward both of them
looked at their hands with suspicious looks they try to attack again by putting their hand forward but like i thought nothing happened iis this perhaps itsutei ratana completely seals the unique power women have temporarily this also needs a certain level of strength or you wont be able to cancel it out with this three down rias akenosan and i get shocked at cao caos words he can seal womens powers if people with the strength of rias and akenosan cant oppose it then that means xenovia irina and asia cant either and if we have asia who can heal sealed then we are over xenovia is currently being healed if we have asia get sealed then xenovia will die cao cao then laughed loudly he had an expression of enjoyment of this battle fufufu defeating all of you in this limited space fancy attacks will give a negative effect on the complicated controlling of samael i will protect georg and samael with the minimum amount of movement that is necessary while i also go straight ahead by myself what a magnificently hard mission it is but kuroka and le fay have their hands glowing with demonicpowers and magic
and have them aimed at georg and samael they are aiming to attack when the guard is down then cao caos other orb heads to that direction you are in the way nyan kuroka tries to take down the orb with her other hand atsusa ratana it can teleport the person i choose after cao cao says that both kuroka and le fay disappeared from where they were out of my sight when i looked in a different direction kuroka and le fay were there so this is what he means by teleport i saw something outrageous when i found out about that ability kuroka and le fay who have their hands put forward their hands were directed towardsxenovia and asia the attacks they did were originally meant to be aimed at georg and samael but because of the ability their aim was altered the fire in their hands cant be stopped all of a suddendont mess around welsh sonicboost knight change star sonic i changed the evilpieces within me i purged off the armour and went towards asia with armour meant for high speed i wont let you shes my important asia with some attack like that to take
down asia not with your own attack but with valiteams attack i went in front of asia with highspeed and acted as her shield asia was so concentrated on healing xenovia that she didnt react to the attack yeah thats not a problem i will protect asia though i doubt i can withstand kuroka and le fays attack with this thin armour even so i will protect asia with my life dooooooooooooooooon along with a loud sound both their attacks hit me without mercy the impact and pain go through my whole body my thin armour gets completely destroyed by the powerful attacks i spit out blood because of the intense damage i received gaha i spit out large amounts of blood shit it hurtsdoesnt even express the pain im feeling because of their attacks i have my armour destroyed and took a critical wound to my body i have black burns from my chest to my stomach my flesh is torn and i have blood coming out of it damn it my weakness is the naked me and theres only flesh and blood underneath the armour i fall down lifelessly while falling down i can see cao cao who
seems to be smirking sekiryuutei i already know your powers it seems like you awakened to an unstable and more powerful ability in the match against bael though there are many ways to fight against it the combo of triaina is powerful but there is a slight time lag when you change the evilpieces if i attack with the correct timing for it i can take it down i can take you down in a few moves if i find out the strategy method bastard he completely understands the triaina and my weakness if an unexpected attack was to be shot towards thedefenceless asia i will definitely go to her aid with triaina knight that can move at high speed and the weakness of triainaknight is the thin armour knowing that he teleported kuroka and le fay who have high magic attacks in front of asia he also calculated that i would appear there he saw through my moves just by seeing it once i cant even be a challenge to him that is the obvious power difference between us isesan asia realises that i am in a critical condition and she tries to send an aura of healing while
shes healing xenovia but i need to have her continue healing xenovia dont asia im still okay heal xenovia first but isesan your stomach dont cry asia its just that the blood isnt stopping this wont kill me im on the ground but i see a gold armour and pure white armour valiiiiiiii come with me geez i just want to fight by myself vali complains but heads towards cao cao with sensei its high speed they closed the distance between cao cao immediately the spear of light that sensei holds and valis punch covered with demonic power are released towards cao cao at the same time a recital contest between the governor of fallenangels and hakuryuukou i can rise even higher if i can overcome this cao cao accepts this situation happily and dodges the high speed attack by sensei and vali by an inch he can dodge that cao cao is he really human he surpasses humans and superbeings the armourtype balancebreaker that is an embodiment of power accomplishes a magnificent powerup but because the powerup is too dramatic the aura leaks out of the armour a lot as a result its easy to predict how you will
attack next if i just read the flow of aura see sinceyou increase the attack of your weapons or fist the aura concentrates on those areas cao cao says that while dodging the weakness of armourtypes he looks at things like that how much of a strategy does he have against us then cao cao who dodged their attacks has his right eye glowing in golden light do you know about the evileye yes the special power that is inside the eye i also had that planted in me i had it replaced with the eye i lost against sekiryuutei its my new eye cao cao who dodged both sensei and valis attack looks down then senseis legs start to turn into stone medusas eye sensei makes a noise with his tongue after realizing the identity of his eye medusa even an idiot like me knows the female monster who turns anyone into stone with her hair made from snakes he implanted her eye in himself the 7 abilities holyspear and medusas eye how much power does this bastard cao cao have stab the holyspear pierces senseis stomach along with a nasty sound the golden armour crumbled easily and senseis
body spurt out blood guha what is this insane power he has sensei falls to the ground while coughing out blood cao cao says it while pulling out his spear well i did fight with you once so i know how to deal with you the weakness of that artificial sacred gear is that it cant reflect the power of fafnir to you azazel damn you cao caoooooo vali who became enraged by sensei being taken down releases an especially large block of demonic powers towards cao cao you were abandoned by your parents because they thought you were a monster and the one who picked you up and taught you how to use yourpower was governor azazel wasnt it are you enraged because the life saver who raised you got taken down the demonicpower shot released by vali even if its cao cao if he gets hit by it directly but one of the orbs went flying towards his shot mani ratana it can release the attack directed at me to someone else vali your demonicpower is enormous if i get hit i will die guarding against it is also hard but there is a way to ward it
off valis demonic shot got absorbed by the whirlwind created in front of the orb the whirlwind disappeared after absorbing all of it and a new whirlwind appeared in front of konekochan hold on a sec from cao caos explanation before he can redirect an attack aimed at him to someone else which means shit move move it my bodyyyyyyyy while dripping blood i got up while putting strength in my legs but gough i puked out blood from my mouth and fell down from the new whirlwind valis demonic shot that was absorbed before is released the powerful demonic shot was redirected towards konekochan idiot why arent you moving shironekuroka screams and goes between konekochan and valis attack to become her shield baaaaaaaang the sound of the explosion echoes throughout the lobby kuroka received a direct hit from valis shot that was redirected by cao cao towards konekochan kuroka falls while bleeding and has smoke coming out konekochan embraces her body right away wwhat were you standing all airheaded for kuroka says that with a voice that almost sounds like it is about to disappear neeneesama cao cao you took down my comrade with my own hands valis body
is enveloped with an aura filled with rage it looks like his anger is rising even more its my first time seeing him get mad this much and the cause for that is sensei and kuroka who were beaten vali you think too deeply about your comrades you look exactly the same as the sekiryuutei over there who is pathetically on the floor when did the twoheavenly dragons become that weak also i know that you cant grasp my ability because you have only seen a few of my abilities before thats why i attacked with the seventreasure ability that i havent shown you on purpose you should be glad with this the only one who knows all 7 abilities is you then i will also show you i the one who is about to awaken the twoheavenly dragons that that bastard vali he started saying the chant for the juggernaut drive cao cao then shouts at georg as if he realised it georg juggernautdrive might destroy this artificial space i knowsamael georg put his hand forward and created a magiccircle reacting to that the restraint on samaels right hand comes off oooooooooooooooooooooooooowhile making a creepy cry samaels right hand
is directed at vali buuuuuun vali is enveloped by a black thing at the same time the air rumbles it looks like the black block that is enveloping ophis oooooooooooooooooooooooooo when samael howled the black block bursts bashuuun at the same time that the block bursts vali also gets released but his armour also bursted along with the block and his body is covered with lots of blood gough vali falls to the floor of the lobby you must be kidding me that vali that hakuryuukou my ultimate rival was taken down without doing anything is that how dangerous that dragoneater monster samael is looking at vali who is on the floor cao cao makes a sigh how is it vali the taste of gods poison its something that is too much for a dragon right if you were to use juggernautdrive here and rampage it will affect the control of samael so i will have it finished here then im just a weak human so i can only do attacks aiming for peoples weak points my bad vali cao cao vali looks up at cao cao with hatred even that ophis cant do anything against samael samael was the
only natural enemy for ophis looks like our prediction was correct cao cao says it while tapping his shoulder with his spear the black block enveloping ophis the tentacle still looks like it is absorbing something from ophis ummm so how many are down with this with sekiryuutei hakuryuukou governor azazel defeated the big threats are down i would say the onlyones left are kiba of the holydemonic sword michaels angel and le fay le fay doesnt know what to do in front of cao caos overwhelming power irina also shed tears of anger while holding on to the sword of light how dare you xenovia isekun my comrades you cant irina if you go recklessly you will get killed rias stops irina who seemed like she was going ahead without thinking if we dont do something about the seventreasures then all of our attacks will be countered back at us the seven orbs have the same size and shape so its hard to tell which one he will be using and it will be even more difficult if he used more than one if he was to use the abilities at the same time then its my first time
confronting an ability which is so hard to read like this if he created an ability including about that then he is a fearful prodigy hes someone who can take down ise and others easily hes really a strong foe who researched about us that makes me panic so much rias seems to have a grasp of the situation yes we were defeated by those orbs with unique abilities on top of that you add cao caos physical ability and medusas eye and he showed a combo that surpasses terrifying isesan healing for xenoviasan is done next is isesan asia comes to me but i told her take care of kuroka first she was troubled at first but she nods her head and went to kuroka that bastard he doesnt even try to attack asia who is healing the others he knows that his victory isnt going to change giiiiiin then the sound of metal colliding echoes through out the lobby when i looked kiba was attacking cao cao with a holydemonic sword cao cao easily blocks the holydemonic sword with his holyspear you are too strong but cutting you at least once is my pride as a swordsmannice sword
kiba yuuto a talent that is close to that of seigfried to tell you the truth the only one who can fight against me without having any effect is you it doesnt have any absolute power but a holydemonic sword that could be used in any sort of different situation will be troublesome if trained but if it is you who is still growing then i can beat you easily cao cao swings his spear to the side kiba jumps to the back quickly he made the holydemonic sword disappear and made a holysword instead he instantly made dragonknight troopers and made them head towards cao cao a new balancebreaker please let me see it it will become good data cao cao who is wildly overjoyed starts to destroy the dragonknight troopers by controlling the orbs by will its like the orb of destruction sirzechssama uses the effect is different but he is controlling it similarly by moving it around and attacking his opponent kiba makes a stance as if he is protecting us im sorry pal the only strong guy left who can still move is you now cao cao makes his stance with his spear against kiba but
he shook his head and lowered his spear theres no point i understood the trait immediately putting the speed aside it cant reflect your techniques right its a good move you should increase it even more cao cao says that while making a sigh hearing that kiba had an expression of anger a knight who was wielding his sword to protect his comrades but the enemy didnt care about it is there any worse disgrace than this the shame kiba received as a knight its something i cant possibly even begin to understand i was also pissed that guy made fun of my palour knight how much were you able to take cao cao asks georg more than threequarters i would say most of it i wont be able to connect samael to the present world more than this behind georg who said that the magiccircle that is making samael appear is losing its lightso there is a time limit for making that monster appear here cao cao nods at georgs report excellent thats enough cao cao clicks his fingers once again then the black block covering ophis burst the tongue that was connected to it returns to samaels mouth
samael sinks into the magiccircle as he had fulfilled his role ooooooooooooo the ultimate dragonslayer that even took down vali easily disappears into the magic circle while making a cry of anguish the magiccircle also disappears ophis who was released from it looks like she did before but that attack by samael wasnt meant to make ophis disappear then what happened inside that block ophis looks at cao cao my power was taken this is what cao cao aimed for wwhat we became shocked at the astonishing phrase but cao cao just smiled happily yeah thats right ophis we wanted to put you underneath us and use your power but having you do as we wish is very hard so we changed our mind cao cao points the tip of the holyspear to the sky we will take your power and create a new uroboros sensei then says it while puking blood i see you used samael to trim down ophiss power and give birth to it by using the power you took the new ophis cao cao nods at senseis statement thats exactly right governor we want an uroboros that does as we command truth is greatred isnt a
being that is that important to us this plan all began because we are tired of pleasing her with it and we were able to challenge and test the ideal of the herofaction about challenging the superior being of can we defeat the infinite being and obtain itsplendid for you to take down the infinite being in a way like this no governor this is different from taking it down actually we do need the symbol to gather strength in that part ophis was excellent she became a propaganda and gathered those with strength that made a force like that but using the dragongod whom we cant read what shes thinking as our puppet isnt good sounds like a human it definitely is a negative way of thinking like that of a human im very honoured with your compliment yes i am a human cao cao smiled at senseis words a new ophis creating a new ophiswith the power samael took from ophis georg looked at us who are very beaten down cao cao if it is now cant you finish vali and hyoudou issei off you are right its good to finish them off when we can both are
increasing their power in an impossible way in the future they will become more troublesome dragons than ophis but lately im thinking that it is a waste i can understand why the leaders of each faction want to look over the twoheavenly dragons only at this generation the way of their growth is too abnormal that also includes the people related to both of them they are beings that are very rare in terms of data perhaps the ones who will unleash the full power within the sacred gear is not us but rather them cao cao says that he then makes the orbs and ring behind him disappear he turns around and tries to leave he isnt in a balancebreaker form anymore actually i will stop georg where is the power of ophis taken by samael supposed to be transported i made the equation during the summoning so it will be sent to the research facility at the main headquarters cao cao i see i will be returning first then hes planing to go back vali stood up while shedding blood throughout his whole body cao caowhy arent you killing us if it is you in balancebreaker you can
terminate everyone here if you use the ability to nullify womens ability and use it on asia argento then that would have completely finished off the gremory team cao cao stops and says it i made the plan along with taking you guys down without killing you arent you satisfied with it to tell you the truth the balancebreaker of the holyspear still needs lots of tunning thats why i used this occasion to see its strong points and weak points you sure look down on us vali isnt that the same as you you also love doing things like that cao cao then points his thumb to himself hyoudou issei of sekiryuutei it doesnt matter how many years it takes rise up to the level where you can fight me in the future there are less than a dozen people who can have the ultimate sacred gear fight including you and vali no matter what age the ones heroes want to challenge in decisive battles are the maou or legendary dragons bring it no matter how much of a gap there is between us right now i will reach up to your level one day cao cao then says
it to georg georg call the groups of grim reapers hades is after the weakened ophis also the swapping transportation that was done by the guys from vali team before can you try that can you transport me and swap me with seigfreed i will leave the rest to seigfreed i only saw it once so i wont know if it will work smoothly but i will try it to be expected from the descendant of that professor georg faust who made a pact with the legendary devil mephistopheles my ancestor is so great that it puts too much pressure on me anyway roger that cao cao also about the information i gained beforegeorg passes on a paper to cao cao with a serious face cao caos eyes become sharper after seeing that i see so this is the way the oldmaou gives his gratitude for saving him no i knew it from the start well he did cooperate with us enough did something happen from their atmosphere it seems like something they didnt predict happened after their conversation georg goes off somewhere using a magiccircle cao cao then turns to us georg went outside the hotel hes preparing for
the swapping transportation between me and seigfreed swapping transportation the transportation used on fenrir to swap places with vali is georg trying to do it by himself after seeing le fay and kuroka doing it together only once cao cao then says it to us very well lets play a game vali team and gremory team soon a group of grim reapers will be coming here on hadess orders to retrieve the weakened ophis over there i will also have seigfreed from my team participate in it as well the key point of this game is whether or not all of you can get out of here safely we wont know what will happen when hades captures that ophis nowcan you get out of here while protecting ophis with your lives please challenge it i want the twoheavenly dragons to survive but i have no intention of enforcing it to the grim reapers and my comrades i think it is more suitable to fight those who overcome a crisis saying just that cao cao disappears game he sure is fucking around i couldnt keep my anger down towards cao cao who has been looking down on us part 3 there
were grim reapers in the parking lot theres quite a large number of them kiba who went to take a look came back to the hotel room where we were staying on standby that bastard hades hes seriously making a move sensei spat it out with disgustafter the fight with cao cao we the gremory team who had many injured people irina sensei vali kuroka le fay and ophis were on the upper floor of the hotel located in the artificial space the hotel was sixty stories high we moved to the middle of the hotel which is the 30th floor and covered the whole floor with many of le fays sturdy barriers in order to use it as our base if she wanted to she could have put defensive barriers on the whole area but in exchange for having a certain amount of defence a single floor was the limit we had the injured resting in a separate room on the same floor waiting for asias healing me xenovia and sensei who had been injured are now completely healed kuroka has also been healed but she is resting in another room konekochan and ravel are looking after kuroka vali
had his wounds healed but his curse wasnt able to be removed so he was enduring the intense pain in another room according to le fay she tried using dispell on his curse but samaels curse was simply too powerful as a result we learned it couldnt be removed that easily he had received the best dispell there is so all he could do now was to wait for the curse to wear off naturally meanwhile vali would endure the constant pain of the curse even vali ended up in such a horrible condition if i had received the cursei think i would have died asia was sleeping in the room next door because she seemed to be tired after continuously healing the injured even in a situation like this we still wanted her to have a chance to rest but it looks like we need to make a plan so we can get out of here according to sensei this dimension was created by georg who possesses the sacred gear dimension lost dimension losts balancebreaker dimension create could use the mist to create a barrier when asia was kidnapped by diodora he made a similar thing including this hotel
he also created the parking lot and the nearby scenery as well i heard that the space he recreated in the town of kyoto where it included the surroundings of arashima and having the nijoujou at the centre was also because of that balancebreaker of course he stole the devils technology for the game fields for the rating game and used it to create it its amazing how it could recreate the interior of the hotel with so much detail the sensation of the bed felt real but electric powered objects such as televisions didnt work the water also didnt come out of the tap and the fridge was also empty so there were things he could recreate and thingshe couldnt apart from the members resting and those taking care of them everyone else is gathered in this room le fay sighed an official notification came from the main headquarters to explain it simply it said the vali team tried to do a coup dtat by deceiving ophis and making the organization their own ophis was rescued safely by herofaction terminate any remaining members of the vali team when found thats how it is were shocked at le fays report
are you serious so they were told that vali deceived ophis and she was rescued safely no no the real one is here perhaps the one that was absorbed by samael is the real one to them and the one here was either the useless or fake one they really are terrible so it turned out like that the vali team is not only being targeted by the herofaction but things turned out like this because they were trying to grant ophiss wish what hardship sensei also sighed so the valiteam is being treated as traitors and is now being targeted maybe the price of doing what they felt like finally came to them though i couldnt forgive the things the herofaction was doing le fay then said it with a downcast attitude we checked on the mysteries of the world beginning from great redsan looking for legendary strong people and sometimes make ophissamas wish come true but it seems like the herofaction found us a nuisance because we have powers also seigfriedsama seems to hate us a lot especially he didnt find it amusing that his former rival my brother arthur came to this group so there were quarrels
like that so arthur was originally from the herofaction i see wait the valiteam was doing things like that while gathering powers what are the mysteries of the world i also cant understand what youre doing about the legendary strong people i ask le fay what is that guy vali doing with his comradesyes we started off with the secret about great redsan swimming in the dimensional gap the extinct civilisation the technology of the lost continent of mu and the continent of atlantis we also searched on parallel universes we also went to look at the yggdrasill from norse mythology also the anecdote of legendary strong people and the search for the heroes or creatures whose status either dead or alive is currently unknown sometimes we do terrorism you guys are like adventurers yes we have great adventures every day we also fought against strong people then valisama is also trying to find where the beings referred to as dragons originally came from also hes looking into the reason behind the big fight of the twoheavenly dragons also if we can find a new longinus that is also one of the things we searched for le fay say it
with enjoyment i take back my words they arent adventurers they are just guys who have nothing to do maybe fighting greatred is valis final aim but apart from that they are just going around looking for things that interest them is he being an adventurer in order to seek out strong foes i think valisamas purists on things is an influence from governorsama le fay added that at the end hearing that sensei sighed and put on lazy eyes his face looked like that of a father who heard a report on the actions of his naughty son le fay smiles by the way governorsama it has been a longinus parade lately hasnt it is the person who is in possession of canis lykaon that is staying with the grigori doing alright sensei who was just asked a question looked up at the ceiling canis lykaon slash dog huh he is out on a different mission that is also quite a troublesome case he hated vali yes i have heard le fay chuckles i had my feelings soften up after seeing her adorable smile i then ask sensei by the way sensei if cao cao has the strongest longinus
then someone has the second strongest longinus rightyeah zenith tempest that is the second strongest longinus the toptier longinus are the four known as the true longinus zenith tempest annihilation maker and dimension lost the possessor of zenith tempest is already known and the heavens are mainly governing it so irina how is hehow is the bravesaintss joker doing irina who was asked a question twitched her neck do you mean duliosama i hear that he wanders around places searching for delicious food sensei seemed to be speechless from that answer wha hes a genius reincarnated angel who might be picked as a candidate for seraph hes a jokertrump card what are michael and the seraph guys doing hearing senseis question irina mumbles eeven if you say that to me sensei has also hinted about the joker of reincarnated angels before looks like he was chosen as that position is that person also strong i asked sensei but the one who answered is le fay he is someone who vali lists at the top of his wanting to fight list he is apparently the churchs strongest exorcist churchs strongest exorcist so he must possess quite a lot of strength he
is the possessor of the second strongest longinus hes the strongest exorcist hes a reincarnated angel and hes a joker hes someone who has so much strongest criteria in him xenovia who is a former exorcist responds dulio gesualdo he was also famous within the church i never met him but he was sent out mainly against highclass devils and really evil creatures even though he was just a human he fought highclass devils even though he was a human hes basically like cao cao he must be able to do that because he is a longinus possessor sensei then sighs longinus possessors huh there are 13 longinus true longinus sephiroth graal boosted gear divine dividing regulus nemeainnovate clear absolute demise dimension lost zennith tempest incinerate anthem annihilation maker canis lykaon and telos karma put that on your memo carefully ise yyes though i dont have anything to write on 13 types i have encountered about half of them just thinking that there was another half of those sacred gears with abnormal abilities gave me the chills sensei got up all of a sudden as if he realised something oh did you come up with a good plan on how
to get out of here ah i found the similar points between the current longinus possesors each and every one of them is hard to predict we have an oppaibrain and battle freak and they are all selfish guys who have weird motives im going to write that down afterwards damn it im an idiot for believing in you but sensei continued on i also found one more similar point the way they use their longinus isnt the same as how it was until now most of the possessors are finding different ways to use it and it is increasing their strength have the current kids surpassed our expectations no but still aaaah he started to think by himself again once he goes off into his own world sensei doesnt come back that easily thats what i thought but he seemed to have finished his thinking time thats because ophis returned to this room i ll go around this floor ophis just said that and left before she finally came back so how do you feel ophis i ve become weak right now i am twice as strong as the twoheavenly dragons at their strongest times that isyeah you have
weakened no no shes still twice as strong as ddraig and albion before they were sealed right and she became weak while still having that much power how strong was she beforei reply back to sensei saying she has weakened if she weakened with that then theres no place for me as one of the twoheavenlydragons well she is the strongest being out of every faction yeah you are right so the original ophis was much stronger well she didnt even have cao cao in her mind even when he was her opponent hey ophis theres something i want to ask why did you save asia and irina back then the fireball georg released against asia and irina immediately after we arrived in the lobby ophis acted as their wall and protected them why did ophis save those two i was wondering about that wasnt she uninterested in anyone besides greatred and ddraig ophis answers with one sentence they gave me tea they played cards with me is she talking about what happened at my house i asked her with a dumb look tthats it ophis nods at my question maybe she isnt a bad guy thank you very much
ophissan irina thanked her hearing ophiss condition sensei put his hand on his chin but only twice as strong as the twoheavenly dragons thats weird cao cao said that you were basically a left over but if you still posses that much power then thats enough well it was certainly like sensei said it seemed like the grim reapers and seigfried were here but if ophis had that much power left then that made me feel relived ophis raised her hand emotionlessly samael took my power i released my power in the form of snakes in another space that is what i just went to retrieve so im only twice as strong as twoheavenly dragons everyone became shocked at ophiss confession sensei shoutsso the reason you said you would go around this floor is so you could retrieve the power you released to another space ophis nods seeing that sensei starts to laugh kukuku that cao cao he said he took most of ophiss power but ophis released her power in a different dimension while she was having her power taken she retrieved most of it just now and got back some of her original power and shes still twice
as strong as the twoheavenly dragons in their primes looks like the herofaction took ophis too lightly looking back at sensei ophis created a black snake with the tip of her finger my power changed like this this is what i sent to another space that is what i retrieved but i can not leave here here there is something restraining me so thats how it is sensei stopped laughing and took a breath well if the grim reapers are here then they have predicted certain types of resistance from ophis also the current ophis isnt infinite she is finite they must have a way to seal ophis besides using samael its obvious for us to be still and careful sensei then asks le fay le fay you are talented in using magic related to space like kuroka right is there anyway to get help from the outside world or is there anyway to get at least a few members out of here there is but since kurokasan is down there is a limit to it if it is by myself there is a magic where others can leave this space with me but the number of people that can
is 2 at most since we performed a swapping transportation with valisama and fenrirchan i think the barrier on this space became even stronger i am pretty sure that it is impossible to perform the swapping transportation once again i think georgsama knows the majority of the formula used by our magic so there is only one more chance where i can use a very special transportation from here we can escape but only three people including le fay and there is only one chance are we going to make ophis escape while fighting the grim reapersi ask sensei sensei shook his head to the sides that would be impossible judging from what ophis said earlier this space has a special barrier that holds ophis captured in here i would love to ask them how they made such a thing but ophis must be the only one who cant leave here we need to destroy the barrier somehow and escape from here together and grim reapers are more dangerous than you think in terms of potential you guys are stronger but it is bad if you get cut with their scythe grim reapers trim down life spans along with giving
you damage if ise who is currently healing his lifespan gets hit by it you will end up dying because your life span will go down to zero ophis is also definite right now if she gets cut by the scythe repeatedly she will get weaker so we need to protect ophis at all cost if we have her powers get taken away any further than this the problems will increase drastically especially if our opponent is hades so it means we have to make sure we dont let the enemy take ophis i also need to be careful about grim reapers scythe i will seriously die if i get cut by it looks like today is a day where i could get killed by even the slightest of things this is weird i already had my hands full with the midclass promotion test and now it all turned around into a situation where our lives are in danger sensei then continues but we also have to choose the members who should leave here to get help from the outside world senseis gaze grasped hold of irina irina you will go first go and tell the truth about the hero
faction and coup dtat of hades to sirzechs and the heavens bbut i think it should be ravelsan to escape first sensei continued speaking without pausing for irina who is trying to argue back ravel said before that we dont need to have her as our first priority if we are to escape we are at a disadvantage here they will definitely come to take down ise vali and ophis the dragongod and twoheavenlydragons are things theyd want to take down definitely if we have hades use this ophis over here for evil deeds we wont know what would happen to this worldirina seemed like she wanted to talk back to sensei but she kept it down and nodded her head this girl takes deep care of her comrades so she must have wanted to fight along side us till the last moment but she understood her position and her role sensei then looks at xenovia take xenovia as your guard the function of exdurandal was destroyed but durandal itself can be used there is a chance that reinforcements from the herofaction or grim reapers are outside this space a guard huh xenovia narrowed her eyes just like sensei said
exdurandal was destroyed the excalibur parts that were turned into a sheath were destroyed leaving the six cores of the original holysword there is also a minor scratch on the blade of durandal caocaos ability was something that could destroy the legendary holysword with ease in this situation xenovia cant fight with her usual powers xenovia also understands that even so she still had a frustrated face guarding someone is also a splendid mission also its about time that the results of that research will be made go and confirm that as well also repairing durandal im sending you there because of that as well it doesnt seem like it will end with only this battle so go and repair it quickly having sensei say that xenovia nods quietly like this xenovia and irina will be leaving from here with le fay so they can alert others of the crisis le fay goes to another room so she could alter the formula of the transportation magic circle since she wants to insert the basic information of xenovia and irina into the formula they also left the room with her before leaving this room le fay gave irina a single sword
tthis is le fay smiles at irina who gets shocked that is the last excalibur sword which was in possession of arthur pendragon its something called excalibur rulerplease take this it is something that my brother asked me to take with me i couldnt find the right time to give it to you but i think now is a good time that sword is something that has no use to us anymore is it okay le fay nods at xenovias words we have obtained fenrirchan fenrirchans power has decreased dramatically to allow us to control him but even so there arent any creatures that are more powerful than him how about you use all of the excaliburs to repair durandal irina bows her head down tthank you very much le faysan i thought people who carry the blood of heroes are scary but there are nice people among them indeed fufufu i am honoured though i am called a weirdo along with my brother le fay made a bitter smile like that and goes to another room along with xenovia and irina but exdurandal that will have all of the excalibur in it until now it was only equipped with
6 of them even i cant imagine how it will turn up sensei then knocks his knees now rias we will think about the plan to escape from here our aim is to escape from here along with ophis and having all of us get out of here alive yes that would be obvious the two tacticians smiled and it became strategy time yes we will definitely escape from here with all of us still alive part 4 while rias sensei and akenosan make a plan in the room i was in before im on my way to kurokas room to see how she is doing her wounds have healed but shes still resting on the bed according to le fay kuroka was on the lookout to make sure nobody would be after ophis so she has been on alert this whole time because of that her stamina and mind were drained much more than she thought thats why she hasnt fully recovered even though her wounds were healed right now ravel islooking after kuroka naturally it should be ravel who is a guest that should be escaping from here first but she chose to stay here because she was
worried about konekochan and kuroka im also a member of the immortal house of phoenix i wont die that easily thats how she responded thats why it ended up being xenovia and irina escaping from here as expected from someone from the immortal family she sure has guts thats also why we need to protect this girl along with everyone else how is it i asked kuroka who is laying down on the bed kuroka put on a naughty smile ara sekiryuuteichin you are so kind to come and see me nyan well you did save my comrade konekochan after all it was just a coincidence nyan that coincidence was an action taken before you shouted your sisters name out she saved konekochan from danger by risking her life next to the bed konekochan is sitting on a chair looking down why konekochan mumbled and then suddenly got up and shouted why did you save me i was supposed to be like a tool to you right neesama i wonder i dont quite understand nyan please dont play with me that time you left me behind do you know how many horrible things the people around me said to me
even during the party in the underworld you tried to take me away by force konekochan who usually didnt speak that much was releasing all the things she had built up inside her i cant understand you neesama saying that konekochan leaves the roomkonekochan i tried to go after her but kuroka stops me by pulling my sleeve rest assured i will go after her just saying that ravel went after konekochan i have been making ravel take care of many things but i think there are things only she can do because they are in the same class i sat down on the chair where konekochan had been sitting before and then asked kuroka hey kuroka what happened at your previous masters place nothing i just killed him because he was a detestable bastard nyan saying that kuroka stopped smiling and put on a serious face nekoshou he became a nuisance because he took too much interest in our powers putting me aside if my previous stupid master were to have asked shirone to use sennjutsu she would have used it without hesitation and her powers would have gone berserk she is an honest girl after all kuroka who
just said that has some kindness in her eyes right now anyway he was focused on increasing the ability of his servants and made us go through things forcefully having his servants go through that is one thing but he also tried to forcefully strengthen his servantss family nyan the reason why kuroka became a wanted person thats because she killed her master why did she do that thats because did you save konekochan from him the reason why you tried to take her away at the underworld forcefully is so she could get away from power its because im a sekiryuutei who attracts powers she has evil intentions she has the heart of a naughty child i can tell she is someone who does the things she feels like doing but i started to think that that isnt the only side of her after spending time with her for the past several days i like fooling around you know i also like using my powers i also love entertaining things i am a stray cat after all nyan its better to wander around how i feel like with comrades who i can relate to butshirone is different she suits
being a house cat that is why sekiryuuteichan kuroka says it to me with serious eyes i dont care even if you become a mass of powers but i want you to become an idiotically honest heavenlydragon just like vali if that happens that girl will also become idiotically happy i see it cant be helped that you are a naughty cat the bad cat of the vali team there are parts of you that like being drunk with your own sennjutsu power and you probably also love fighting too but your little sister you also like konekochan like before as well right you are more clumsy than me when i said that with a bitter smile kuroka made a weird face and looked to the side i dont want to hear that from a power idiot like you nyan even if i look like this i am a wizardtype that consumed 2 bishop pieces you know well this discussion is over im going to sleep nyan or do you want to do baby making with me right now nyan you are a horrible heavenlydragon who wants to forcefully try to make love to a woman who is injured nya
i would love to no thats not what i mean idiot get some rest now is not the time for it i will have her rest until the battle starts kurokas ability will become very useful for the upcoming battle i got up from the chair and tried to leave the room thank you sekiryuuteichan i turned around after she said that but she is acting as if she didnt say anything and is sleeping after checking kuroka out i was walking towards the room where that guy was resting when i got inside the room vali had his upper body up and was laying down his wounds are healed thanks to asia but his face looks awfully bad he is breathing violently and he seems to be enduring great pain the curse of samael must be circulating throughout his bodyit is my first time seeing him like this and i dont want to see him like this either i never thought you would take that much damage from one attack when i said that he makes a bitter smile seems like i showed something unpleasant i came here to take down cao cao but i ended up like this
it means that thats how insane the dragoneater samaels curse is i didnt think you would go down without doing anything there seriously wasnt anything we could do getting hit once made this guy who is basically an embodiment of power go down that scene is burnt into my memory there must be a reason why cao cao used samael in that situation that must have been the only way he had to stop vali who was about to use juggernautdrive sounds like you are backing me up i come to realise how strong you are every time i get stronger im frustrated because it seems like i still havent caught up to you yet im really looking forward to it catch up to me quickly you sure are full of yourself which makes me feel sick of it so did you obtain the power that surpasses juggernautdrive so what if i did i feel relieved it doesnt seem like you to not do anything against cao cao right vali nodded quietly saying you are right against my sarcasm cao cao guarded georg and samael he stole the power of ophis without doing any flashy attacks he did all that
by himself and attacked us in a way that wouldnt kill us he fulfilled these four hard requirements while overwhelming us with the minimum amount of attacks necessary even if samaels power was involved you should also have realised his power that is the leader of guys who have their fangs raised against superiorbeings and who are just humansyeah i know he blocked the demonicattacks of the magic duos from both the gremory group and vali team while playing around with you and sensei even i i thought that i paid him back with triaina at kyoto but im so frustrated to find out that im not anywhere near that guy today i held my hand very tightly with frustration vali then says it they observe their opponents very carefully and research the weakness of their opponents without any blind spots on top of that they look very deeply into the traits of their weapons that is the herofaction the one in the center of them is the man called cao cao who wields the holyspear remember that mans balancebreaker very carefully that is a subspecies balancebreaker that he developed through research and he still continues to do further research
on it so he can take on the superiorbeings all by himself and there is a thing called truth idea right how strong is that guy truth idea is something very similar to our juggernautdrive you could also say that it is the most far away from it as well he can gain an overwhelming power though it will come with the price of going berserk i dont think he can control truth idea because he doesnt have that much demonicpowerno magic power as me he did try to use it against me at kyoto did he try to activate it because he was taken down by me and also because of the atmosphere of that scene or did he have a method to control it vali continues on if it is defence both you and i have higher defence than him his magicalpower isnt high either if our attacks hit cao cao he will go down but his techniques are too high but he also realises that he is a human more than anyone else in rating games he would be someone called the ultimate technique type well if he wanted to he could have enormous amounts of aura
emit from the spear to eliminate a section of an area the ultimate technique type a technique and ability that specialises in attacking peoples weakness an attack used after researching his opponents my triainarook damaged him in kyoto i could have defeated him if it hit him directly it was the same today as well but cao cao understands my ability completely and it didnt seem like it would hit him atall cao cao is the exact opposite of sairaorgsan he is too creepy and it is hard to tell what he is thinking an existence whom i cant come to understand that is cao cao oh yeah there is one thing i need to confirm hey vali why did you send ophis to our place werent you only trying to use her me to ophis vali makes a reaction as if my guess was completely off the mark is he telling the truth he used ophis as bait to lure cao cao out but he did think about ophiss wishes as well he also tried to release ophis from samaels attack if he was only after cao cao he could have left ophis like that and attacked cao cao
right away i was just someone who ophis could talk to she seemed lonely at times no its nothing i said something unnecessary forget it i see so its nothing huh okay then lets make it that way but i think i can understand what he means by ophis seeming lonely she interacted with asia and irina and saved them they who had paid attention to her that alone makes ophis someone who i would guard with my life that was something very certain to me ophis is the boss of bad guys no she was their boss even so i will make sure she escapes from here yeah you can tell that something insane would happen if she gets caught by hades after this im going to participate in the plan to escape from here vali are you going to rest i would want to rest but im a hakuryuukou so i cant help it even if my body is affected with a curse i cant be backing down from mere grim reapers there was never a choice of just staying out of it from the beginning for me an embodiment of pride i felt very relieved to hear
something that he would usually say yeah with this we can fight our preparations are readyvali lets finish our fight one day defeating you is one of my aims yeah im looking forward to it hyoudou issei both of us cant die in a place like this the plan to escape from here is getting closerlife 4 as a heavenlydragon part 1 i looked out the window of one of the hotel rooms there were creepy guys wearing black robes looking up at us i couldnt see their faces because they had hoods covering them only their eyes were glittering killing intent hostility and one more thing each one had a big scythe in their hands with very bad taste of accessories on it they had things such as skulls and monster hands on them just one glance at their scythes tells you that they were bad guys grim reapers the guys who hades the god of skeletons was walking around with and those are the guys who are trying to attack us to aid the herofaction in this artificial space no matter how i thought about it hades acted beyond his authority for what reason did he send his
forces here well there was no point for me to question political issues right now we need to find a way to leave this artificial field apparently there are only three ways to escape from this artificial space created by georg sensei gave us the explanation the three ways are the following the first way is for the caster in this case georg to unseal the dimension himself this is from the battle at kyoto the second way is to enter and exit forcefully this is what le fay the first sun wukong and yulong pulled through like i explained before this is impossible unless you are an exceptionally experienced caster right now le fay can only do this once more while taking a limited number of people with her it will be impossible to enter or exit the space a third time using le fays technique georg must have made the barrier even stronger now the members who can be dispatched for an instant battle are also limited just like the explanation before this plan will be used and the ones who are leaving in order to get support are irina and xenovia who will be guarding her and
the third way to leave here is the last one is simple and clear we either defeat the caster or destroy the central point supporting this barrier ise destroyed the barrier device when asia was captured so like that we will destroy the device that is acting as the central point for the barrierit was simple and easy to understand so that meant that this dimension would collapse if we destroyed the key point of the barrier and the problem now was to locate where that keypoint was when asia was captured before the device that was attached to her was the keypoint itself the moment i destroyed that device it seems like the barrier on that field was unsealed it seemed like kuroka was using sennjutsu and le fay was using her magic to locate the device they put a piece of paper down on the floor of the room along with a map of the hotel they put a few blocksit has the shape of human or animal and a crane by bending paper on it and they were apparently going to make an eye outside here they started to write devil letters on the map and made
mysterious chants they also spread mysterious ashes to complete the spell i couldnt understand what they were doing even if i watched them rias and akenosan were watching them with interest le fay who was closing her eyes moved her hands towards the map the crane started to shake and move the devil letters started to glow and the ashes started to move on their own making a symbol i had never seen before le fay then said there is one in the parking lot another one on the roof and another one on the second floor of the hotel in the hall room in total i have confirmed three barrier devices and they have the shape of a snakeno a statue of uroboros that is biting its tail with its mouth sensei received a piece of paper from le fay who drew a picture of the statue on it a statue of a snake bitting its tail it had a circular shape sensei then said so the barrier devices we have to destroy are the statues of uroboros and there are three of them looks like this will be a hard job this artificial space is specially created to
have ophis remain here this would have been nothing to the normal ophis georg must have created this barrier space already knowing that ophis would have had her power reduced as a part of their plan now le fay whats happening with the devices did the number of grim reapers increase from before yes governor there are grim reapers gathered at the locations of all the devices more like they are spread out everywhere except on this floor they are even present in the corridor it seems like most of them aregathered in the parking lot cao caosama has already left this place but siegfriedsama is here instead georgsama is also in the parking lot rias then said to sensei azazel lets do it how we planned it before sensei nodded at riass words yeah geez you sure did think of an astonishing plan ise the woman you have fallen for understands you more than anyone else you know sensei said it with a bitter smile rias also seemed very confident in it huh were they trying to make me do something i thought that we were going to split up into two groups one going up and one going
down then destroy the devices and rejoin to have the last battle i was in doubt but akenosan then whispered into my ears the truth is yes yes riass plan is being whispered through my ears whwhat she sure did think of an amazing plan those were the words that came out of my mouth thats because it was amazing its amazing how she came up with such an idea that uses my potential like that in this sudden situation even i never thought about that bbut it seems like i can pull it off i can probably do it kaaaa the woman i fell for sure is amazing i look at rias with admiration sensei then rests his hand on my shoulder well it certainly is amazing but this is a plan rias came up with because she is crazy about you a completely different strategy from sona even so it is still amazing to be expected from rias gremory the number 1 candidate for the person i want as my bride now gather here everyonerias made everyone gather in the center of the room everyone directed their attention towards rias rias then said with a smile that was
full of confidence now my adorable servants lets get out of this place immediately i will explain the plan now like this the plan to escape from artificial space began inside the hotel on the floor that is being covered by le fays barrier i am standing in the corridor within the barrier next to me is konekochan who is in nekomata mode she is doing a seiza6 with her eyes closed le fay irina and xenovia are in a room close to us they are preparing the magiccircle that will be used for escaping the door is open and the other guys are gathered in the same room but close to the window kuroka whose stamina is still low and vali who still cant have his curse removed are in the room as well everyone left the room where we discussed our plan and are now looking out the window at the parking lot the barrier surrounding this floor also wont last much longer the grim reapers have begun to destroy the barrier located on the emergency staircase it seems the same thing is happening to the windows of every room behind the closed curtain where everyone is gathered
the grim reapers are using their scythes energetically so it means that this wont go anywhere unless we make our move first i went into balancebreak immediately and wore the armor now the plan will commence upon the completion of le fays magiccircle konekochan who had her eyes closed to find a certain thing stands up she points at certain places on the ceiling and floor senpai there and over there roger that i nod seeing that konekochan tries to enter the other room i pulled konekochans hand konekochan rushed out of kurokas room earlier it seems like she had a quarrel with ravel who went after her and she came back a bit refreshed because of it at times like this im very grateful of ravels existence it is important to have comrades who you can casually have arguments with but i also need to say this to konekochankonekochan i also think kuroka is a bad person i can understand that she sought power and is attracted to the power of sennjutsu there is no way she can be good since she put herself in a terrorist group but i looked in the direction where kuroka is it seems
like she hasnt noticed us but i do think she is konekochans sister after all she is a stray cat and she is a bad woman who likes to do naughty things but she is your family i went through painful experiences because of neesama no matter what the reason is the world of devils is strict towards those who have become an exiled devil by killing their master that also applies to their family konekochan received the crime of her sister who became exiled and she was about to have her heart shattered it must have been painful i bear a grudge towards neesama i hate her but she saved me earlier konekochan says it to me with strong eyes im thinking of trusting her for now at least until we leave here i got shocked at the unexpected words coming out of konekochans mouth oh my looks there was no point for me to cheer her up this girl has become stronger she is looking ahead where she can answer by herself now that is enough if kuroka does anything weird to you again then tell me i will make her pay for it after saying that i
pat konekochans head konekochan then hugs me i became stronger thanks to senpai gyakun got stronger thanks to senpai that is why i am thinking about getting stronger you can even i got stronger konekochan will get stronger in notime i love you senpai even with buchou ahead of me even if asiasenpai and akenosenpai are ahead of me i will definitely catch up to them thats why konekochan looks directly up at meplease make me your bride when i get bigger eh you propose to him here before i could get shocked by her words rias asia akenosan xenovia irina and ravel are horrified oiiiiiiiii you guys were listening to us while you acted as if you werent wait a bride bride you say i never expected to be proposed to by konekochan at all but i understood the feelings this girl has towards me when she comforted me before the match against bael theres no way that i will be troubled by this manliness this is the part where i have to show my manliness if you have both your oppai and height grow biggeri will be happy after speaking out with all i have that was the
only thing that came out of my mouth uwaaaaaaaah how can this be konekochan said something very important right now and yet i couldnt say anything proper having her oppai and height grow bigger that is just sexual harassment i regret it a lot within myself but konekochan nods her head strongly i understand i will drink lots of milk please wait for me senpai to become senpais bride i will get breasts that wont even lose to neesamas breasts it seems like she is okay with it and konekochan is high spirited tthis is okay hhmmm i wonder if i was able to show my manliness i totally cant tell the formula is completed while we were doing this le fay announces the completion of the magiccircle under le fay irina and xenovias feet the circular light was formed and the magiccircle was glowing they were not devils letters but a magiccircle made from a magicians letters with this the three of them could leave even if they escape from here the pursuit squads of the herofaction will be after them but since le fay will be with them they should be able to escape konekochan also moved close
to the window and finally the plan began i look at rias she looks back at me and nods the signal for the start of our plan i change the evilpiece within me and promote the one i am going to promote to will be the triainas bishop promotion to welsh blaster bishopchange fang blast red aura gathers on my back and it starts to shape itself into a backpack to create cannons a cannon on both of my shoulders i aim one cannon up and one cannon down just like how rias told me to earlier konekochan used sennjutsu to locate the grim reapers on the roof and on the second floor so i know their whereabouts i then shout towards my comrades here i go our plan that is to fire a blast using both the cannons of my triainas bishop which are aimed up and down the locations where the devices are located are the roof second floor hall and parking lot destroying the devices located on the roof and second floor separately and then meeting up in the parking lot would take too much time also the enemies might see through that then we should destroy
them together as soon as the plan starts if i aim towards the locations where there are lots of grim reapers then we can take them down along with the devices lets do it ddraig what we will be aiming for are the devices of this barrier and the grim reapers around them we will take them down at once yeah duuuuuuuuu the backpack quietly makes a noise and enormous amounts of aura gather at the cannon the right cannon is aimed at the ceiling the left cannon is aimed at the floor i dont need to expand the area of the blast it is enough if it has high penetration that can break through one point at once goooooooo dragon blaaaaaaaaaaaster zuoooooooooon there are enormous amounts of aura blasting out from both cannons both up and downwards the aura blast aimed towards the roof and the hall the dragonblaster violently shakes the whole building i finished shooting out the aura so i look up and downthere are huge holes in the ceiling and in the floor le fay who has her eyes closed informs us the barrier devices located on the roof and hall are destroyed the grim reapers
around them as well with this the only device left is the one in the parking lot preparation for transportation is complete as well then the light emitted from the magiccircle increases and the light envelops le fay irina and xenovia xenovia irina i will leave it to you guys i say it to the both of them who are disappearing into the transportation light ise dont die we will definitely report this to the heavens and maousama saying that both of them disappeared from this artificial space their escape is a success alright whats left is for us to beat those guys up and destroy the final device lets go guys sensei swings his spear of light to the side and destroys the big window yes everyone responds to him the vanguards of sensei rias akenosan and kiba exit through the broken window by spreading their wings what is ahead of them isthe parking lot filled with grim reapers the grim reapers who fly up in the sky while holding onto their scythe it really is creepy to see guys wearing robes and wielding scythes flying in the sky my comrades began to clash against the enemies in mid
air georg who created this artificial space must have realized that le fay and the others left from here at the same time the barrier on this space must have gotten stronger and it has now become impossible to enter or exit from here using the same method well that will be all over once we destroy the barrier device located at the parking lot the ones who stayed behind in the room are kuroka vali and asia who are the rearguards and konekochan and ravel who stayed behind to support kuroka kuroka created a sturdy defence magic circle to protectthe members staying behind by guarding the whole room with her powers it will be impossible for the current kuroka to put a barrier on the whole floor like le fay did but it seems she can protect a single room there were grim reapers that were near the room they are in they found out that it would take time to destroy the barrier so they left the hotel and flew up and headed towards sensei and the others this is also part of the plan i will heal everyones wounds asia is responsible for healing wounded allies from
here she also glowed and now she can form a bow with her aura to shoot out healing arrows the accuracy is high as well if the arrow is about to hit an enemy instead of an ally it automatically disappears her healing power could heal both allies and enemies so this factor was very important just like i thought asia is talented at things like this konekochan and ravel are supporting kuroka by holding her body ara shirone are you trying to help me im repaying the debt of when you helped me please concentrate on the defence magiccircle i will support you with sennjutsu why are you helping me ojousan nya ravel face turns red when kuroka asks her and she becomes a tsuntsun ii just felt like it you should be grateful kuroka smiles hearing that i see then i will accept your kindness shirone do you want me to teach you how to use sennjutsu along with the youjutsu of nekomata i dont mind if you dont want to kuroka says it half jokingly but konekochan nods with a serious face no please teach me i want to get stronger so i can help my comrades
i need to get stronger even if i have to rely on neesama so konekochan is moving forward as well even if that doesnt lead to reconnection with her sister it will be good if it leads her to becoming even stronger and i think ravel will also be with her from now on if gasper comes back then the firstgrade trio of our group will be assembled i am really looking forward to it also vali who is the rearguard iseven if im not in balancebreaker don he shot a huge demonicpower blast from his hand and eliminated several grim reapers who are flying in the air his demonicpower is as powerful as always even if his condition is in the worst state due to the curse vali will always be vali vali continues his attacks the grim reapers are getting destroyed so shall i ophis also supports from behind if the dragon who has the strongest power among us joins in then our plan to escape will go smoothly ka the moment ophis has her hands shine baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnng an explosion was heard loud and clear and unbelievable destruction happens in the parking lot not just the grim reapers
but it seems my comrades got mixed up in it as well from the smoke rias kiba and akenosan appear and i confirmed their safety what intense destructive power it has we will also get killed if she doesnt reduce her powers i was about to complain to her but ophis looked at her hands while twitching her neck strange holding back my power very hard wwhaaaaat did she just use her power without controlling it dangerous it really is dangerous if we have a rearguard like her we wont be able to fight safely even if she fights as a vanguard her power is so unstable that we wont know what will happen isnt the current ophis like a block of disadvantage factors sensei then flies towards our direction by flapping his wings hey ophis you dont have to fight looking at your current situation you probably cant control your power properly because of samael just watch if you use your powers here both enemies and allies will be eliminated we will make the path for our escape saying that sensei returns to the battlefield ophis nods and sits down on the spot ah she is really honest oh
i also need to join the battlefield istood at the window side and pointed my cannons towards the parking lot i can also support my allies like this i am a powertype who can also give support after all i then aim my cannons at the grim reapers in the parking lot this time i dont need to hold back i will shoot with the intent to destroy the parking lot once more dragon blaaaaaaaaaaster zuooooooooon then enormous amounts of aura shot out from my cannon and enveloped the parking lot part 2 break break the artificial space was making sounds my dragonblaster and ophiss power not only affected the buildings but they also caused major damage to the artificial space even after receiving that enormous amount of damage the barrier is still active so the device hasnt been destroyed yet it also proves that georgs ability is great because of triainas bishops blast the parking lot was completely destroyed without leaving a trace it is in a state where there isnt a single place to set foot on and the ground is cracked and in shambles there was a lot of dust in the air my comrades continued to
fight the grim reapers who managed to survive my blast after the dust settled down i was able to see the battle clearly kiba was cutting down the grim reapers with godspeed sensei eliminated a group of grim reapers with his gigantic spear of light i can only say splendid at their fights there are no flaws as they take down the enemies holylightning akenosan created an enormous amount of holylightning at the tip of her fingers and it instantly eliminated a large group of grim reapers eliminate rias also created many extremely large blocks of power of destruction and they eliminated a very large group of grim reapers along with thesurrounding scenery seeing that i acknowledged them once again our oneesamas power can be used to its fullest in a group battle like this both holylightning and the powerofdestruction are attacks that can cause lots of effects throughout the field if our opponents are strong foes who concentrate on area attacks then they are able to perform a splendid battle also our members are dodging the scythes magnificently well our lifespan would be reduced if we got hit by them after all so our battle wont go smoothly unless
we concentrate on dodging the scythes even lowlevel grim reapers are stronger than average midclass devils ddraig says i see so it means most of our members can defeat guys like that with ease and they can even eliminate a group of them all at once rias and akenosan came over after noticing me ise please increase my power with gift i will eliminate them all at once same for me as well please do roger that i affirmed and put my hands on their shoulders once i raised the dragon power within me my gift is able to transfer to both people at once boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost transfer my power was getting transferred to both of them rias and akenosans power increased with this they have powered up drastically rias and akenosan flew up and release a gigantic shots of power of destruction and holylightning towards the grim reapers the swirl of power of destruction and holylightning that filled most of the space in this artificial space expanded throughout the area while glowing uha thats unbelievable if you get hit by this thing you wont survive even if
you are a very strong foe it looks like they can take down all of the grim reapers by themselveswell most of the grim reapers did perish with your blasts and ophiss attack but those two also have high stats and their powers can rise this much from receiving the power of sekiryuutei well dragonblaster is the best way to take down grunts and i shot them twice and transferred my power to both of them so my stamina has been reduced quite a bit especially my aura has gone down drastically i went through all that so i need the grim reapers to be eliminated already ya it has been awhile sekiryuutei there is someone in front of me who is speaking at me a gentlelooking guy with white hair who is carrying several demonicswords with him aah its that guy i met at kyoto yo mr hero your name was siegfried right are you my opponent when i said that he shrugged his shoulders that would be fun the current you would be able to put up a good fight against me but i will have you fight these gentlemen over here first without any sound groups of
grim reapers appeared around siegfried comparing them to the grim reapers the other guys are fighting against these guys have darker robes and scythes the killing intent they were giving me is a rank higher as well so he wants me to play around with these guys first i presume grim reapers huh its bad news if i get cut by their scythe right well anyway i will just play around without being hit then confirming that i made a battle stance against the grim reapers they came toward me wielding their scythes roughly there is a huge gap in that attack because of my training with kiba i am familiar with high speed slash attacks i dodged the scythes of the grim reapers with minimal movement and shot a dragonshot at them don the grim reaper perished with my shot yeah my dragonshot can take them down with ease the grim reapers came at me with greater numbers and i continued fighting them for a while i began taking them down with punches and countersits too easy comparing them with sairaorgsan and cao cao they sure are easy to handle watching my battle siegfried looked astonished the ones sekiryuutei
is fighting against are supposed to be midlevel grim reapers tthey are but they are at a level where i can take care of them easily it is easy to read the movement of their scythes and even if they make a suspicious movement it is easy to dodge it because they arent that fast there were those that seemed like they were doing magical attacks but i was able to reflect them with my fist just like sairaorgsan im shocked you are strong enough already with the normal balancebreaker though it didnt work at all against cao cao siegfried smiled at my comment well he is special after all you shouldnt worry about it you are a strong foe already siegfried gave me a remark like that before the battle i asked sensei for me to win against cao cao what should i do i asked sensei because he is the one who understands my powers and sacred gear the best you could say that you are currently stronger than cao cao but that is only if your attacks hit him but it seems like they wont right yeahit is the best to use a special move specialised against
him on your first battle of course that is only if you can surpass his outrageous technique level a technique that can defeat someone who even vali calls a strong foe oi oi oi i am dumb already to begin with and you are telling me to create a move like thathaaaaa why are the guys who are after me so insanely strong i was just a normal high school student until recently and now strong guys have begun to gather around me i feel like crying its like i said before right right now you are already strong enough basa the one who said that to me and came down to where i am standing was sensei if you fight against guys like sairaorg and cao cao grim reapers like these guys wont be able to compete against you even if they attack in a group well i can say the same for me as well though sensei pointed at himself confidently yeah sensei is also strong though he did get wasted by cao cao well cao cao was certainly on a different level he seemed like he had researched us thoroughly i will be troubled if you look
down on grim reapers a mysterious voice echoed throughout the parking lot sensing a disturbing presence i looked in its direction and it seemed like something is about to appear from within a distorted space the thing that appeared was something that was wearing a decorated robe a grim reaper im in doubt because he has his hood down revealing his face even if i say that he has his face uncovered he is wearing one of those masks that are worn by clowns his scythe had an even creepier aura compared to the ones wielded by the grim reapers i was previously fighting the blades of the scythe were very black as well just looking at it told me that it is a highlevel grim reaper a bossclass that is sensei is shocked to see him you are the grim reaper bowed at sensei this is my first time seeing you governordono of the fallenangels i am one of the grim reapers that serves under hadessama my name is pluto the ultimatelevel grim reaper pluto to send a grim reaper that appears even in a legend that skeletongeezer sure did something unexpected you have allied with the boss of
the terrorists ophis and tried to break the alliance between the allied factions that will result in your death for you who has been talking about alliances to do such a thing what the heck is that he said something totally off i was puzzled and sensei seems really pissed i see so you are going to make it like that huh so you are trying to eliminate us by making up a reason like that and you attacked us who were fighting against the terrorists how much have you guys been planning ahead you bunch of clowns soon there will be a time where we wont have to make up things like that but this time we did now then i am not as weak to fall behind devils and fallenangels more like you guys just came here to piss us off i presume yes you could say that even to us grim reapers devils and fallenangels are a nuisance you sure are looking down on us i am not looking down on you i am serious i will be taking ophis who became a fake now swift saying that he disappeared from my sight hes fast the moment
i thought that i heard the sound of metal colliding sensei blocked the scythe of the grim reaper with the spear of his artificial sacred gear sensei then made a stern expression i got beaten up by cao cao before and my artificial sacred gear isnt fixed completely yet but not using it will be dangerous i guess fafnir i will have you keep up with me a bit longer saying that sensei had his spear emit golden aura and he quickly equipped armour onto himself having his 12 black wings expand he went up into the air pushing the grim reaper called pluto upwardsgiiin giiiin both of them began to exchange flashy moves up in the air that grim reaper is keeping up with sensei isnt he faster than sensei he is wielding his scythe at such a high speed that hes leaving black after images of himself sensei ise dont come i will be his opponent saying that sensei continued his midair battle against pluto everytime they clashed with each other the atmosphere shook violently that proves just how strong they are now it looks like i will have to be your opponent this time it is siegfried
he already has four of his dragon arms out along with his normal arms and he is holding onto 6 demonicswords he had already entered into his balancebreaker so it looked like he is ready i think his sacred gear ability allows him to have double the power for each additional arm simply he can have up to four stages of doubling his power he will become quite strong should i go ahead using triaina or should i use a combo i can understand that he is an opponent that is hard to take on with the usual balancebreaker i made my stance thenkiba appeared coming beside me he said one thing im sorry isekun i will take him its rare to see this guy have hostility towards someone he looked directly at siegfried siegfried smirked at kibas appearance and said kiba yuuto it seems like you gained a new ability i couldnt forgive myself for my overwhelming loss against you back in kyoto so i increased my training while having the sekiryuutei as my opponent that seems interesting kiba created a new holydemonic sword in his hand and made his stance against siegfried his opponent pointed his six demonicswords
at kibageez looks like they went to a world of their own geez i did hear someone say that swordsmen get attracted to each other but it really was true yeah yeah i will just stay here and watch while i was thinking that kiba disappeared from the scene giiin i could hear the sound of metal colliding from right ahead there were sparks created in the direction siegfried moved his swords kiba moved at a high speed and siegfried blocked his attacks with minimal movements i cant see kiba anymore that guy really is getting faster and faster i dont know any other person besides him who can pull out the traits of a knight this much but in the previous battle he also showed fast moves like this but his swords couldnt reach siegfried and it was still impossible when he and xenovia fought against him together does kiba have some kind of plan i was watching the battle with worry but there were cuts appearing on siegfrieds clothes it might be a bit but does it mean kibas swordsmanship is reaching siegfrieds distance but siegfried put on a smile of confidence i see your technique and speed
are higher than before but its a fact that only the tip of your sword can reach me there was a shallow cut on siegfrieds cheek his attacks are working more than before but he still cant inflict any meaningful wounds then siegfrieds demonicswords began to glow nothung tyrfing zuooon swinging the demonicsword to the side a huge cut is created in the atmosphere and when he swung down another sword a huge crater was formed in the parking lot followed by the sound of the earth rumbling so a demonicsword that specializes in sharpness and a demonicsword that specializes in destructive power hows this for next balmung he thrusted the demonicsword that was covered with a drillshape aura towards kiba creating a dreadful whirlwind from the sword that swept down on him grinding the atmospherekiba changed his weapon into a holysword and quickly created the dragonknight troops and used half of them as a shield the dragonknights were shattered into pieces from getting pierced by the huge whirlwind the remaining half went towards siegfried ha dainsleif siegfried swung his demonicswords to the side and huge ice pillars were formed from the ground repeatedly that went towards kiba and pierced
through the dragonknights freezing them bakin while making a sound the dragonknights were shattered siegfrieds collection of demonicswords is a threat they have that much effect when he just swings like that even if kiba was able to shorten his distance his stamina wouldnt last long i was worried about things like that but the remaining dragonknights went slashing towards siegfried siegfried seemed like he found out the weakness of kibas dragonknight troops and he began to dodge them without using his demonicswords i understand the weakness of that new balancebreaker just by fighting with you for a short time you can reflect your ability to the dragonknights right but you still cant reflect your techniques to them these troops who only have speed cant possibly compete against me siegfried tried to dodge the last dragonknight but thats when it happened that dragonknight showed movements that were more complicated compared to the other dragonknights and it cut off one of siegfrieds dragon arms at the same time something happened to siegfrieds body he bent back and his expression was covered with pain siegfried looked at the dragonknight that cut off his arm the dragonknight removed the mask of his helmet
underneath it was kibas face impossible then the one over there is kiba was a bit away from the dragonknights and was giving orders to them but his appearance started to change and it eventually disappeared the other kiba wearing the armour started to take his armour off and smirkedthe one over there is my illusion its made from demonicpowers the real me wore the dragonknights armour and hid among the other dragonknights waiting for you to lower your guard oh my he did something like that i hid among them when i used them as a shield i anticipated you would find out about my dragonknights weakness and waited for you to lower your guard like i thought you did just as i expected it seems like it is the battlestyle of the herofaction to find their opponents weakness so i used that to my advantage amazing kiba you are really amazing to make your weakness into your weapon in a situation like that siegfried seems like he resents his mistake but more than that he is shocked this damagedid you gain the power of a dragonslayer im also shocked at siegfrieds words what is the meaning of this
kiba spoke while pointing the holysword to the front yes dragonslayer holysword since your sacred gear represents a dragon it cant withstand this without any exceptions it is said that those are the hardest types to create dragonslayer holyswords and demonicswords but it looks like you learned how to do it quite the talent you have are you serious so kiba can even make dragonslayer holyswords now what insane talent he has but he made such a thing while keeping it quiet from me i need to lecture him afterwards i was actually told by azazelsensei about dragonslayer swords after the battle against diodora astaroth and it was one of the ways to stop isekun if he went berserk dragonslayer holyswords and demonicswords that is of course i can make dragonslayer holydemonicswords as well so he was researching it as one of the ways to stop me well if i was to go berserk i would gladly be slain by my friends sword kiba then made a bitter smile but after that isekun quit juggernautdrive and started to search for a power that wouldnt make him go berserk so i stopped my training forachieving dragonslayer holydemonic swords but after losing
to you i tried to achieve it once again siegfried bit his teeth with regret at kibas words i never thought that gentleman would make an expression like this it must have been humiliating for him to be in this situation just to be expected from him rias came down next to me without me noticing she continued to speak ise you train with yuuto every time right eh yes that is true i think that is an amazing thing i admire yuutos potential that can keep up with you ise right now you have such strength that you are able to fight against that sairaorg who can combine with the longinus lion what do you think about yuuto who can keep up with your training every time he is already a monster since he can keep up with me without wearing anything to protect himself that is my honest opinion he basically discarded the idea of increasing his defense which was supposed to be his weakness the reason is because he is trying to master something else that being it is good as long as he doesnt get hit so in reality he continues to train while avoiding my
attacks it will be my win if i hit him but if it doesnt i wont know the outcome he is being overshadowed by your power but he is also rising to be quite the formidable fighter from my point of view you and yuuto have enough strength to become the representatives of the young devils rias smiled because of her servants who she is proud of if i remember correctly sensei mentioned something to me after the bael match in the future when we participate in the professional game the one who will be in the spotlight for the same dicefigure game will not be me but kiba thats because since i have a chess piece value of 8 it will be easier to use kiba who has a value of 3 chess pieces he is exactly right if it is a dice game then it will be easier to use kiba who costs less than me and he is also strongthe training with sekiryuutei makes me even stronger i recommend you to train with him once except you have to be prepared to lose your life when you train with him isekun doesnt hold back at all siegfried
made a sigh after kiba said that you are right i will think about it but thats if you can survive this mist appeared around him and from the mist a large number of grim reapers appeared once again that mist is georgs sacred gear did he summon the grim reapers by using the mist to connect to the world outside there is an outrageous number of grim reapers they started appearing as if to fill this whole parking lot up their numbers easily exceeded 200 or 300 you guys might have dodged them before but having this many against you youre more likely to get hit by their sycthes now siegfried made a smile of happiness quantity over quality no matter how many of them get taken down it will be okay if they get us if they start to grind away at our lifespan we will eventually fall in my case i am still currently healing so i wont know how many hits i can withstand ara ara this is a bit troublesome akenosan who was up in the air striking down holylightning comes down and joined us rias kiba akenosan and i gather closer and made our
stances now how should we break through even if i count easily the number of grim reapers exceeds 1000 the whole field the parking lot both above and below the hotel and also the sky is covered with grim reapers the one on one battle between sensei and pluto is like a totally different world so much so that noone is getting close to them if we have all those numbers come at us at once we wont be able to dodge the scythes will definitely hit us if i were able to use triainas bishop if i were able to use dragonblaster i would be able to wipe out this large amount of grim reapers but i dont have enough aura to shoot that i used all of it up with the two blasts i shot earlier it happened when i was stuck deciding on my next action there were those speaking to me within my soul hey hyoudou issei looks like you are in a pinchthats troublesome grim reapers are very troublesome these voices is it perhaps the previous senpai i closed my eyes and sent my thoughts deep within the sacred gear the white world was filled
with tables and chairs like usual but the senpais were wearing tuxedos holding onto wine looking like gentlemen and sitting on the chairs with elegance one of the senpai was shaking the wine glass with no wine inside and said this to me with a tone of a gentleman fufufu to get out of a crisis like this we can only use that correct what do you mean by that yes we can only use that that must be it the senpai started to agree with each other tthis flow you guys arent telling me to use juggernautdrive again right i was worried that they might be saying something dangerous again but the senpai shook their fingers to the side saying no no no wrong yes we have already graduated from juggernautdrive we were introduced to something even greater by youyes the power of breasts hhuh wwhat the heck are you guys saaaaaaying these idiotic senpai they were wearing clothes befitting of gentlemen so i was wondering what they were going to say and they said the power of breasts that is an outrageous thing sensei predicted and it is different from the power confirmed shit why are these senpai
putting on such bright faces even if i said that the senpai arent listening to me and create a vision in the air of the white world what appeared were familiar breastswait isnt that vision an image of riass breasts who is standing right next to me one of the senpai pointed at the breasts that appeared in the vision lets depend on those breasts yes that is the source of power for the oppaidragon who protects the future we became gentlemen who enjoy breasts after connecting with you fufufu this really doesnt feel bad eh what are these guys muttering about i dont get it senpai then put on a serious face and then said it with a serious tone the time to take switchprincess to another stage has come once again i became speechless at those words ero no something crazy is about to happen ssensei something crazy is going on i decided to ask sensei who was putting on an intense battle in midair what is it dumbass im having a hardcore battle with this grim reapearsama damn it wait this conversation its similar to the story tannin told me dont tell me its that is that
it i said it to sensei who became horrified while dodging the scythe of pluto the past senpai are telling me to make riass breasts go to the next stage sensei danced wildly after hearing that its hereeeeeeee yeeeees poke it now grope it touch it fuhahahahaha oi heroes and grim reapers our oppai couple will release the infamous power of breasts its the ending technique of the gremory group what is that why is he stirring up the enemies no it cant be why is siegfried horrifiedlisten kouhai the time to use the power of gift on those breasts has come senpai who looked strict says that power of transfer you are telling me to use gift on riass breasts yeah thats right you should have been wondering what would happen if you use gift on those breasts for a while now this time a gentle looking senpai said that gift on her breast i certainly was wondering what would happen if i use the power of transfer of sekiryuutei on riass breast will the size increase or will the beauty of it increase or will the elasticity have the ultimate bounciness those things made me wonder and i
wanted to make it clear one day you could say that it is my ultimate research theme you are telling me i can do it uum there is something i would like you to hear i thought that i should get riass approval first what is it i wont get shocked at anything you say anymore what determination its not a normal psychological condition what kind of crisis did she go through to respond and cope with things related to breasts i said it after drinking down my saliva can i transfer the power of sekiryuutei to your breasts she seemed like she became speechless for a second with my confession this situation is like a dj vu yeah it is exactly the same as the time in kyoto then if that is the case thinking for a moment rias said it with a strong voice i really dont get it i didnt get what happened in kyoto to tell you the truth i really dont get what is going on now but i understand please use the power of transfer on my breasts what a magnificent woman she is if it was a normal woman they would decline a
crazy situation like this you know and she gives an ok immediately i can only lower my head down to my master who is my oneesama and the woman i deeply love i start to cry a lot beneath my armour and gathered energy to my gauntlet yeah thats right the woman i love approved it then i have to show my manliness now lets transfer it gift it is gift lets go boosted gear transfer your power to riass breaaaaaaasts i made the part of the gauntlet covering my hand disappear i began to move around my fingers and then touched her breasts yes there is a reason behind touching riass breasts with my naked hand monyun i felt the ultimate sensation and elasticity through my hand boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost transfer iyaaaaaan rias cried at my transfer then paaaaaariass breasts started to emit a red aura bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust i heard an unfamiliar sound through the jewels so its bust now huh and her breasts began to glow in red light like usual the breasts
are glowing piiiiiiiiin a red light is shot out from riass breasts that light started to envelop me a gentle light it is similar to asias light its warm this is the same warmth as rias after receiving the warmth of the woman i love there was a change within me this is my aura is replenishing yes the aura that was wasted because of the dragonblaster i shot earlier is starting to replenish energy is coming back to my whole body amazing its like my energy is rising sensei who was witnessing this scene shouts its the third phase rias you are your breasts entered the third phase it is breastpower another solid evidence is found for the power of breasts that i have been predicting ii dont quite get it but i can do it now i can shoot dragonblaster promotion to welsh blaster bishop change fang blast i change the evilpiece within me quickly the backpack and cannon start to form i aimed my cannon towards the grim reapers take thiiiiiiiiiiiis the third dragonblaster baaaaaaaaaaaaaaangenormous amounts of aura are shot out from the cannon with no way out the grim reapers are enveloped by the blast and
perish with that shot one third of the army of grim reapers perished but i have used up the aura needed for the next blast looks like the light from the oppai before it was enough for just one shot piiiiiiiiiiin how can this be again from riass breast another redlight is shot out directed at me the red light that envelops around me once again my aura started to replenish once again bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust receiving the red aura it seems like the tension of the jewel increased siegfried shouted seeing this situation this is bad its dangerous to leave those breasts alone breasts that respond to being summoned breasts that replenish sekiryuuteis power we wont know what will happen next the one who is the most dangerous isnt the twoheavenly dragons or ophis it might be rias gremorys breasts sekiryuutei and rias gremory when these two are together it creates miracles time after time and the things that are the key for that arethose breasts you dont have to say that out loud with a serious face see even rias is embarrassed sensei who was

of breasts was charging up repetition of destruction and restoration the wheel of destiny that was continuing to spinbust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust bust baaaaaaaaaaang this field started to collapse after receiving a release of our love from the dragonblaster stop theeeeeeeeem stop sekiryuutei and switchprincess at this rate we will actually be wiped out by the power of breasts siegfried desperately gave orders to the grim reapers but you guys protect the bakauple with full strength they are our pivot sensei also gave orders to the gremory group i wont have you get in the way of those two they are getting heated up so dont you think its bad to intrude on them ufufu im so jealous rias maybe i might get spoiled by isekun afterwards my passion to have an affair gets heated up the more they get heated up kiba and akenosan are also protecting us our blast of love even continued after this the field that doesnt even have a weed left yes the power of love between me and rias finally wiped out the grim reapers and the only ones left are siegfried georg
and pluto but the sacrifice was too big riass breasts are already flat as a result of sending the power of breasts to me her oppai began to grow smaller and now there isnt anything left even if she says that they will return to normal if she rests seeing her state makes me sad and it is hard to endure like this they are no different from konekochans now i started to cry a lot when i compared rias and konekochans breasts hitkonekochan threw something to my head from the 30th floor of the hotel i didnt say anything but she might have guessed by looking at my eyes sensei who made his distance with pluto landed besides me pluto also landed on their side now siegfried georg and pluto this is checkmate sensei pointed the spear of light at them you have insane power like always sekiryuutei siegfried said that while breathing hard the device in the parking lot was still active georg created a barrier that is small but very powerful and i couldnt even take it down with the continuous shots of dragonblaster but georg was also breathing violently because he had been putting all his
power into defending the barrier covering the device also began to shake even if he is the possessor of a hightier longinus there are limits we can corner them in a bit now even siegfried has a hard expression then it happened sparkle sparkle a noise echoed through this dimension i heard this sound before its the sound we heard when a hole is created in a dimension when i looked up a hole was created in the sky we thought it was the appearance of new enemies but siegfried and others also had expressions of doubt so it means its an unexpected intruder the one who intruded by making a hole in the dimension is a man with lightarmour and cape i was familiar with him yes i only saw him once but i remember him that guy landed between us and siegfried it has been awhile sekiryuutei and vali he glared at me and then glared at vali who was on the 30th floor of the hotel sensei then narrowed his eyes shalbabeelzebub the leader of the oldmaou faction yes this guy is the descendant of oldmaou who appeared before us in the incident with diodora the mastermind
who was controlling diodorafrom the shadows but wasnt he killed by me when i went into juggernautdrive siegfried took a step forward shalba i did receive a report but i never thought you were acting by yourself hey siegfried i certainly did get lots of assistance from you people you have my gratitude thanks to that my wounds have healed though i did lose ophiss snake and my powers are lower than before and the reason for you to come here is nothing much i thought i would declare war on you shalba said it out loud with confidence what was he thinking shalba put on an evil smile and then revealed what was under his cape underneath a boy appeared looking at him his eyes had shadows in them and it seemed like he was being controlled ah it is the boy who created antimonsters using the longinus annihilation maker in kyoto he was supposed to be in the herofaction but why is he with shalba who belongs to the oldmaou faction seeing the boy siegfried and georg got shocked leonardo shalba why did you bring that boy here no why is he with you leonardo was supposed to
be on a different mission did you bring him here shalba said to the two who were shocked i thought i would have him assist me for a bit just like this buuuun shalba activated an ominous small magiccircle within his hand and put that closer to the boy called leonardo then the devil letters within the magiccircle moved fast then the boy screamed uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaascreaming out loud he also had a painful expression at the same time his shadow expanded so much that it covered the whole field what was shalba trying to do shalba flew up from where he was and then laughed out loudly fuhahahahahaha annihilation maker is a very splendid and idealistic ability and people say that he specialises in creating antimonsters checking the movements of the herofaction i kidnapped him who was doing a mission with another group from the herofaction now then i will have him create it a monster that can eliminate the current devils of the world zuooooon something was created from the boys shadow a head of something huge was appearing out of it making lots of huge waves in the shadow a head that was too big a torso that was
too large arms that were too thick and overwhelming legs to support the body the thing created from the shadows of the boy that covers the whole field was gogaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a very gigantic monster it made a very loud roar that felt like it would destroy my eardrums huge it was two heads bigger than great red a monster about 200 meters tall an outrageous and huge monster was created sensei did tell me annihilation maker could create any type of monster depending on the possessors powers but it could even create a monster like this and other monsters smaller than this one appeared from the boys shadow as well buuuuuun a large magiccircle was created below the monsters feet that was a transportation magiccircle shalba shouted while laughing fuhahahahahaha im planing to transport these monsters to the underworld to have them wreak havoc its a humongous antimonster it will certainly eliminate lots of devils in the underworld the magiccircle glowed and the monsters were enveloped with the light of transportation this is bad at this rate those monsters will be transported to the underworld and wreak havoc we need to stop them here stop themunder senseis order we attacked
the monsters but our attacks werent working we only gave enough damage to scrape their surfaces a bit the attacks were useless and all of the monsters disappeared into the light the moment the monsters disappeared guooooon this field also started to make a weird noise looking carefully there was a scar created in the white sky and the buildings including the hotel started to collapse this field started to become unstable because of the forceful birth of monsters and their transportation georg then shouted at siegfried the device wont last long damn shalba did he use the ability that surpasses the capacity of the possessor by force we cant help it looks like its time for us to leave lets retreat once after retrieving leonardo pluto how about siegfried stopped there and realised the disappearance of the grim reaper that grim reaper disappeared all of a sudden seeing that it seems like siegfried understood something i see so the one who was helping shalba from the shadows was its something that skullgod would think of so he wont choose any sort of method to annoy us did he also tell the method to forcefully use the balancebreaker of annihilation
maker we dont know what kind of price or side effect it could have to do a temporary balancebreaker like that we were trying to increase the power of leonardo slowly now this boy is saying that siegfried and georg recovered the boy they then disappeared from here along with the mist those bastards they sure are fast running away dooooon dooon this time it was the sound of explosions coming from the hotel what is it it sure is a busy day today looking up shalba was attacking the rearguardswhats wrong valiiiiiiii what happened to your proud demonicpowers you power of the hakuryuukou what happened to it fuhahahahaha you are just a mixed breed between human so there was no way for you to win against me who is the real maou shalba was attacking vali i dont think the current vali can withstand shalba activating a defence magiccircle vali could only defend it seemed like he wasnt in a good situation i dont want to hear it from you who names himself a maou while borrowing the powers of others even so vali talked back to shalba fuhahahahahahahahahhahahahah it only matters if you win in the end now
there is one more thing i want shalba pointed his hand towards ophis a spiral demonic power appeared and it wrapped ophis up like a rope he captured ophis hou just like the information i gathered said the current ophis has an unstable power and even my current self can capture her this is a gift to the cooperative partner of this i the real maou i will have her give me a snake again since my powers are down i will be taking her now like hell i will let you jet i expanded my dragonwings and closed the distance between shalba immediately he said it while laughing madly a curse this is a curse i shall become the poison who will devour the underworld those devils who declined me i have no business with such an underworld i dont care about them anymore i dont care about the authority and possession of the underworld anymore fuhahahaha this shalba beelzebub shall use his last bit of power to destroy the underworld together with the monsters shalbas expression was covered with madness this guy didnt have proper eyes now this guy was totally crazy he then pointed at me yes
the children you care deeply about will be terminated by my cursemy monsters sekiryuutei suffer receiving my curse struggle die while coughing out blood fuhahahahaha this is a masterpieceincluding the inferior lowclass and midclass children of devils even the offspring of elites will die in the same way see this is the world you guys have been hoping for the world where there is no discrimination fuhahahahaha what a scumbag he only has revenge on his mind to the underworld who rejected him he doesnt have any pride or attachment to them but it doesnt mean he can shove his anger onto the children while this is going on the field was also collapsing finally holes appeared and started to suck in the remainings of this dimension kuroka who was inside the hotel shouted this field is at its limit nyan if it is now we should be able to transfer so i will activate the magiccircle then all of us will leave this place the gremory group gathered around kuroka asia was healing vali who was wounded from shalbas attack fuhahahaha shalba was still laughing near him was ophis who was captured seeing that i thought about two things
ise we will transfer now come over here quickly rias said that to me but i i didnt go over there ise i said it with a smile to rias who seemed puzzled and along with my comrades i will go and rescue ophis i will also beat up shalba along with it everyone got shocked at what i said i will also fight there is no point to show off by yourself kiba and akenosan said that but i shook my head no it will be enough with just me you guys have to go to the underworld to tell them about the threat eitherway this dimension wont last long rightif it is me i can still move around in the dimensional gap with this armour for a while after the field collapses it seemed like there was a time when vali did the same i cant let shalba get away and also i cant have ophis be handed to someone i think this is something only i can do senseis artificial balancebreaker was at its limits if i dont take down shalba here then there will be more victims he said that he will kill the kids in
the underworld just thati cant forgive its at the limit nyan we wont be able to transfer unless we do it now kuroka shouted hyoudou issei vali was borrowing senseis shoulder he seemed to be in pain the attack from shalba must have made his condition worse vali i will beat shalba up on your behalf as well hearing that vali smiled ise i will open the dragongate afterwards to summon you and ophis you are okay with that right i nod at senseis suggestion i will leave it to you sensei i expanded my dragonwings and started the booster on my back ise the voice of my beloved when i turned around rias was standing there come back to me no matter what yes i will definitely come back saying that i went towards shalba at the same time the light increased looks like everyone transferred safely i will beat shalba and definitely return to riass side bringing ophis along with me part 3i arrived in front of shalba who was laughing above the hotel the collapse of the dimension was getting even worse half of the field had already perished seeing me he made an unpleased expression i
can understand vali coming after me but for a failure of a heavenly dragon such as yourself to come after me how much do dragons have to look down on me yeah yeah he sure does look down on others what is your reason for coming after me are you also trying to ignore me one who carries the blood of the real maou or are you trying to obtain power by having ophis its you who is a heavenlydragon you must be hiding the desire to dominate the human world and underworld it seemed like he only had things like bloodlines and domination in his head i said this after sighing even if you say something complicated that i dont understand i dont know what i should do with ophis and im not interested in dominating either except i said it while pointing at him with my fingers you said you would kill the kids earlier right i cant allow that he laughed at my words what about it this is natural devils that grew up in an underworld managed by the fake maou they are lower than bugs even if i did allow them to grow up into
adulthood they still wont show me the true maou the respect i deserve so devils like them should all just disappear that is why i will use those gigantic monsters to return everything to zero those monsters are antimonsters created by annihilation maker so they are insanely strong they will cause overwhelming destruction a pure underworld will be reborn in the wake of its destruction that is what the underworld should be this is hopeless i began to think that sirzechssama is the best maou there is once again i really cant understand your delusions at all but you are trying to kill the children of the devils righti just couldnt forgive that in my head the smiling faces of children appeared yeah dont worry i will protect you kids i will protect their smiles i said it while emitting all of the aura from within me then i will have to beat you up i am playing the role of the childrens hero after all i just cant forgive guys like you who are enemies of children i am the oppai dragon after all hearing me he stopped smiling the pressure coming out from you has increased you are
a heavenly dragon who acts in ways i cant possibly understand well then get tainted from my curse and die in this dimensional gap red dragon you are the one that is going to die you lowly devil i made the evil piece within me explode in a crimson colour cardinal crimson promotion the truequeen that was named by my rival sairaorgsan i the one to awaken am the sekiryuutei who holds up the truth of the king uphigh i could hear the voices of the senpai lets go hyoudou issei yeah that is right future we are sekiryuutei who protect everyones future it is the time to walk the crimson road of righteousness holding the infinite hope and indestructible dream and walking the road of righteousness i will become the emperor of the crimson dragon this is the new chant my words of righteousness that are different than juggernautdrive and i will lead you to the path of heaven glowing in deeptruecrimson light cardinal crimson full drive a crimson aura enveloped me and started to colour my armour crimson crimsonarmour what is this change crimson an ominous colour that reminds me of the crimson hair of that fake man
shalba said that to me crimson is the best colour my armour changed a bit and at the same time my power was increasing this enormous power of sekiryuutei around me is real its still growing but this is enough for now now i just have to beat you down in this form shalba pointed his hands at me a warp was created and bugs no bees something that looks like bees appeared the whole area was covered with bees i will show you the power of the real beelzebub shalba then controled the army of bees in creating many circles and he then started to randomly shoot out enormous masses of aura from them star sonic booster i dodged them instantly and closed the distance between us i followed through by releasing my punch directly into his stomach solid impact booster a crimsonaura covered my right arm and shaped itself into a large fist by slamming down the nail located on the elbow i precisely performed a body blow hit my fist goes deep into his stomach guha shalba coughed out blood you low lifeeeeeeee shalba created many magiccircles and just like rossweissesan he shot out a full burst
of different elemental attacks but each and everyone of his attacks was thick i went ahead towards them without dodgingthis i dont need to dodge these things i hit away his attacks with my fists and shortened our distance with godspeed upclose i released my fist at him again solid impact booster don a gigantic fist hit his face getting hit by my punch head on shalba had blood coming out from all over his face seeing that i spoke because of boredom is this it hearing that lots of veins appeared on shalbas face what i said it to him without caring that he was pissed you said you were a maou so i thought you had power like that of sirzechssama and vali i fought both of them so i can understand the power of the maou lucifer but i dont feel any strong pressure from you like i did from them shalba then laughed loudly you sure say a lot a mere rotten dragon a former human who is the same as garbage to make a fool of this real maou i am the red dragon of the two heavenly dragon sekiryuutei i wont lose to a
fake maou like you nonsense you rotten dragooooooooon if he shoots his demonic powers i hit them away if i punch then his body curves i shoot down creepy bees with my dragon shot as well i was at an overwhelming advantage this is it just this the man who spoke about the underworld sirzechssama and sairaorgsan were able to stand normally even after being hit by this howabout you then you just get thrown back after being hit your eyes dont even have any glitters shalba you may have great talent and demonicpowers you were born with things greater than me thats right i am a devil that was chosen a maou the real maou but its no good your attacks are nothing compared to the man who came at me with only his fist and body you wont be able to defeat me with attacks like that don after a few hits this time it felt like i finished it shalbas face is also covered with pain i can defeat him without juggernautdrive real maou my ass making the underworld go back to zero you say the men of the underworld i have met and fought werent this
nave everyone was stronger and stricter than anyone else you shitty heavenly dragon how about thissssssss while sprinkling blood shalba created a magiccircle within his hand what appeared from there wasa single arrow pyuu it flew at me high velocity and hit my right arm piercing through my armour this wont i tried to pull out the arrow then intense pain hit me through my arm intense pain spread throughout my body at the same time it felt like my power was leaving me my hands are shaking whatis this shalba laughed seeing that fuhahahahaha its painful right its hard to endure right of course the tip of that arrow is covered with the blood of samael i received it from hades i kept it to use against vali just in case but for me to use it against garbage like you no matter now with this the situation is reverted if you have high demonicpowers like vali then you could have endured it a bit but for someone like you who seems to have no talent in demonicpowers then you will diei see samaels blood this is the poison and curse of the dragon eater wait you allied with
hades then that means that this guy lured that grim reaper here it seems like the reason why pluto ran away first lies behind that what are they plotting between herofaction and oldmaou faction killing between groups sensei and siegfried did say they just wanted to annoy them but it sure hurts a lot if i think about it this is my first time receiving dragonslayer damage my body was cold and in pain shaking it even reached here partner its so strong that i lost my consciousness at certain times so samaels curse even reached ddraig who is just a soul gough blood also came out from my mouth its different from the pain from a holy sword but since i received a stab from a holy sword i can somehow withstand this pain getting used to pain is a bit weird but this is because i have been through battles where i might have died well anyway i just need to beat this guy before me i expanded my dragon wings and flew towards shalba he became shocked after seeing me you are supposed to have received a curse why can you move why arent you afraid are
you telling me you are not afraid of death shut up of course i am scared but it seems like even scarier things will happen if i leave you alive thats why i will beat you up first boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost hithit hit combo of punches and kicks getting hit shalba falls onto the roof of the hotel absurd i am the real maou i tried to accomplish my vengeance by seeking the help of hades and humans and dealt with the shame and embarrassment i even went through the experiments of the hero factions that made me puke but why are the heavenly dragons such as you and vali getting in my way a mere dragon who doesnt even have a huge dream or ideal why do you ignore someone like me who is seeking to go even higher i cant understand i really cant understandhe goes to where the captured ophis is and asks her ophis ophis give me that snake one more time then i shall attain the power that is beyond the previous maou i need that snake to beat this man right now i
am unstable i cant make the snaketype that increases strength shalba put on a face of despair after hearing ophis i landed in front of him he looked up at me trembling i then said it you tried to take away the smiles of the children that is enough of a reason for you to get beaten up i i am the childrens hero who plays the role of oppaidragon if you are trying to take their future away from them then i will kill you here i made cannons appear from my wings and started to get ready to fire a blast a quiet impulse of aura enormous power is being charged in the cannon shalba took his wings out and tried to run away i wont let him get away hearing an idiotic ideal like yours im not nice enough to let you get away blow away crimson blasteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer fang blast booster zubaaaaaaaaaaan enormous amounts of crimson aura were released from the cannons fuhahahahahaha either way you will also die from samaels curse sekiryuutei a red aura enveloped shalba who was screamingi who had defeated shalba released ophis from the ropes made from demonicpower while enduring samaels curse
ophis then questioned me sekiryuutei why did you help me i said it while sighing you saved asia and irina that was my gratitude towards them it should not be a reason for sekiryuutei to help me asia and irina are my important friends if you saved them then a reason for me to save you will also exist i began to think that you are not a bad guy why did you cooperate with them they promised me that they will defeat great red i want to return to the dimensional gap and obtain silence theres no way that they will keep their promises werent you used by them a lot if i can defeat great red then thats okay thats why i gave them snakes dream ophiss aim ophis continues i went to sekiryuuteis house because i thought i could find something that would fulfill my dream abnormal growth i thought the secret behind the true dragon and heavenly dragon lied there i thought i could find the reason why i exist i see i finally got it this guy is purer than anyone oldmaou faction and herofaction used that they used her for their own deeds their
ambitions to control the world or to seek a battle against superior beings but that is something irrelevant to ophis this guy isnt a lastboss at all it was all an illusional boss that the khaosbrigade created im glad i rescued her i think this guy is someone who i can talk to unlike shalba i will take her home and speak with her about many things i thought she was creepy but she is just a pure dragon who is merely nave she is strong and infinite everyone became scared of her andmade her into something people would fear she was tricked into becoming the leader of the terrorists a lonely and poor dragon that is ophis my consciousness is getting worse is it because of the curse geez i need to get home quickly hey ophis do you want to become friends with me friend whats the benefit if i become that i could at least become someone you can talk to i see that sounds fun yeah it is fun thats why lets go home to that house the building collapsed and the surroundings were being sucked into the hole a field that is collapsing even if
i go into the dimensional gap i will be safe for a while if i wear my armour i will be alright as long as everyone summons me before that i got up and walked forward to return homelife the crumbling field im walkingin that field but i dont have the strength to walk any more im going forwardwhile having ophis lend me her shoulder its the effect of the curse its truly ironic since im having ophis help me when i came to rescue her my eyesight is getting blurry thats weird since im not even sleepy i dont feel the painfrom samaels curse now it doesnt hurtnor is it painful partner its almost time azazel and the others are probably about to open the dragon gate for us then the only thing left for them is to summon us ddraig i know it lets go on oh yeah what should i do once i get home reflect onwhat i did wrong for the promotion test with everyone oh yeahwe still have the midsemester test as well once i gethome i will first hey ophis what do you want to do once you return return i do not have
any place to return to the dimensional gap i do not have the power to return to it then you can returnto my place the house of sekiryuutei yeah thats right if you were able to get along withasiaand irinathen you can get along witheveryone else as wellmy legswont go any further huh my sightgoes to the sideand then up did i fall down no i cant even tell that ophis have you everfallen in love with someone what am i saying howeveri can seethat beautifulcrimson hairin my mind partner get a hold of yourself everyone is waiting for you yeah i know asiais a crybaby so i have to return quickly akenosanis a very fragile personeven if she looks like thatand konekochanim glad shes getting along with ravel xenoviaand irinai remember when they were enemies at first ddraig this person has the curse circulating through his entire body hes at his limits i know that ophis i already know that but he wont die this man has always kept on standing up rossweissesangasperhurry and comehome azazelsenseikibamatsuda motohamamy important lets go home partner what are you doing stand up you always stood up sairaorgsanvalii stillwant to fightyou guys riasthe one
i love ise come back to me im glad thati confessed to heri will definitelyreturn toyourside i love you rias im gladthat i could at leastsay that ddraig this person isnt moving yeah ddraig you are crying yeah i only known him for a short time yeah he wasnt a bad person he was my first friend yeah it was fun hey ophis no this mans last friend what is it can you listen to my story for a bit before i move on to a new host okay i want you to remember this man forever let me talk about him was he a good sekiryuutei yeah this is the story about the man who was the best sekiryuuteilost life in front of me kiba yuuto there is a ritual being performed by azazelsensei along with the help of the former dragonking tanninsama the preparation of the summoning magic circle is complete we will open the dragongate sensei said that and the magic circle started to glow we the gremory group and those who are involved are at the place where the promotion of midclass devils test took place we were on the transportation floor azazelsensei drew a magiccircle
to call dragons on the whole floor of the basement hes trying to open the dragongate in order to call out isekun kuroka is also helping with that after the battle in the artificial dimension we moved to a place where we could draw a magiccircle to summon isekun and are currently opening the dragongate to summon isekun by force we called the former dragonking tanninsama immediately for his assistance in opening the dragongate of course the hakuryukou white dragon emperor vali is waiting at the side of the magiccircle while enduring the damage caused by samaels curse buchou and my comrades are looking at them with anxious expressions after that the monsters created by the annihalation maker in the artificial dimension appeared in the underworld and they have begun their attacks on each of the main areas of towns the counterattack squads have already been deployed by both the devils side and the fallenangels side but they are having a hard time due to the large area they have to cover and the formidable monsters apparently the monsters are creating more antimonsters by themselves while they are advancing forward then the remnants of the oldmaou factions joined them and
began to attack towns and villages that were along the routes of the gigantic monsters the god from the realm of the dead hades was helping both the oldmaou faction and the herofaction from behind the scenes he was sticking his evil hands around to the point where even the herofaction was fooled by him a scheme hades probably made so he could cause a blow to the devils fallenangels or other factions as a result because of hades actions the gigantic monsters have appeared in the underworldright about now hes probably looking at this situation with glee im also worried about ophiss power that was stolen by cao cao the birth of a new ophis by using that power the situation is gradually growing so serious that it seems like the maousama are persuading each of the factions but the existence of cao cao who holds the holyspear that can even take down god is a looming threat and they couldnt get cooperation from the superiorbeings a spear that can kill maou and god if a god from a certain faction or the maou was to be killed by that spear the status quo of the factions will be
overturned having that in mind it became hard for the higherups to move due to that young devils with power like us and the teams of ultimateclass devils received the mission to take down the monsters we are devils with great power we have to proceed forward and fight since maousama can not battle sairaorg bael is also heading out there are reinforcement squads dispatched from those factions who we have alliances with from the heavens the brave saints from the fallenangel sides the sacred gear possessors from northern europe the valkyrie squads they have responded to the crisis of the underworldthe devils side since the gods and maou can not move the people below them have to xenovia and irinasan successfully told the circumstances to the higher ups of each faction i heard that they are currently in heaven repairing durandal but at this rate the monsters will destroy the capital located in the maous territory the evacuation of the civilians had already started but its a grave situation as we dont know if we will make it in time we need your power isekun the time for you to use the power of the sekiryuutei for the underworld
has come there are many children in the capital waiting for you to come thats why please come back yes its connectedsensei shouted and the magiccircle started to glow the jewel of fafnir that sensei held glowed in a golden colour valis body also emitted a whitelight tanninsamas body also glowed in a purple colour and the light spread throughout the whole floor i blocked the dazzling light with my hands and the light stopped we then looked at the centre of the magiccircle at the centre of the magiccircle what appeared was 8 evil pieces of pawn eh whwhat does this mean i couldnt understand this phenomenon whats in front of me isnt isekun butevilpieces thats it and those evilpieces have the same crimson colour as the evil pieces that buchou had but it isnt isekun isekun isnt there instead there are only 8 pawn pieces for a moment we didnt know what this meant sensei dropped lifelessly onto his knees and hit the floor you idiot with the words sensei let out we started to realize what happened akenosan sat on the spot lifelessly buchou went into a daze while standing wheres isesan eh asiasan said it with
a puzzled expression ravelsan hugged onto konekochan who wasnt showing any reaction and she started to shake her head really hard saying no while weeping you are not fair isekun just to return the evilpieces you said you would definitely come back the tears that are falling down from my cheeks didnt stop for a while that day we lost isekunafterword this is ishibumi who has started doing diet from summer at the end of november i have lost 10 kilograms no i was examined for the health examination on summer its not that i am very sick but i need to change my diet im only controlling my calories but it sure does make me lose weight volume 11 ended like what is this the end this will be the first half of a two part story battle danger relying on riass breasts ise powers up victory is this the victory pattern of gremory group even during the story both enemy and allies realised that this is a very threatening thing gremory team basically mains in offensive fighting style if you look at the members you can tell immediately that their offensive power is overwhelming if rias orders take
them down they can take out most enemies easily thats why they have a high risk of their team breaking down when they face enemies who specialises on techniques and foe who has seal or barrier type abilities this time cao cao and georg saw that and defeated gremory team magnificently i made this team turn out like this because the team the protagonist belongs to should be something that goes heads towards the enemy to make the story much easier to explain i though if the main character goes around energetically it will be easier for the readers to symphonise with the plot but this isnt a group that backs down and remains being defeated from the battle from last volume and this volume everyone realises what they specialises in and also what they lack in and started to build a powering up plan and started to search for their powers please support their growth from now as well but xenovia is a bit lacking lately she only has the spotlight when she does an attack before the battle starts or when she uses the durandal cannon or when she gets beaten up and also riass breasts that haveawakened
we cant see the limits for our switchprincess when she pairs up with ise they show a bakauple power of miracle so this is oppaipower and koneko also proposes by having a step ahead of other girls but kuroka also came rushing in how many bride candidate will there be for the oppai dragon it truly is terrifying the worlds unluckiestdragonddraig he is suffering because of the hosts love towards breast he is heart broken that he cant remain himself unless he has medicine apply on him everyone please support the worlds most pitiful dragon ddraig now i have done a survey through fujimi shobo homepage and shops and i have found something very shocking the popularity ise gained is something that puts him in top3 out of all the characters and he surpasses the popularity of other heroines to tell you the truth his popularity is beyond what we expected a main character that is loved even more than the heroine the truth is looking back through the story regardless of enemy or allies the number of bishounen is higher than bishoujo but a character who is supposed to be very popular the head of all the good looking
guys kibakyun i also receive kind comments like please give kiba a girlfriend but kiba is part of ises harem no i mean best friend but ise who is even more popular than the goodlooking guy what on earth happened to him next volume lots of amazing things might happen this volume was a longinuss balancebreaker parade and thats 5 of them not only does the truelonginuss balancebreaker has many abilities but the wielder is a strong guy who would be considered a cheat level the dimensionlost balancebreaker is a very powerful and absolute barrier that can even stop ophis temporarily annihilationmaker on other hand can mass produce gigantic monsters like that toptier longinus is something that can even destroy a world no wonder it became a toptier other than that i was able to mention the names of all 13 longinus even though they only have a setting so far maybe i cant reveal all of them im thinking it will be great if i can introduce them on another project that is based on the same world dragoneater samael is the ultimate antidragon ophis and the twoheavenly dragons were crushed by its curse but that is just the
problem of affinity and it doesnt necessary mean that he is invincible except samael is a forbidden existence that can make dragons extinct even georg who is a longinus possessor and who is a splendid magician can only control him for a short time even though samael has many restraints on him naturally samael is something that is sealed so this is the end of his appearance and ophis reappeared again she was a lonely child please love her hades and group of grim reapers who are secretlymaneuvering from behind the scene they are the last trickster of the storyarc 3 the arc started with the same trickster character loki so i decided to have a god play that role once again well there were lots of gods in many mythology whom stick their heads in matters due to personal issues i think that is so god like lately i have been imagining of wanting to write a past story of dxd in other words how sirzechs rose up to a maou he became a ace of antimaou faction he meets grayfia a story that ends in him being a maou maybe high school dxd volume 0 it seems like
it will become more serious that the dxdish of it will disappear well this is me just talking to myself so please dont take it seriously and also for the heavens sidei also thought about a spin off story of an exorcist the plot is after the three big powers make an alliance the exorcists started to lose their job well the fallenangels and devils who were supposed to be their enemies arent their enemies anymore its a story where a former ultimateclass exorcist gets dispatched to the peaceful japan and gets himself mixed in a ruckus yes this is all imaginary people who want to read it please go to the publishers the different project which is set in a different world i just mentioned i put too much attention on dxd that it didnt progress at all i was also busy with things related to dxd anime so i had them as first priority not putting too much focus on either of them and both being halfassed seems rude to everyone related to the project so i concentrated on dxd im very sorry now for my thanks miyamazerosama editor hsama subeditor ssama im always under your care it

days after the midclass promotion tests had ended it was noon i kiba yuuto am presently at a floor in the gremory castle the gremory castle is in a ruckus including the employees the gremory personal soldiers are also in a panic the reason is because the underworld is currently undergoing a crisis the super gigantic monsters created by shalba beelzebub from the oldmaou faction using annihilation maker started their progress on attacking every main capital and important location after appearing in the underworld the big screen television located on this floor is showing the appearance of the monsters that have begun their invasion as an emergency broadcast please look the gigantic monsters that suddenly appeared are progressing towards the capitals without stopping the reporters are reporting about the monsters from helicopters or shipplanes that move by demonicpower generators in total there are 13 monsters created by annihilation maker they are monsters that easily exceed 100 meters each one of them is about 150 meters big the television is broadcasting about each of them it seems like we can find out about the current status of each monster from the television when we saw them in the artificial dimension they
were a bunch of humanoid shaped monsters covered in black aura perhaps their appearance changed when they arrived in the underworld but if there are humanoid types there are also beast types that stand on four legs in terms of appearance none of them resemble each other though the humanoid types stand on four legs their heads look like either aquatic creatures or have one eye or have four arms if i were to describe them in one word they look likechimeras similarly the four legged monsters are also mixed with parts of different creatures they continue to progress towards the cities with slow steps without showing any signs of stopping at this rate the monsters that are close to the important cities will arrive there sometime today other monsters will also arrive at their destinations by tomorrow the most annoying thing about them is that they are creating small monsters by themselves as they progress towards their targets body parts of the gigantic monsters start to swell up and lots of small monstersare born by ripping out from their flesh they are only the size of humans but there are simply too many of them dozens to hundreds of
them are created at a single time they destroy the forests mountains and landscapes that they pass through and devour the animals that live there it seems like the civilians who lived in the towns and villages along the monsters path were evacuated with minimal casualties but entire towns were trampled down after they leave the place it looks so ghastly that there is nothing left creatures that are too overpowered so this is the power that was created by toptier longnius annihilation maker as someone who also possesses the same creationtype sacred gear its ability scares me an unusual power that is said to rival that of god an ability that can destroy the world right now that is happening right in front of our eyes among the monsters there is one that is far larger than the others who is heading towards the capital in the maou territory lilith and the monster is something we never expected it is a humanoid type and is a size much larger than the other monsters i can understand the immense size of that thing even through the television screen the government of the underworld named the monster who is far bigger
than others jabberwocky the other twelve monsters are called bandersnatch these were named by azazelsensei by taking the names of the creatures from lewis carrolls work behind the television screen the warriors of the underworld have began their attacks on bandersnatch spreading their wings they either go head on or from the sides or from the back or attack them at the same time by hitting them with a barrage of fire made by demonicpowers demonicpowers that filled the whole area around them are shot towards the monsters the attack teams who are repeating their attacks are ultimateclass devils and their servants normal monsters would definitely perish after receiving such attacks but how can this be the attacks of ultimateclass devils and their teams arent working i can hear the voice of the reporter who is frightened yes what is shown on the television are the monsters that havent even been affected by the attacks of the ultimateclass devils and their servants it is just like the time we were back in the artificial dimension our attacks only damaged their skin they couldnt cause any critical damage the attack teams that were dispatched are all ultimateclass devils whohold the top
rankings of the rating game even so they still couldnt do any damage that could cause any effect its also because they have their hands full with the small monsters that are being created as well even so the gigantic monsters have very hard bodies for each one of the monsters squads were dispatched by the factions that are allied with the devils such as the fallenangels who sent their squads bravesaints that were sent by heaven and the valkyrie squads that consists of battle maidens that were sent by the valhalla and large troops of warriors sent by the greek factions thanks to that we have avoided the worst case scenario but there are still many problems one of them is jabberwocky who is even more powerful than these monsters last night the group led by dihauza belial was dispatched but although they were able to cause damage to jabberwocky they could only stall its movement for a matter of seconds jabberwocky regenerated from its damage very quickly and healed itself it then resumed its journey as if nothing had happened that truth became an astonishing thing that spread around the news and resulted in making the civilians feel
even more unease everyone thought and believed that if the emperor and his servants were dispatched then they could even defeat the gigantic monsters there are no doubts about the strength of emperor belial and his servants even us the gremory group can not defeat them even if we were in our best condition thats how powerful they are however even people like them couldnt do it the other problem is the oldmaou faction who began their coup dtat using this crisis as an opportunity most likely the invasion of monsters was a part of their plan and they are rampaging in the cities aligning with it the warriors of the underworld were also dispatched to take care of them as well the world of the devils is in chaos right now we also received a report that because of this chaos there are servants of highclass devils who are rebelling against their masters in various locations i can easily imagine that the sacred gears possessors who were made into servants by force are releasing their anger at this situation if i were to say it like sensei then this situation would be a balance breaker bargain sale warriors from
various factions were also sent out to take care of them but we wont be able to lose any more manpower than this we need to stop the progression of the monsters first if we were to lose importantlocations and capitals then there wouldnt be any better opportunity to invade the underworld than at that moment yes at this point in time the underworld is heading into very serious chaos coup dtat by the oldmaou faction through the use of gigantic monsters it seems like the one who was pulling the strings from the back is the god of the realm of the dead hades and we also dont know where khaos brigades herofaction is plotting their next move from in that artificial dimension it seemed like the herofactions were fooled by hades and the oldmaou faction but what would the descendants of the heroes do in this situation they are terrorists after all so they wouldnt take actions that we can predict the reason why gods and maousama can not go and take care of the monsters themselves is because we dont know where cao cao would be targeting them from that spear has the power to easily eliminate
maou and gods if even a single god or maou was to be killed we dont know what will happen to the balance of each faction and we dont even know when hades will send his grim reapers what is fortunate is that the evacuations of civilians are being taken care of as the first priority and there havent been any major casualties if the devils were to go down in numbers any more than this then the future of devils will be put in a very dangerous situation more than that there is no way that sirzechssama would think of the safety of civilians as his second priority but at this rate the underworld will so this must be the grudge shalba beelzebub and the oldmaou faction have towards the current government of the underworld it seems like servants of maousama will finally be dispatched to take care of jabberwocky and bandersnatch a sudden voice when i turned around raiser phoenix was standing there i was thinking very hard while looking at the television seriously so i couldnt notice him getting close to me raiser phoenix makes a sigh i came here as my brothers escort i also came
to check on ravel and rias along with it but since the situation is like this i can sympathise with you kiba yuuto raiser phoenix narrows his eyes and puts on a serious face his it seems like the death of isekun has already reached this person as well yes we lost one of our important comrades hyoudouissei the sekiryuutei at the starting point of this crisis isekun went to retrieve ophis who was taken by shalba beelzebub on his own we tried to summon him back with the dragongate after returning back to our world but what came back to us were the evilpieces only 8 pawn evilpieces only the evilpieces came back but along with his evilpieces the aura of samael was also detected so we could only think that isekun received the curse of samael during his battle against shalba he couldnt return for that reason we dont know how the power of samaels curse was released but the aura of samael definitely came past the dragongate shalba must have made an alliance with hades there is no way for him to be safe after receiving samaels curse because he has insufficient demonicpowers to defend against it
we were told that clearly by azazelsensei in the past there were cases where only the evilpieces were summoned and i heard that in all of them the person summoned was definitely not alive servants who have a strong will to return only their evilpieces can make that phenomenon occur and evilpieces that have returned have already stopped functioning and can not be used ever again we also had the heavens check for what happened to the spirit of the sekiryuutei that is because the sekiryuutei ddraig goes to seek a new host automatically when the current host dies information like that gets recorded in the sacred gear database though it seems like the current longinus possessors specifics became very complex compared to the past possessors and for that reason information like that hasnt come in yet the longinus observation institute of the grigori is also searching for any available information right now but we were told beforehand that receiving proper information would be very shallow beforehand and the whereabouts of ophis who should have been with isekun is also unknown she might have stayed in the dimensional gap or she might have perished with samaels curse the search for
the dragongod is still underway but it is said that the chance of her being sent to hades by shalba is very low that is because there is no way that isekun wouldnt have finished off shalba if it is him he definitely would have taken down shalba even if he were to bet his life for it including me everyone believes that but no matter how much we search there arent any leads that would reject the information of his deathhis death hasnt been reported and only one group of people know about it but we there is no way we could accept it that easily im very sorry to hear that were you able to meet with buchou i somehow managed to get my head straight and asked raiser phoenix but he shook his head i couldnt she didnt open her door she didnt even respond when i called her well shes not in a situation where i can meet her since the man she loves ended up like that then there was someone who put a teacup on the table its konekochan here is your tea konekochan who has the same expression as always goes and sits
on the chair in the corner after putting the cup on the table listen ravel in any case you have to cheer up two more people appear one is a man the other one is ravelsan i am familiar with the man well only from television that is he is oldest son of the house of phoenix and the next head ruval phoenix he has a graceful face and unlike raiser phoenix who dresses up like a delinquent he wears proper noble clothes he seems very gentle and he shines just by standing he is someone who has been in the top10 of the rating game before there are also rumours that he will be promoted to an ultimateclass devil very soon i see so raiser phoenix came as this persons escort after he cheers up ravelsan he notices me you must be riassans knight since it is a situation like this you should be okay then he takes out several little bottles from his pocket while he approaches me theyre phoenix tears we came to give you this along with seeing our sister and riassan since we are in a situation like this we can only give these to
the counterattack squads i feel very sorry for talented youths like your group soon i will also go to counterattack the monsters along with my foolish brotherso the phoenix brothers will also go join the pursuit of the monsters certainly the immortal phoenix will be a very big support at the front line of the battle sorry for being foolish raiser phoenix is unpleased by his brothers words the house of phoenix has many siblings four siblings which is very rare among current highclass devils the oldest and the third son participate in the rating game and i hear that the second son is one of the bosses of the media i received the tears from ruval he must have given this to us believing that we will also go to the front lines ruval smiles while doing a karate chop on raiser phoenixs head riassan and also riassans queen are both very depressed at sekiryuuteikuns death the one who should be calm at times like this is you a servant who has deep love towards his comrades but can withstand a comrades death remarkable thank you very muchthe truth is i cant endure it any longer but i still
have to endure thats because like he just said buchou and akenosan who arent here are not in proper shape buchou has hid inside her room in the castle while holding onto isekuns evil pieces and since akenosan also lost her psychological support she is sitting on the sofa in the guest room with a hollow expression both of them do not respond when i try to talk to them it is hard to imagine what they are going through right now because both of them were very dependent on isekuns support asiasan has also been crying this whole time in the guest room i want to go to isesans side right this moment but if i were to go to his sideisesan will definitely be upset he promised me that he will always be with me then i thought i will be able to be with him if i go to his side isesan what should i do she was also fighting desperately against her sadness xenovia and irinasan are still in heaven im not sure whether isekuns death has been reported to them i heard the reason why xenovia someone who knows the absence of god is able
to stay in heaven while she would have an influence on the system based there is because of the cooperation from azazelsensei and the system of the immense tree from norsemythology yggdrasil but she can only stay there for a short time even if we receive lots of cooperation from different factions it will still take lots of time to unravel the system of heaven which is delicate and has many secrets rossweissesan and gapserkun also didnt call us after leaving to become stronger they still havent been told about isekuns death the gremory group are all separated until recently it was such an ultimate team that you couldnt ask for more but now there isnt even a shadow of it even if the members who arent here right now return we dont know if we are able to return back to the original situation losing isekun who was the foundation of the team was big am i able to support this team isekun please give me a bit of your courage the courage you had that allowed you to stand up against anyone ruval then says it our family also wanted ravel to become sekiryuuteikuns servant and possibly send
her off to him if we could haveyes i understand that isekun didnt notice it but the intention of the house of phoenix could be understood from many perspectives what will happen to ravels future isnt decided but can you allow her to stay here it seems like she made friends i think their names were konekosan and gasperkun she talked a lot about both of them through the magiccircle she seemed very happy yes we will take care of ravelsan ruval smiles at my words yes then we are going raiser you will have to show off the splendid flames of the pheonix since you are also a male from the house of the phoenix you dont want to be made fun of for being an upstart guy any more than this right i understand brother see ya kiba yuuto take care of rias and the others ruval and raiser phoenix leave after saying thatthe room becomes quiet once again ravelsan sits next to konekochan her eyes get full with tears and she covers her face with her hands this is too much for me i was finally able to get closer to the man i respect and have
affection towards ravelsan had deep affection towards isekun she must have respected him deeply she usually had a tsun personality but at times she looked at isekun as her hero she must have wanted to live under him being his servant konekochan then mumbled i was somehow prepared for this no matter how strong isesenpai and yuutosenpai are there will be a time when they reach their limit konekochan you had a resolution like that so she was already prepared it would be the natural way of thinking considering that we went through lots of near death experiences up until now isekun and i had secretly talked about this before about things after one of us dies hearing konekochan ravelsan stands up enraged she talks back to konekochan while crying you are accepting it too fast i cant be strong like konekosan konekochan received frustration from her fellow classmate her usual emotionless face starts to break down and she eventually started to shake and cry i also i also reached my limits in many ways he died after i confessed my feelings isesenpai is stupid hes stupid konekochan hid her eyes with her sleeve while crying out she must have
been forcing herself to stay calm she kept her sorrow in even when she gave out tea things she kept within her small body start to flow out all at once seeing that ravelsan gently embraces konekochan konekosan im sorry sobravel its too painful to bear this is too muchfor the two 1st years his death was too much for them i need to endure a bit longer even if i cry right nownothing will start it is not the time for that yet kiba yuutokun another voice when i turned around one of the leaders of the fallenangels barakielsan was standing there i see then akeno is we walk through the corridor while i explain the situation to barakielsan im taking him to the guest room where akenosan is barakielsan is akenosans father he had a painful expression he is sad knowing both about isekun and akenosan i asked konekochan and ravelsan to look after asiasan both of them are not in a condition to do that but by having someone who loved isekun as well stay with asiasan seemed to be the right thing to do i am no good i am a knight that is supposed to
support the girls but i can not save a single girl from our group thats why im thinking of protecting them by wielding my sword that is the best thing i can currently do for the girls we arrived in front of the door where akenosan is in and i knock on the door there is no response from the inside barakielsan and i open the door and enter there was no light inside and it is dark akenosan is sitting on the sofa located in the corner of the room with hollow eyes barakielsan took a step and shakes his daughters shoulder akeno maybe it is because she heard the voice of her father but she finally responds for the first time tousama she mumbles while confirming her fathers face barakielsan just nods silently and hugs akenosan i heard the storyhearing that akenosan got her emotions back and puts her face on her fathers chest tousamai her voice is mixed with tears barakielsan gently pats his daughters head you can cry right now your father will be here until you stop but you are the queen of the gremory group which is turning into a representative of all the
young devils you have to use that power for the underworld soon sobisewhy akenosan cries within his arms if barakielsan is here then akenosan might recover a bit i will be a nuisance if i stay any longer sensing that i quietly left the room part 2 while returning to the floor i had been on before i passed someone i knew sajikun yo kiba what brings you here well kaichou came to see how riassenpai is doing so i came to escort her we met with people from the house of phoenix on our way i see thank you so kaichou also came to see buchous well being i then walk along with sajikun he then says it with resolved eyes kiba im planning to participate in this case im going to protect the civilians living in town it looks like the sitri group also stood up for the underworlds crisis youths with power are being summoned there is no doubt that the greatking bael group and archduke agares will be dispatched as well it wouldnt be weird if the sitri group were to be dispatched as well naturally we will also have to participate as youths that have
powerwe are also planning to join with you afterwards i say that but sajikun asks me with concern are riassenpai and the others able to fight it will be natural to feel that way knowing the situation of buchou and others right now he knows it he knows that we wont be able to fight properly with the current situation even so we must go we have to fight all the devils that have powers are summoned to it we are devils who have powers we have to do it yeah you are right sajikun puts on a smile but then puts on a serious face do you know the one who killed hyoudou sajikun asks with eyes full of intensity i do but hes no longer in this world he must have been defeated by isekun yes there is no way that isekun couldnt finish off shalba even if he received the poison of samael he definitely must have eliminated shalba i believed that without the slightest of doubts sajikuns eyes shake for a moment with my answer yeah striking back when getting hit no theres no way he would lose he died after winning right theres no way
he would lose sajikun had lots of tears flowing out of his eyes and he seems really mortified sajikun says it with a vigorous expression so the guy who killed him is already gone then i just have to beat khaosbrigade which was the group that the guy who killed him belonged to sajikun you he was my aim i was able to work this hard because of him i was able to do well in the match against agares as well i was able to endure any type of hard training because he was also the same pawn as me who was nearbyhe has been running after isekuns back for sajikun isekun who became a devil at the same time as himself was a big existence to him sajikun then spits out words of hatred i wont forgive those guys who took away my aim and killed my friend i will burn all of them with the flame of vritra my flame is a cursed blackflame that wont disappear even if i die i will take down their lives even at the cost of my own sajikun is emitting an intense aura from his body he is keeping down
his power which seems like it will explode now i will be troubled if you die saji when i turned around sonakaichou is standing there kaichou saji i can understand you becoming emotional but i will be troubled if you die if you are going to do it burn your opponents while you stay alive sajikun wiped his tears with his sleeve at her words and then nods his head yes sonakaichou then looks at me we will pardon ourselves here we were given an order from serafall levithian to go to the capital of maou territory lilith to protect the city and evacuate the civilians since strong people with the power of ultimateclass devils are being dispatched to take care of the giganticmonsters the governments are making the skilled youths evacuate civilians and protect the cities so have you met with buchou she nods slowly at my question shes keeping herself in her room she wont respond even if i talk to her so it was no good even with sonakaichou who is her best friend but i called someone who is the most suitable at a time like this most suitablei asked her doubtfully but she makes a
shallow smile she doesnt tell me who that person is who did she call when i returned to the floor the television was showing the circumstances of the capital they were continuing the evacuations lots of people are being lead to safety by the soldiers then the children at the capitals were shown the woman reporter asks one of the children im okay oppaidragon will come and defeat that monster for us the child answers the question with a big smile he is holding onto a toy of oppai dragon then lots of voices and energetic faces appear on the screen yeah oppaidragon will defeat them oppai oppai without showing any anxiety they just believe that the oppaidragon will come to save them come quickly oppaidragon seeing them in high spirits i covered my mouthto desperately stop the feeling i am keeping within me can you see isekun the appearance of the children who are waiting for you they arent even showing a single thread of anxiety they believe that you will come and save them then you have to come back you have to be here why cant you go to them you are their hero please answer them
isekun you cant betray them the children of the underworld are stronger than we think a sudden voice that man is already standing next to me you are hyoudou issei has put something very precious inside the childrens hearts its been a while kiba yuuto i came to see rias it was sairaorg baelsairaorg bael who was called here by sonakaichou arrived in front of buchous room while taking me with him im coming in rias saying just that sairaorg bael goes into buchous room when we walk inside the roomwe found buchou sitting on her table her eyes are even more hollow than akenosans were and are swollen red she must have been crying this whole time sairaorg baels makes a sigh of boredom after getting close to her you show me something very boring rias seeing his attitude buchou asks him with an unpleasant face and voice sairaorg why did you come here i received a call from sona sitri dont worry i received this call privately so not a single thing about what happened to that man has been leaked to the greatking faction if the death of isekun is leaked to the politicians from the greatking
faction then we wont know how they will argue against the current maou government after this chaos isekun has become a very big existence in the underworld it seems like this person understands that i think it is only a matter of time till it is leaked but even so i feel happy for this persons concern sairaorg bael directly says it to buchou lets go it is a crisis in the underworld what is the point for you who has strong servants staying here and being useless we are young devils with great powers and we need to show and demonstrate it to the people behind us and we can stand up to the standard of the higher ups the maousama who has been watching over us with warm eyes he said something very proper the usual buchou would have agreed with that but buchou just looked away it is not my concern so you will fall this low just because your mans whereabouts are unknown rias you were supposed to be a better woman than this hearing sairaorg bael say that buchou throws a pillow at our direction and she gets enrageda world without him i dont care
about the world without ise to me he was that person was he was more important than anyone else for me to live without him she tries to calm down while shedding tears but that man the woman who that sekiryuutei hyoudou issei fell in love with wasnt a woman like this sairaorg said it loud to buchou that man was a strong person who kept on standing up with courage for your dream and living up to your expectations how can the master the woman that man loved have such a low capacity and appearance buchou seems shocked hearing sairaorg baels words sairaorg bael continues stand up rias that man stood up no matter what he stepped forward he just kept on going forward you should know that man who defeated me in a fist fight head on the best something only a rival can understand sairaorg bael must have felt something from isekun in that raiting game through their fists and witnessed isekuns way of life and do you really think that man actually died buchouand i became speechless at hearing sairaorg bael he smiles looking at our reaction then that is something to laugh about theres no
way that man will die i will ask you one thing did that man make love to you yet no he didnt make love to me hearing buchou say that sairaorg laughed loud hahahahahahahahahahaha after he finished his laugh he then says it with eyes full of strength then that man really didnt die theres no way that hyoudou issei will die when theres you and other women that are in love with him he wanted to make love to you the most theres no way he will die without making love to you that is something unreliable but sairaorg baels words had more persuasive power than anything else isnt that the oppaidragon he turns around after saying that i will wait at the battlefield definitely come rias and gremory team how can you call yourselves oppaidragons comrades if you dont protect the children of the underworld who that man tried to protect after saying that he leaves a sudden silence so this is what sonakaichou meant by most suitable yes we could have searched more to find the possibility of his survival we could have searched for his resurrection even if his evil pieces were the only thing that
returned how come we couldnt realise something so simple and easy to understand like that it looked like there was a bit of light in buchous eyes and a bit of hope returned within me sairaorg bael a man who fights only with his fists thats why it seemed like there is something only that man can understand that certainly has reached us part 3 after hearing that a certain someone has shown himself within the castle i was walking towards where he is i also know the reason why that person came most likely to cure the curse that person has on himself that room is located in the basement of the castle the vali team is over there after that incident their leader vali got put in an unfavourable condition so the head of gremory decided to hide them after being asked by sirzechssama and azazelsensei of course having the terrorists in the gremory castle will be a very serious matter even so it is true that they helped usthey helped buchou hearing that the head of the gremory decided to take care of them temporarilythey have been classified as traitors from the herofaction and they are wanted
by various groups right now hiding is also hard for them so the suggestion from the gremory is like a passing boat for them when i entered the room vali is resting in i see members of vali team and an old man with a very small build he had a very wrinkled face with cybertype sunglasses and a pipe in his mouth its the man himself the first sun wukong yes the person i wanted to meet is this person the reason i came down here to the basement is because there is something i want to ask him the first is putting his hand on valis body and he is using sennjutsu to make the ki flow within valis body he moved his hand covered in white touki light from valis stomach to his chest to his neck and then to his mouth gough a black solid came out from valis mouth the first put the black solid into a transparent jar and then closed it with a lid on top of that he put something that looks like a sealing paper and sealed it that is most likely the poison of samael that was inside valis body
the first then smiles i took out most of the curse with the sennjutsu now your body should feel better geez when i thought that the super stupid bikou made a call to me i never thought it was to take care of the vanishing dragon bikou who is sitting on the chair next to the bed had his eyes half opened it seems like the one who called the first was bikou i heard that the first is someone he cant deal with it might be an action taken because he wanted to save vali shut up geezer so will vali recover well this guy is someone with exceptionally high demonicpowers it will be enough if i just give it a start my gratitude firstdono looks like i can fight with this vali gave his gratitude to the first with respect for that hakuryuukou to give respect to someone even the first sun wukong is a very big existence to him first says while smacking bikous head to think about fighting after having the curse lifted a battlemaniac which cant be helped now i will be on my way then since i got to see the idiots faceare you
going somewhere geezer well even if i look like this im sakras vanguard just a little errand at the underworld something you could call taking down a terrorist that sakra sure does make a geezer work hard so the first will also be helping out this time as well he sounds like a very supportive ally but there is one thing bugging me vali voices my suspicions instead firstdono sakra is connected to cao cao right the incident at kyoto the meeting between the youkai and sakras side so where is cao cao standing in sakras mind since he interfered in the meeting yes sakra and cao cao are connected i heard it from azazelsensei but the incident in kyoto doesnt connect then so what does that mean the more we think the more mysterious it gets the first just smiles happily no idea since im just a vanguard of sakra and a freedom geezer at that im not interested in what that baldy god of military arts is thinking it feels like he isnt hiding anything this person didnt have any evil intents from the beginning i can sense him having a naughty personality just like bikou but i
cant sense even the slightest enmity towards us though i would agree if he said that he is using sennjutsu to make us think like that the first says it while putting his hand under his chin but i dont think sakra will rampage you know i dont know what will happen from now he would most likely just watch from the sides though hades overdid it this time hades so i am not mistaking it that his rampage led to this incident if sakra also gets involved then the underworld will have an even bigger crisis on its hands he is a battlegod that is said to have the power where all the yondaimaou have to combine their powers and finally they would have the power which rivals him when the first and valis conversation finished i interrupted their discussion first i have come here because there is something i wanted to ask you what is it holydemonicsword guy this geezer will answer anything he is able toi want to ask you who just touched the curse of sameal in what circumstance can a dragon survive after receiving this curse a daiyoukai1 who mastered youjutsu and sennjutsu the one
who was promoted into a god qtian dshng2 sun wukong how did this person feel when he touched the snake of edens the curse of samael i want to ask him that first of all the body cant be saved from the density of this curse the body will perish first then their soul theres nothing more fragile than a soul which lost its vessel though the soul will also get devoured by the curse and perish quickly now the problem starts from here why didnt the evilpiece which is connected with the soul receive the curse what happened to the sekiryuutei reached the ears of this geezer as well the pieces returned to the master right so this person already knows as well yes only the pieces responded to the summon was the curse of samael detected from the pieces no it wasnt detected samaels aura was only felt from the dragongate his pieces werent cursed with samaels curse it happened just like how i answered when isekuns evilpiece returned sensei examined the evilpiece but it wasnt cursed by samaels curse sensei made sharp eyes after knowing that and returned to grigori headquarters if i think about it now
the doubt of isekuns death had existed from back then all of us me and my comrades thought that cases like the return of the evilpieces would mean death because of the sadness of losing him and learning the facts about previous cases we discarded the possibility of his survival the first puffed his pipe and then smiled at my reply then it means that there is a possibility that his soul is at least safe i dont know what state that erotic boy is in but he might just be floating in the dimensional gap when i heard those words i tried very hard to keep down the emotions which were about to come out of me not yet its too early for that its still too early to be overjoyed but there are still possibilities the possibility that my best friend is alivethe first smiles when he sees me shaking and then turns around see you then i have yulong waiting outside oh so what are you going to do now bikou i hear that you guys are wanted by all the factions and khaosbrigade right bikou scratches his cheeks when he gets asked by the first kuroka
who is next to him says it while making a fist im just going to follow our leader nyan afterall i have the most fun hanging around this team the magician le fay also nods yes i will also follow everyone else how about you arthuroniisama arthur who has a calm aura like always says it with a smile i dont have a single interest nor attachment to the herofaction i will be able to meet strong foes if i stay here and do the same things we have been doing till now at least for me its easier to be with vali than cao cao hearing their opinions bikou says it to vali i will also just follow you like i did till now the only one who can order halfassed guys like us is you vali hearing the thoughts of his team mates vali made a small smile im sorry act like you usually do dont apologise ketsuryuukou3 bikou says it while making a big laugh and smacking valis back stop it albion will cry hes already in a state where hes asking for a counsellor so albion also had his heart that torn huh so the reason
why albion was absolutely quiet back in the artificialdimension is because he didnt have any energy left in him sekiryuutei attracts the hearts of people hakuryuukou attracts the hearts of the exiled twoheavenly dragons you guys are heads and tails you guys are interesting heavenly dragonsthe first sun wukong leaves after saying that confirming that the first left i ask vali once again vali lucifer what are you going to do will you be satisfied if i say that i will take hyoudou isseis revenge kiba yuuto no i will just spit it out and say that its not like you and if there are those we have to seek revenge on then that is our job no i will take them down he smiles at my answer i see thats right i just want to release the power i couldnt to someone there are lots of people i am after and there are lots of people who are after me so it shouldnt be a problem vali showed a smile of a battlemaniac who doesnt feel like he will lose after asking the first about what i wanted to know at the room vali team is present in i
came out of the basement i was thinking of sending the opinion the first gave to a certain someone but yuutosan so you were here someone calls me from behind it is grayfiasama but she is not in the maid outfit she is usually in she tied her braided hair into one and she is wearing a battle costume which shows her body line i can understand what it means with one look she will be heading out as a servant of maou grayfiasama you are going to the front line grayfiasama nods at my question yes because of the holyspear lucifers servants and i will assault the monster jabberwocky who is progressing to the capital since sirzechs cant go out we will stop its movement at least if this person says that with confidence then i strongly feel that it will turn out like that other pursuit squads had attempted to freeze the gigantic monsters forceably teleporting them or creating a huge hole to seal their movements but all of them ended in failure i received information thatdemonic powers and magic relating to transport by force space and time wont work on them maybe those monsters were created with
a spell where such techniques wont work on them to be able to create such a terrifying thing just like i thought the possibilities annihilation maker has are very dangerous i can understand why the higherups placed it among the toptier longinus and discussed seriously about whether they should seal it away even so i start to think that the lucifer servants who are said to be the strongest among the devils can stop them my sword master is also in the lucifer group and he is a knight there is nothing he can not cut with his absolute technique can you give this to rias it is information from sirzechs and governorazazel from sirzechssamaand sensei grayfiasama handed me a memo with information on it this is knowing that it is rude i checked the memo which is for my master on it the words ajuka beelzebub and base written with devils letters the current location where the currentbeelzebub ajuka beelzebubsama is at i will also pass you on the message from govenorazazel have him look at ises evilpieces if its that man then he should be able to analyse whats left in the pieces go there with rias and
the others yuutosan ajukasama should be able to pick up any possibility yes this maou is the one who created the evilpiece system and he is the person i wanted to contact so sensei gathered information before hand he was concerned about us even though he is supposed to be the busiest person right now thank you very much sensei ajukasama will definitely tell us about any possibility grayfiasama then smiles i wont allow the person who will become my brotherinlaw to perish with something like this go and get the information of his safety and make rias stand on her feet again it is foolish for her to call herself the nextgeneration when a youth with power isnt even standing for the crisis of the underworldlife2 pal part 1 its late at night the six of us buchou akenosan asiasan konekochan ravelsan and i arrived at the location written on the memo grayfiasama gave us after that i told buchou about the things i learned and i was able to get her out of her room i also said what grayfiasama told me to the other members and i was somehow able to get them to come as well
everyone came here with me as if they were relying on a medicine this town is in the human world and is about 8 stations away by train from the town we live in an abandoned building located outside of town that was devoid of people they say that this is one of the hideouts of ajuka beelzebub in the human world i never imagined or sensed that he would have been here it wouldnt even be a funny joke if i was to estimate that person though we took a step inside the abandoned building the lobby in the first floor had lots of people it seemed like young males and females were talking with each other splitting into groups they arent devils thats because i dont sense even slight demonicpowers from them but i do feel something weird from them everyone here had an atmosphere that people with unique power have one of the groups realised we were present and they took out their mobile phones and directed them at us one of the men put on a serious face and got shocked those guys are devils and what is it with these insane levels and ranks with
his words everyone in this lobby took out their mobile phones and directed them at us everyone had their eyes dragged to their mobile phone monitor and they all had a serious expression they recognised that we are devils and from my judgment do those mobile phones have the function to measure certain powers then what came to my mind was the personality of ajuka beelzebub his hobbies i hear that that person creates games in the human world and manages the company are those mobile phones atool which have something to do with it i think they found out who we are by using it getting too much attention doesnt feel good we should leave here quickly and find ajuka beelzebubsama i dont think they will assault us when i felt that way a person with the same aura appears from the end of the lobby i am very sorry just like it says this is one of the lobbies which are part of the gaming industry a woman wearing a suit i can understand that she is different from the others she is a devil she points at one of the elevators after bowing her head down at
us this way ajukasama is waiting at the roof we arrived at the roof by using the elevator the place we were escorted to by the lady devil is a spacious garden on the rooftop its filled with plants not just grasses and flowers but there are also trees growing out theres also a water fountain maybe because it is late at night but the wind is cold only the moon is acting as light but for us devils we can see clearly on this rooftop the woman bows her head and then leaves then at the same time someone talked to us the gremory group never thought you would be coming as a group when i looked that way there was a seat and chair located in the middle of the garden there is one young man sitting on the chair a man with a mysterious atmosphere and beauty ajukasama buchou took a step forward and called the name of the man yes this person is ajuka beelzebubsama ajuka beelzebubsama speaks holding the teacup within his hand i heard the story seems like you were dragged into something serious no looks like its nothing new to your group your
group is famous for receiving assaults like that buchou walks towards ajukasama there is something i would like ajukasama to have a look atbuchou tries to take out isekuns evil pieces from her pocket hou something you want me to see but looks like that will have to happen afterwards ajukasama signals buchou to stop with his hands and then looks at the end of the garden looks like we have guests besides you with maousamas words we also realised their presence as well people besides us were present in this garden the ones that appeared from the darkness aredevils just like us never thought you would be in a place like this in the human world the impostor maou ajuka there are several men who have a tremendous amount of aura i can sense that they have the powers of highclass devils or higher they are quite skilled i also know who they are because they called ajuka beelzebubsama an imposter maou ajuka beelzebubsama makes a bitter smile i think its the charm of the oldmaou faction that it is easy to tell who you are just by hearing you speak once im also here i also heard a
familiar voice from the darkness the one who also appeared was the whitehaired youth siegfried khaos brigade he took a glance at us and looked at maousama once again seeing that there is something coming from within my body im trying hard to keep that down not yet i still cant i will release it afterwards the ones who killed him akenosan who is behind me has her killing intent even higher dangerous aura is coming out of her body her will to fight rose after knowing who the enemy is of course they are basically the ones who we have to seek revenge against for isekun the girls in the gremory group wont be dispirited and have their intent to kill down when the ones who are responsible are right in front of them only asiasan has tears flowing outwith regrets saying why did isesan have to get involved in the quarrel between the underworld governments asiasan i think he would jump into dangerous places if he finds out that the ones he loves and the children of the underworld are in danger that is the sekiryuutei hyoudou issei but this doesnt match up werent the oldmaou faction and
herofaction supposed to be enemies i am suspicious of this pairing first time meeting you ajuka beelzebub im siegfried from the herofaction and these gentlemen here are the staff from the previous maou faction who are cooperating with the herofaction ajuka beelzebubsama gets greeted by siegfried so there are oldmaou faction members who allied with the herofaction huh it really is a complicated organisation i know you you are a former warrior from the church correct siegfriedkun you had your name at the top ranking you were a threat to us before the alliance of the three big powers if i remember correctly your nickname is chaosedge sieg so what business do you have with me i already have guests as you can see i will hear your business then maousama questions quietly while folding his hands on the table apart from siegfried the devils from the oldmaou factions are flowing with an aura of hostility they are planning to attack if ajuka beelzebubsama says a single word that would disturb them though this person is still behaving with elegance when he understands the current situation this person has a different confidence from sirzechssama its about the thing we asked
you about before how about we make an alliance ajuka beelzebub all of us here became shocked i never expected the terrorists would come and ask for an alliance with the current beelzebub siegfried continues on even though you are part of the yondaimaou you have a different ideology compared to sirzechs lucifer and also have your own authority and your research relating to abnormal things surpasses others i hear that you can gather the same number of people as the ones that cooperate with sirzechsi have also heard those rumors the current maou government is split into 4 groups and each group is maintained by faction members of each maou the factions with most authority within the four groups are sirzechssamas faction and ajukasamas faction each faction is cooperating now to maintain the current government but for simple matters they are against each other and it comes up in the news from the broadcast they have mainly different views on technology organisation hearing siegfried ajuka beelzebubsama makes a sigh im certainly a maou and i move with my personal thoughts i have thrown away sirzechs requests numerous times from the sides it might look like im against sirzechs ideals
the game im currently working on is also part of my hobby siegfried makes a bitter smile at his words we got in serious trouble because of those hobbies judging from their conversation the game created by ajuka beelzebubsama is interfering with khaos brigades actions i can say the same to you when maousama said that siegfried shrugs his shoulders what attracts us the most about you is that you are the only devil who could compete against that sirzechs lucifer i hear that you and sirzechs lucifer are irregular devils who are envied greatly and feared by the descendants of previous maou if one of you joins us then we cant ask for anymore man power than that hearing siegfrieds opinion maousama put his hand under his chin he seemed a bit interested i see it might be interesting if i become a terrorist and oppose sirzechs seeing his shocked face might be worth it is he serious i cant tell what his intentions are but he looks very pleased we will also give you the information and research reports to you as well for someone like yourself who only makes new things i can guarantee that this report
will be something very worth your while ajuka beelzebubsama nods even more at siegfrieds sweet wordsi see the information and research reports khaos brigade has yes it certainly does seem charming i couldnt tell whether he was joking or being serious ajuka beelzebubsama closed his eyes once and then opened them then he clearly said but i dont need it to me the alliance with you does seem appealing but its something i have to decline siegfried didnt change his expression even though he was declined though the devils around him make their killing intent even higher siegfried asks i want to ask you the reason in detail but i will make it simple why not the reason why i can concentrate on my hobbies is because sirzechs considers all of my will as well he no i have had a long relationship with him hes the only one who i can call my friend thats why i know him better than anyone and he knows me better than anyone i only became a maou because he became a maou thats how sirzechs and my relationship goes ajuka beelzebubsama and sirzechssama have known each other for a long time in
other words they were rivals when they were young i think there are things only the two of them understand that thing is absolute to ajuka beelzebubsama and he easily rejected the offer of the terrorists siegfried nods without changing his expression i think he knew the answer he would have gotten from the beginning i see a friend is the reason you decline us and i cant understand that reason but i do understand that there are ways to decline like that siegfried makes a sarcastic smile the oldmaou faction devils become noisy thats why i told you this man this man and sirzechs control the underworld for their own purpose no matter how much technology he has brought to the underworld we can not let a maou who is addicted to playing around rule any longer now is the time to be eliminated annoying fraudulent existence we who have inherited the will of the true maou will eliminate you ajuka beelzebubsama smiles at the words of anger he has receivedphrases that i hear often are you people perhaps saying this to all the people related to the current government of the underworld words that are filled with anger
there isnt any elegance nor am i interested in them in other words i find you boring are you making a fool of us ajuka they are about to blow up no this would be the start of the battle they know our faces as well so we get ready for battle but ajuka beelzebubsama unfolds his hands which are on the top of the table he put one of his hands forward and creates a magiccircle i know that it is pointless to talk to you it cant be helped i will do my job as a maou which i havent been doing for a while i will eliminate you all dont fuck around the enraged devils from the oldmaou faction released huge amounts of demonicpowers at the same time its something which we will receive fatal wounds from if we were to be hit by them maousama doesnt even flinch and just controls the small magiccircle within his hand the devil words and formula move at very fast speed their attacks are about to hit and then the moment it was about to hit they all flew in different directions seeing that the devils from the oldmaou faction
are shocked ajuka beelzebubsama is still sitting on his chair like before you came here knowing about my ability right did you actually think that if it was your demonicpowers then it will work against me or are you shocked because it ended like this even though you powered up yourself either way its impossible for you guys the oldmaou faction guys are shocked at ajuka beelzebubsamas words this is just my guess but they must have strengthened themselves sirzechssama and ajuka beelzebubsama are heroes who have fought in the front line and were the aces of the antimaou faction both of their legacies are known throughout the underworld sirzechssama has the absolute power of destruction to terminate things ajuka beelzebubsama is said to have an absolute technique where he can control all phenomenon with just equations and formula ajuka beelzebubsama changed the directions of the opponents attack with his own demonic powers the faces on the devils from the oldmaou faction are that of those who are in fear ajuka beelzebubsama continues onfrom my point of view all the phenomenon and abilities that occur in this world have rules and laws in them i am able to get an
answer by filling in the equations i have liked calculations since i was a child thats why my demonicpowers became specialised in those areas look i can do things like this maousama looks up to the sky we and also the oldmaou faction devils who are in doubt also look up little by little a sound which is cutting through the wind is getting louder the thing which is coming from the sky is the demonicpower attacks which lost its directions the demonicpowers which start raining from the sky attack the devils one of them perishes without making a noise the ones who dodged them before they were hit are pursued by the demonicpowers which changed its direction they get shocked when they see their attacks coming after them so you have controlled our attacks i can also do this maousama moves the devil letters and equations in the small magic circle even faster that magiccircle must be customised and have an equation problem that can calculate the phenomenon the block of demonicpowers coming after them turn into many bullets while other ones get more simplified and start going after them for him to control and change the shape of
block of demonicpowers released by others and with a fast velocity all the attacks start going after them the speed also increases when it is going after them he can actually control other peoples powers like his own hands and he can even make it stronger ddaaaaamn yooooouuu they realised that they cant run away from it so they once again release an offensive aura from their hands from the quality of it it has the same power as the one they shot earlier no it is even more powerful but the attacks controlled by ajuka beelzebubsama easily break through theirattacks and pierce through their bodies demonicpowers that were split into many bullets created huge holes in their bodies he even increased the power of the attacks he gained control of he changes the direction of the attacks coming after him and he uses the formula to take control of it on top of that he can change the shape the velocity and the power of it so this is the power of this mans kankara formula to have this much power with moving only slightly how much power do you and sirzechs possess the devils from the oldmaou faction
say that and go down with the expression of having regrets so this is the power of ajuka beelzebub just like they said maousama stopped their assaults without showing his true powers after all that person hasnt gotten up from his chair his powers make me feel something beyond fear his opponents werent weak at all even so he eliminated them without making them do anything by only moving his hands i can understand why this person and sirzechssama are said to be in a different class among devils ajuka beelzebubsama then looks at the only one left siegfried now the only one left is seigfriedkun from the herofaction what will you do he just shrugs his shoulders i still have an ace up my sleeve so im thinking about retreating after using that i can feel something flowing within me when i saw siegfrieds smirk i think this is my fury ajuka beelzebubsama gets interested at siegfrieds words hou that truly interests me but he then looks at me the gremorys knightkun over there you have been giving off a nice killing intent towards him since before maousama has sensed my will to fight ajuka beelzebubsama says it to
siegfried while clicking his fingershow about you become his opponent by the looks of it you are acquainted with this person from the herofaction this building and roof garden are very sturdy it wont break down even if your attacks are done with great force i couldnt wish for more the truth is i cant control myself unless i release this feeling i have within me to someone i took a step forward yuuto buchou asks me with wonder at my actions buchou im going if you are going to fight alongside me then please take care of me i just told her that and continued walking forward while creating a single holydemonic sword in my hand isekun when i heard that you wont be returning what came to my mind was the thing you said to me hey kiba lets make a promise that if one of us dies we will fight for everyone else even harder to honour that loss on the day we were training isekun suddenly said that to me what are you saying we both will have to survive i replied like that i remember isekun made a big smile when he heard that he
then continued on like this i know i also dont have the slightest intention of dying even so we end up fighting strong foes there were battles where it wasnt weird for us to have died thats why we wont know what will happen from now thats why i thought we should make a promise now if that happens if one of us dies then we will fight for everyone even harder for that lossah i will repeat myself but i dont have any intention of dying i still havent taken the virginity of the woman i love also i will hate it if you die as well i will hate it if my pal dies yeah you are right i hate losing my pal isekun you always said that you would return safely but you didnt come back after losing you i tried to support the group in my own way thats because the girls knew that their hearts wouldnt last if they lost you thats why i thought i would keep my feelings inside me and act calmly thats because that was our promise but im at my limits i wont be able to keep my feelings down
if the opponent i truly detest is standing right in front of me thats because i lost my important friend because of their stupid plans my best friend the first friend i made after being born in this world they took him away from me i cant forgive them thats why isekun let me spit out my personal feelings i made a stance with my holydemonic sword and i see the sworn enemy with my eyes filled with hatred siegfried im sorry but im going to release this anger i have within me at you because of you people my dear friend became someone who cant return it is a pretty good reason for you to die having my killing intent directed at him siegfried smiles i can sense a pressure from you that never showed before interesting but it looks like i have quite a lot of ties with you gremory group i never imagined that i would meet you in a place like this well who cares now then lets settle this the closest knightkun friend of sekiryuutei four dragon arms appear from his back its his balance breaker he showed it without hesitation he draws all of
his demonicswords with his four hands having the dragonslayer sword within my hand i dashed from where i was standingi got closer to him instantly and did a single strike at him he easily blocked it with only one of his demonicswords impressive he has a grasp of my movements fighting for a long time will be to my disadvantage i need to finish it with dragonslayer quickly blocking my strike siegfried narrows his eyes and he appears to be thinking about something when i became in doubt he nods and then made a sigh if i fight you in this situation i cant avoid receiving a critical hit even if i win thats how much your skills have improved even if i beat you i will definitely lose my life if i receive an attack from rias gremory and himejima akeno it wont be a bad thing to run away from here now but if i were to run away against the gremory group without doing anything and also failing to negotiate with ajuka beelzebub then i wouldnt look good to my comrades and the people below me this certainly is a difficult situation i especially dont find it
amusing to be laughed at by hercules and jeanne siegfried complains by himself and he then searches within his pocket what he takes out is a pistol no it is a bit different judging from the sharp tip is it an injectiontype syringe siegfried then puts the needlepoint to his neck he then makes a sarcastic smile this is something that was completed with the help from the oldmaou shalba beelzebub in other words its a doping drug for the sacred gear that is so you are going to strengthen your sacred gear then he nods at my question so they have been researching for things like that huh i also know they experimented with ophiss snake by having it on the sacred gear and forcing out different types of traits siegfried then says it what will the result be if we were to inject ourselves with the blood of the truemaou who is the arch enemy in bible of god who created the sacred gears that was the theme of the research with quite a number of sacrifice and lots of data collected it was able to fuse between the sacred item and deep devilishnessblood of a maou and
someone who inherits the blood of truemaou they altered it and made an item that enhances the sacred gear was that their plan siegfried then looks at gram which he is holding onto naturally i should be able to defeat you with this demonicemperorsword gram unfortunately i am chosen by this sword but you can say that i am also cursed by it kiba yuuto you can understand what i mean right like he said i can understand what he meant why didnt siegfried use the ultimate demonicsword gram if it is like what the legend says the demonic emperor sword gram has incredible sharpness it covers itself with offensive aura its so sharp that it can cut through anything you can call it the demonicsword version of durandal the other trait is its dragonslayer this sword has slain one of the fivedragonkings gigantis dragon fafnirthough fafnir was later revived by the norse gods in other words it has the two traits which is a sharpness able to cut anything and also the dragonslayer that is demonicemperor sword gram to make it simpler it has the traits of durandal ascalon if we include these traits and also its owner siegfried
it truly is an irony siegfrieds sacred gear is a subspecies of twice critical its balancebreaker is also subspecies his sacred gear is said to be a dragontype sacred gear and just like the name implies it has the traits of a dragon he wont have a problem wielding gram if its twicecritical in basic state but it will be a different story if it is a balancebreaker which skyrockets his abilities the more he increases his abilities the more his relation with gram worsens the more siegfried releases his true ability the more harmful effects it has on him because of grams dragonslayer ability which will terminate siegfried himself the reason why isekun who is a sekiryuutei can put ascalon inside his gauntlet as if it is nothing is because of the help from the heavens and that his sacred gear is an exception even though siegfrieds sacred gear is a subspecies it is not an exception even though he was chosen by the ultimate demonicsword his ability wasnt blessed by the demonicemperor sword irony you can call it foul play by destinyright now in front of me there is a man who is being tested by the sacred
gear system created by the god from the bible sigfried then starts to spin around gram in balancebreaker state like this it is a good demonicsword with good balance if i completely shut down its offensive aura though if i do that i wont be able to release its full potential but if i release its powers i will receive fatal wounds by my own sword if i am in a balancebreaker state this sword here isnt concerned about its masters body if he was to use gram then it would be when he isnt in balancebreaker five demonicswordsincluding suppressing grams power one sword of light twicecritical balancebreaker and three demonicswords including gram with its full powertwicecritical base state in this situation and also back at the artificialdimension which one would be better to use against us the answer would be former yes if i want to fight using gram then i have to fight in my normal state but comparing with the balancebreaker sixswords style it wont cope with it and that becomes more obvious in a battle against you guys i wont be able to fight against you guys properly if i dont use balance breaker but it
will be a different story if i can use the demonicemperor sword gram while in balancebreaker siegfried injects the contents of the pistol into his neck there was a silence then siegfrieds body reacts his body starts to react even more and his body started to change michimichi while making a weird and dull sound the four arms growing from his back become thicker each of his fingers start to crumble and merge with the swords they are holding onto and siegfried himself starts to change his expression becomes hard and there are veins on his face his muscles start to move as if he is a different creature and the herofaction uniform he is wearing gets torn a monster who has four arms that became gigantic which can almost touch the ground he no longer looks like an asura he now looks like a spider monster and the enormous pressure and creepy aura isnt normal while having cramps on his face he smirkschaos drive thats what we call it we call this doping injection a chaos break we took the part of the name from balancebreaker and juggernautdrive a low and deep voice even his voice has changed marvelous
humans can create things which surpass devils and angels at times i really think that humans are the ones with the most potential ajuka beelzebubsama says that yes even though they are humans they can enhance things created by the god this much and they even use the blood and flesh of a maou i can understand why humans get abnormal powers humans make their desires evolve even more monster no siegfried who has turned into a demon takes a step forward that action alone changed the atmosphere of this rooftop garden and miasma is formed the twice critical which has four thick arms has merged with the demonicswords hes coming thats what i though and i moved forward rather than observing his attack the place i was standing before had whirlwinds ice pillars and a crack on the ground his combo attacks with each of his demonicswords if my judgment was even slightly slower my body would have been cut into pieces i sensed chills from ahead of me so i changed my holydemonic sword into holysword and materialised my knight troops i used them to jump up in the air then enormous amounts of aura went past by
the place i was standing before my knighttroops which i used as my stepping stone perished without a trace i looked at siegfried from up the sky he used gram so that is the strike of gram even though i dodged it the offensive aura pierced through me and i feel pain throughout my body if i get hit by that directly my body will perish completely he shot that aura out without charging his sword and it has the same destructive power as durandal no since it didnt have charging time it is more dangerous than durandali would like to be glad at the fact that it doesnt have the power of holy in it but with that much power in it i cant be relieved i dropped down on the rooftop and changed my holysword back to a holydemonic sword and closed my distance with him i released my slash at him from the sides but he easily blocked with one of his demonicswords sword techniques from each of his four arms have destructive powers and it would destroy my body easily if i receive the attacks head on the sword of light siegfried is holding with his
left hand is the only sword which isnt a holydemonic sword i can make it perish if i use a holydemonic sword which devours light but i wont be able to eliminate the five demonic swords that easily the sword fight between me and siegfried dragged on for a while i attack with highspeed leaving a mirage but he blocks it with his demonicswords his dragonarms became bigger so my target should have become much easier but even so he still blocks my attacks at times the gram which he is holding with his right hand is covered with dangerous aura when he slashes it towards me even if it doesnt hit me directly my body is damaged by grams offensive aura the waves of gram which didnt hit me continue to go past me the rooftop garden is turned into dry soil because of the violent waves from gram the reason why this building is still safe is because ajuka beelzebubsama used demonicpowers to strengthen this building if it was a normal building siegfrieds gram would have destroyed it numerous of times then five demonicswords came slashing towards me i dodged them while creating a holydemonic sword at the
tip of my foot and i use that to kick under his arm of course this is a dragonslayer sword if this hits him this situation will reverse it hit him thats what i thought but my holydemonic sword crumbled while making a sound of metal breaking down are you telling me that the hardness of his body surpasses that of my holydemonic sword seeing that siegfried makes a fearless smirk looks like my strengthened body surpasses that of your dragonslayer holydemonic swordsiegfried grabbed the foot i used to kick with and threw me up in the air a moment of floating i can imagine easily that his attacks will come after this i then get slammed to the ground his intense power slams me violently on the ground then a single swing of a demonicsword comes down at me i felt a heavy shock to my body and it feels like my whole body is getting crushed on the floor the shock pierces through me and it creates a crater on the floor i can hear the noises of cuts through out my body with intense pain which i cant describe with words i almost lose my consciousness i
threw up the thing coming up from inside my stomach lots of blood vomit came out from my mouth and it makes the green garden turn red with the shock of being slammed down and the strike from a single demonicsword the shivers on my body arent stopping now i have serious damage in every part of my body i can tell many of my bones are broken but i still cant lose yet i tried hard to keep myself conscious and i stood up and moved my legs after retreating from that position i fixed my stance and went slashing at him once again siegfried uses his two demonicswords to easily stop my attack by making a cross for someone like you who has a weak defence didnt the attack just now injure you quite a lot siegfried laughs with a deep voice well yes it has i dont have any strength in the hand im gripping onto my sword with while having his swords in a cross he pushes it against me my body flew backwards and my legs became wobbly a bit there isnt any strength in my legs at this rate i will go down i
gather all the strength in my body and move it to my legs the moment i thought my legs stopped shaking my legs get covered by ice damn it he froze me with his ice demonicsword i tried to melt down the ice by changing my sword into a fire holydemonic sword buttwo ice pillars which grew from the ground pierce through both my thighs siegfried then swings down another demonicsword at me i twitched my body because my legs were sealed and i create many holydemonicswords in front of me to use them as a shield but those holydemonic swords get destroyed and it completely cuts down my left arm from my shoulder even though he cut off my arm i used the fire holydemonic sword to melt down the ice and i jumped backwards from the wounds so much blood came out i changed my sword into a ice holydemonic sword and i froze the wounds on my shoulder and the holes on my thighs its only a temporary treatment but the blood should stop with this i can feel intense pain throughout my whole body i have holes on both my legs and i am kneeling down
on the floor pathetically my proud legs turned out like this yuuto buchou calls my name with a painful expression shes holding onto isekuns evilpieces with both her hands and it seems she is desperately waiting for something buchou even if you rely on isekun like that he cant come here you know what point is there if you dont stand up if you lose the will to fight it will affect the whole group because of that akenosan and konekochan are worryingly looking at me but they arent sure what to do everyone lost the will to fight because of losing isekun they only had intent to kill at the beginning but it didnt push them enough to fight theres no way we can save the underworld from its crisis in this situation sairaorg bael i just cant help but wish that if only i had charisma like isekun where i can deeply encourage everyone else kibasan is also going to die no i cant endure anymore of this asiasan became panicked and she points her hand at me she must be trying to send the aura of healing to me but what appears is a veryweak aura and
it seems like she cant emit her usual amount of aura most likely her sacred gear ability temporarily became weak as a shock from losing isekun i kind of predicted that since sacred gears operate with the power of feelings buchou and akenosan try to attack by shooting out demonicpowers but their outputs and powers are much weaker than their usual ones siegfried takes it down with a single strike with ease konekochans touki and ravelsans wing of fire are also weak it seems like the girls are also shocked about the fact that they cant release their power that much i have to protect them i have to protect everyone in isekuns place i took out a phoenix tear which i got from ruval phoenix and i put it on my wound the pain disappears instantly and the wounds are also covered but it obviously didnt regenerate my left arm i need to pick my arm which is lying over there afterwards and put it back on even though the wounds healed the amount of blood loss decreased my stamina a lot not much strength is left in my legs even if i tried to stand up my legs
just shivered this really does look pathetic my weakness that is defence huh siegfried sneers at this situation horrible i cant even think its the same gremory group i fought the other day you have been giving me good killing intents so i thought you guys were going to intrude in the fight between me and kiba yuuto and i was waiting for it but for you guys to be this bad no the truth is im also at my limits thats because isekun isnt next to me in front of me or even behind me when he had always been there before i never thought it would be this painful not to fight side by side with isekun if you were next to me then i wouldnt be kneeling down pathetically like this hyoudou issei died in vain he and shalba took each other down when he went to chase shalba who took ophis away and stayed in the dimension by himself right shalbas presence disappeared after that if he was alive he would have declared war against us and demonstrated the power of the oldmaou faction in the underworld if hyoudou issei ignored ophis and returned with you
guys then right about now he could have prepared and gone after shalba once again putting ophis aside he could have taken down shalba afterwards if hed done that not thinking ahead and acting was the bad part of sekiryuutei my mind became white when i heard siegfried say that and then my ill feelings were coming out from within me hyoudou issei died in vain he died in vain isekun did dont talk garbage dont mess around what was going through my heart was sorrow regret and the promise i made with him while my body is shivering i put strength in my legs and little by little i stood up while miserably shaking my legs i stood up i released the feeling i have within me which is coming upright to my throat ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i made a sound which even i couldnt believe it feels like something is coming from the depth of my stomach and my heart what passed through my mind was what my best friend said kiba we are the males of the gremory group yeah i know isekun so lets stand up even if something happens and fight alongside everyone yes we need to
stand up no matter who our opponent is not yetstep by step i got closer to siegfried while creating a holydemonic sword in my palm i can still fight i have to stand up just like that man hyoudou issei from the gremory group stood up no matter what and no matter who he was against without backing down if i go down here i wont be able to face isekun isnt that right isekun i wont be able to call myself your friend if i dont stand up here sekiryuutei isnt a man who you can speak ill about dont talk ill of my friend my yell which is mixed with my cry im really pathetic because only my words are strong its no use even if you try to become like that sekiryuutei you have your limits no matter how much talent you have you are just a reincarnated devil who was reborn from a human the damage you received will stop you from moving i know that my body has already reached its limit i dont even have the strength left to grip onto my sword properly but but isekun would still go ahead possess please possess
even if it is only a bit the spirit and willpower which drove that man hyoudou issei please reside in me it happened when i made a stance with my sword and was about to go ahead there was a red light coming from the side of my sight when i looked to that direction ises evilpieces are isekuns evilpieces that buchou is holding onto are emitting red lights one of the pawn pieces floats up in the air it glowed in red lights even more under the dark night that piece came flying towards me and the light gets even stronger i close my eyes for a slight moment because of the intensity but when i opened my eyes what is floating before me is a single holy sword ascalon isekuns evilpieceturned into ascalon lets go pal i thought i heard isekuns voice my tears start to flow from my eyesand they arent stopping you are such a softhearted person even though there are only the evilpieces left you still care for your comradesand me i took ascalon while covering my face with tears you are right isekun lets go with you by my side i can get even
stronger if you lend me your strength we can cut through anyone no matter the opponent the courage which is passing through to me from ascalon is real i can feel the same heartening that i had when i fought side by side with you yeah we can do this this is enough ican fight my legs stop shivering naturally and unbelievable vitality is coming from the depth of my body i put strength into the hand i am holding ascalon with and i went slashing towards siegfried he stops my strike with astonishment imposible you are telling me you can still stand losing that much blood should even stop your prideful legs from moving he told me to go he told me to stand if isekun tells me something reckless through this sword i have to go forward then an enormous amount of aura is released from ascalon the dragonslayer holy sword ascalon siegfrieds body changes with it weird smoke started coming out from his body he has a painful expression what is this poweri can feel from that holysword i see so ascalon is making this man suffer even though his body started to endure gram it means
isekuns ascalon is different i can do this it happened when i thought like that gram which siegfried is holding onto glows is he trying to do something i sensed danger so i tried to step back but that wasnt it gram is directing its radiance towards me that isnt a radiance of hostility but more like it is accepting me gram the demonicemperor sword is responding to kiba yuuto is this the demerit from the chaosbreaksiegfried gets shocked for him to act like this i see so gram has rechosen its ownerin a sudden situation like now i shouted towards gram directly come gram if you are choosing me then i shall accept you hearing gram glows even more that light burns the hand of its owner siegfried as if it is rejecting him gram flew up and it impaled the ground in front of me seeing that siegfried shakes his head and says it as if he cant believe what is happening something like this something like this can happen sekiryuutei can move even when hes only a chess piece you are telling me he can still fight he can make this man stand up even though gram
had chosen me i wont be able to wield it with only one hand when i thought like that someone approaches me its asiasan konekochan and ravelsan konekochan lifts my arm which was cut off and she put it towards the wound on my shoulder asiasan put her hand towards there and she emits lightgreen light and ravelsan supports my body receiving a gentle aura my arm started to reconnect and i started to get the feeling on my arm back asiasan konekochan and ravelsan are crying they have isekuns crimson evilpieces within their hands isesan said asia you also have to fight it feels like he said that through this piece asiasan smiles while trying to endure crying i think he said please help my pal to me as well konekochan also smiles i started to receive healing from her with her senjutsu both of their auras are gentle and filled with love i think i also heard it isesamas voice please help konekosan and the others seriously saying it to me who isnt part of this group hes too kind ravelsan says that and smiles after wiping off her tearsplease fight alongside everyone yes if its that person
he would definitely say that buchou steps forward while holding onto isekuns evilpieces even though her eyes are wet with tears i can see strength inside themnow my adorable servants lets blow away the enemy before us as the gremory group she returned buchous usual speaking manners yeah isekun she has returned we can fight we can definitely fightanywhere and anyone thanks to asiasan my arm which was cut off is reconnected and i pulled out gram from the ground which is in front of me i can feel enormous power from it so this the ultimate demonicsword demonicemperor sword gram if i use the dragonslayer of this sword and the dragonslayer of ascalon at the same time siegfrieds body cant endure it no matter how hard its become i made a stance with both swords and put strength in my legs spirit came back to my legs that i am proud of no lets fight once again but it will be different from before its not just me but this time it will be the gremory team buchou asiasan konekochan and ravelsan look sharply at siegfried buchou released a huge block of power of destruction from her hand i
went forward at the same time as well not yet even so im a descendant of a hero a light flashed on top of siegfried who was just speaking then enormous holylightning came down from the night sky at him along with his surroundings when i look up i saw akenosan up in the air she was spreading her six fallenangel wings her appearance having multiple wings made her look like a toptier fallenangel this is my last resort fallenangel transformation i made my blood of holylightning denser by asking father and azazel what is shining on both akenosans wrist is a bracelet with magical symbols written on it the magical symbols are popping up with golden light those enhanced akenosan no it must have awakened her fallenangel powers she already had i think azazelsensei and barakielsan are involved with that bracelet im sorry ise please show your usual smile to everyone i was about to discardthe feelings you left behind im okay now i can also fight nowakenosan says that with determined eyes thats good with this the two great oneesama that isekun and we admired have returned siegfrieds whole body is burnt after receiving a full blow of
lightning there is smoke coming out from various parts of his body what intense power that holylightning had to give that much damage to siegfried whose body hardened a lot with the drug it must mean the power of akenosans holylightning increased after that buchous power of destruction which she shot earlier went at him all of his dragon arms which had become thicker and larger perish now this is the finishing blow siegfried stab the holysword ascalon and demonicsword gram that i am holding onto impale siegfrieds body siegfried throws up loads of blood iam being defeated he pats softly on gram which betrayed him the demonicsword burns his hand as if it rejected him he laughs at himself seeing that we won isekun i pulled out the two swords from siegfrieds body after saying that there is no more blood coming out of his body receiving two dragonslayers his body starts to crumble there are cracks throughout his body and eventually it started to crumble that spreads throughout his body while crumbling he narrows his eyes and laughs quietly hahahyoudou issei continues to fight even if killed he looks at me and my comrades there are cracks on
his face now why dont you use the phoenix tear the herofaction can get their hands on it from their own connections right i question him in the battle at kyoto they used phoenix tears it wont be weird if they have it but he shows no sign of using it while his body is crumbling i felt suspicious siegfried shakes his head in this state our bodies cant be healed by pheonix tears though the reason for it is still unknownso there was such a demerit like that for this enhancement i think this information is important i knew it the warrior from the church who was raised in that warrior institutecant have a proper life saying that his body crumbles and he disappeared part 2 we who defeated the oldmaou faction members and siegfried buchou made ajuka beelzebubsama look at isekuns evil pieces the pawn piece which turned into ascalon reverted back to an evilpiece as if it had fulfilled its role something that isekun left in his pieces and the remaining aura of ascalon responded to our feelings and it might have made a change like that perhaps thats what ajuka beelzebub said whatever it is things
which we and he could only understand made a phenomenon like that occur the truth that he is always with us made me very happy there is a chess board on top of the table maousama put isekuns eight evilpieces on the spot where pawns are positioned he activated a small magic circle and it seems like he is checking inside the pieces after a moment ajuka beelzebubsama made a sigh of amazement hou this is did you find out anything when buchou asks maousama touches isekuns evil piece out of the eight four of the evil pieces have turned into mutation pieces though there are different values on each of them this is indeed interesting the triaina and crimson armour must represent these the combination power of heavenlydragon and evilpieces the harmony spec surpasses that which one can imagine it was worth checking him back then the phenomenon earlier was indeed interesting is his will directly reflecting on the evilpieces for four out of the eight pieces to be changed into a mutation piece when isekun was reincarnated the pawn pieces used were all regular pawn pieces the only mutation piece buchou had was used ongasperkun its truly amazing
that his evilpieces went through a change like that inside him this is also the secret factor that ajuka beelzebubsama hid inside the evilpieces from the beginning i also think the breastpower has got something to do with it as well after all this is isekun we are talking about so did you find anything else from the evilpieces buchou asks once again including me everyone in our group and ravelsan have our ears opened at ajuka beelzebubsama maousama then says it clearly what i can answer you from these evilpieces is this i dont know what kind of situation he is in but the possibility of him being alive in the dimensional gap is high also the sekiryuutei ddraigs spirit remains as his sacred gear so hyoudou issei and boosted gear are still together and these evilpieces havent stopped functioning and could be used again though since these evilpieces are recorded with him they can only be used on him no it will be more appropriate to say that you can put them back in hyoudou issei feelings which i cant describe with words run through my body everyone became speechless and maousama continues his explanation the vessel that
these evilpieces have accepted so it means that his soul and body are in an unstable condition and that is certain if he received samaels curse then his body wont be safe i can confirm that from these evilpieces but the soul which should be receiving the curse after that seems like it hasnt perished after examining once the body is destroyed the soul should receive the poison right away these evilpieces are telling me that the soul was still safe after a certain time when his body was destroyed and when it should have perished its hard to grasp the situation with only his soul but i heard from governorazazels side that ophis is together with him so it wont be weird if anything happens no matter in what shape even if only his soul is alive even if the soul is safe what should we do abouthis body which has been destroyedi ask ajuka beelzebubsama fumu are his parents still alive or it can be anything like his body hair or dna information which could be found in his room his parents are alive i think we can find his body hair in his room if we search
for it then after his soul returns it is necessary to have enough dna from his parents or his body hair so we can recreate his new body which is close to his original the research institute which is managed by grigori should be able to do that just recreating his body is possible by using the clone technique that is so there is another problem buchou questions him like that maousama nods and continues the point about whether his soul can adjust to his new body and whether his new body can accept his sacred gear the boosted gear these two points are the problem for the first one even if his soul doesnt adjust we can use medicine or demonicpowers or magics to somehow fix it but he might need treatment for the rest of his life but the biggest problem is the second one sacred gears are delicate especially the longinus the fallenangels have proved the technique of taking out the sacred gear and transfer it but we cant tell about the after effects it will have when we transfer the boosted gear to the new body anyway he is able to live as your servant once
again when you adjust his soul to a new body and use the evilpieces again well if the evilpieces make a rejection reaction no need to worry because i can adjust it it was fortunate that the evilpieces didnt receive samaels curse i heard about that before its possible to transfer sacred gears the fallenangel raynare who took out the sacred gears from asiasan and transferred it to herself is one of the cases like that but azazelsensei also said this its possible to transfer it but there is a very high chance to lose other abilities so it means even if isekun gains a new body and has his soul and sacred gear put in it we cant throw away the chances of his after treatment and ability loss if the evilpieces havent stopped functioning and if his soul and sacred gear are still present then it is possible to revive him in other words ifthey were to disappear then we wouldnt have any method to revive him but hes still with his sacred gear oh yes there was the case with regulus nemea as well maybe like that the sacred gear itself remained and his soul is inside
it if his soul is in the boosted gear he can endure for quite some time in the dimensional gap i hear that longinus of this generation are making irregular evolution so his luck must be the part of it a case which never happened before but we can say that he has strong luck at this answer i we ueeeeeeeeeeeen isesaaaaaan asiasan cries very loudly that isnt a cry of sadness but of joy akenosan konekochan and ravelsan are also shedding huge tears inside the despair we found a single light no it feels like we got a huge hope yes if there is a possibility of him being alive then he must be alive the reason for that is hyoudou issei is the man who made many miracles happen under any situation and that is everyones oppai dragon everyone here knows that better than anyone buchou covers her face with both her hands and she shed a tear of joy ise so you are alive yes there is no way he would die there is a possibility that ophis is next to him if isekun is alive then its natural that ophis is with him like ajuka beelzebubsama
said it wont be weird if anything happens if ddraig is also next to him then there is no more heart support than that maousama finishes looking at the evilpieces and returns them to buchou in any case this is something you should hold on to rias gremory you should rest assured your lover is the oppaidragon who makes miracles occur maybe his soul might return by itself with ophis and sekiryuutei ddraigs powers i will have people check the dimensional gap there should have been someone in falbiums servants who knows a lot about this stuff when ajuka beelzebubsama put his hand forward a transport magic circle is created in front of us all of you should get going the underworld is in need of the powers of the young devils dont be scared he will come back i think all of you know that the most he is a devil like that isnt heyes it is exactly like what ajuka beelzebubsama said if he is alive then he will definitely return even if anything happens as long as he is alive he will definitely come back to us no one in here doubted that isekun we will be
waiting thats why please come back the underworld the children of the underworld are waiting for your returndimensional gap una was i sleeping the place i hyoudou issei woke up is on top of red ground i saw a weird dream a dream where i was encouraging kiba who was fighting against siegfried he seemed like he was in trouble so i think i lent him ascalon the others also didnt look happy so i encouraged them as well huh where is this place when i looked around there were red rocks that arespiky is it a desert im not sure but im on top of red ground when i look at the sky the scenery is mixed up because it has a mixture of different colours it feels like im looking through a kaleidoscope wait is this hell if i remember i went after shalba who took ophis and i tried to save her and then what happened i was trying to go home i beat shalba andhuh did i get beaten instead my memories are blurry did you open your eyes i didnt know what was going to happen to you i can hear my partners voice ddraig
yeah i lost consciousness andhuh weird somehow my body feels weird i realised the change in my body weird i dont have any sense of touch i dont have the sense of touching anything im wearing the armour right now but i dont have the sense to feel that what is going on i tried to put my mask back into my armour like i usually do and i cant do it ththen how about this i made the armour on only my hands disappear then hands i dont have my hands my arm which is supposed to be inside when i take my armour off isnt there wwait are you telling me its the same with my whole body i didnt know what was happening to me and then ddraig talked to me your body was destroyed with samaels curse you are in a state where your soul was taken out of your body and put into the armour you can say that just your soul is left but it was a hard decision whether this was actually possible or not ehmy body was destroyed is a state where im just a soul and you put that inside the
armour i thought about it and i realise right away what this means how can this be if i dont have my body i cant have sex with riaaaaaas i screamed while holding down my head holy shit i cant touch any oppai if i dont have my body none of riass and akenosans oppai and asias oppai which is still developing you must be kidding me that i cant touch them anymore i started a relationship with rias at this rate i cant have sex with her eh tthats your reaction my partner made a dumb response then i told him its not eh this is a matter of life and death i got into a relationship with rias but i cant do erotic stuff without my body touch those breasts with my hands with bare hands i cant grope them it was better if i dieeeed how are you telling me to have sex with just my armour dullahan is the only one who can do such weird play not just rias i still havent touched enough of akenosans oppai either asias and konekochans oppais are getting started right now you know just looking at them is the
worst thing that can happen maybe it might not be bad if they go inside my armour and say aaaah ises inside is so cold that im feeling it no that isnt good i want to feel them with my own skin you are telling me i cant make babies with xenovia anymore shit i also wanted to make babies with irina geez i dont care if i can only do armour sex now god damn it so it should be okay if i can feel oppai with my armour right ah ummm you know partner ddraig made an amazed voice what is it im in a shock right now because i lost my body what else can there be what is it ddraig im really depressed right now talk to me afterwards shiiiit i thought i was going to go home after beating that fraud maoushalba ah where is ophis anyway i remained in the artificial dimension to save her yes ophis i regained my memory i did beat shalba afterall i then saved ophis and was going back home and i went down after my body was at its limit after taking samaels curse and when i regained
consciousness i was on top of red ground and have lost my body i look around finding ophis hit hit hit when i got close to her ophis says thisi shall defeat great red he wwhat are you saying then i realised it where i am standing that is i thought they were rough looking rocks but i ran on top of the red ground it wasnt that large and soon i found the end but what i found was an enormous sharp thing no this isnt this is a horn i walk a bit more and i appeared on top of the head of something im on top of a familiar creature yes this red ground is a gigantic dragon great red uwaaaaaaah im on top of great red wwhy am i on top of great red ddraig says it while making a sigh after you defeated shalba beelzebub you used up all your strength in the artificial dimension which was crumbling after that the artificial dimension collapsed completely great red passed by coincidentally then ophis rode on great red while taking you with her this is the dimensional gap by the way several days have passed since then
so now its like this huh to meet great red by chance i am really lucky so this is the dimensional gap it is a mysterious place wait several days have passed ah man everyone must be really worried thinking about how you attract others i can only think that you attracted great red naturally your chance of meeting legendary beings is already abnormal to avoid danger by your power of attracting others you are very hard to read like usual dont say that im also concerned about this i just want to have an ecchi life peacefully and so why do weird things like these come to me its more than serious this is a very dangerous thing i did lose my body after all maybe i should get purified ah i will receive damage if i get purified i cant do anything about itwell nothing will start if i say that now anyway im fine with great red coincidently passing by and being saved ophis stopped hitting great red and looked up at the sky what you didnt return to your world i say it to ophis it wouldnt have been weird if she went home leaving me
behind to me this is my original world oh yeah this dimensional gap is her motherland i said it in a wrong way didnt you return to the underworld or human world you said lets go home together thats why i am here i will go home together what an honest dragongodsama she really isnt bad shes pure you really are weird but you werent bad after all haaa by the way am i able to go home wasnt there a summoning by sensei there was but only your evilpieces inside you returned it was a rare phenomenon evilpieces are items with lots of mysteries ddraig says that there was a summoning but just my evilpieces returned are you serious ah it is true i cant feel the response of my evilpieces this makes me feel down seriously even though my soul was saved i lost my body and evilpieces what remained was my soul sacred gear and ddraig so i am in a state where it is amazing that i am alive no even being alive in this state is more amazing seriously what am i are you telling me this is the blessing of chichigamisama your power source
was because of the evil pieces right partner that is right ddraig triaina and truequeen were possible because of the evilpieces because of that i was able to get different powers from the previous sekiryuuteisanyway i need to tell everyone that i am safethough i am actually not wwell i want to tell them that im at least alive but am i safe staying like this the inside of my armour is empty can i call myself alive oh i am i do have my conscious you are borrowing great reds power right now so for now you are ddraig answers tthen that means i have to be with great red either way i cant return normally man im totally trapped can i change back the subject again partner ddraig says that nn was there something yeah reconfirmation of the current situation current situation you say i have to go on a trip in the dimensional gap with great red in this state right you are telling me to live in a world where there arent any girls breasts butts and thighs for eternity right its hell my road to becoming a haremking is far away hahahaha not giving up
on becoming a haremking even in this situation as to be expected from my partner ddraig laughs heartily this isnt something you can laugh about this is very serious for me its my dream the truth is it will be hard to become a haremking now since i dont have my body anymore no i have to think of ways to do erotic stuff with just my armour as my last resort thats it i can understand why the remaining thoughts of the past hosts left everything in your care what are you saying what do you mean i then send my conscious to the depth of sacred gear i can see that white world there are tables and chairs but noone is there there isnt even a single senpai there what is the meaning of this ddraig speaks quietly partner your soul was at risk of disappearing because of samaels poison it was too late for your body so we had to discard it what would beaffected after the body was your soul at that rate your soul was about to be eliminated by samaels poison even i thought there was no way out i was even prepared to
go to the next host wait so how did my soul survive their remaining thoughts protected your soul from samaels curse while they became your substitute for receiving samaels curse i pulled your soul out and attached it to the armour it was perfect timing if my judgement was slightly slow you wouldnt have been here now what then that means im here thanks to the senpais still havent i barely talked to them they started to put on good smiles by being released from the curse of sekiryuutei they even gave me advice at the artificial dimension i even thought we could get along from now on as well this a farewell like this is too much i can understand how you feel thats why can you please listen to their last words they left their words behind this is their last message to you yeah please let me hear it the words they left behind for me waiti think there was a similar situation like this beforea bad prediction crossed my mind then a vision appears from the jewel it has the recording of the faces of my senpais they said it to me with very refreshing smiles
pochi and pochi zoom zoom iyaaaan there was nothing i could say its just like how i imagined i knew it would turn up like this how much do you guys the past sekiryuutei love that song from the side of the vision hakuryuukousenpai shows his smile butts are also wonderful currentsekiryuutei tell that to vaaaaaaaaaaali ah the vision disappeared are you serious this is it nmoooooooooooou how come you senpais arent leaving any nice words to your kouhai4 the only thing i can say to them is thank you verymuch i will do my best while holding down my head no im really grateful at them for saving my life so make it more emotional then i made a sigh and ddraig says it to me look at the far end to the left i looked after ddraig said that there is a swollen block of flesh did great red get bitten by a mosquito ah it has a pulse is something inside whats that that is a cocoon no you can say that is a cultivation capsule cocoon cultivation whats inside yeah your body your body which has been destroyed once is receiving new flesh in there its
giving birth to your new body with a part of great reds flesh and ophiss powers what did you say i was speechless and ddraig laughed heartily kukuku you will be revived by the truedragon and dragongod partner lets prepare for the counterattacksatan realm of the dead located in the lower strata of the underworld and the place where the souls of the dead are sorted i azazel am visiting it the realm of the dead is of the olympus worldthe god from the greekfaction hades is in control of it it isnt as big as the underworld and its the world of the dead it is a wasteland that no creature can live on an ancient greek shrine appears as i move to the depths it is the place where the grim reapers of this world live as well as the castle of hades the hades shrine i step foot in it along with several people the moment we entered the grim reapers gathered and looked at us with hostility we came here without any call so to them it must appear like an attack the reason we came here is simple its to make a complaint to that
bastard hades and to stop that skeletongeezer from doing whatever he wishes to the underworld during the current crisis its that shit who is obsessed with pestering the devils and fallenangels he must be plotting to intrude at the right time while the gigantic monsters of annihilation maker are rampaging in the underworld so we also came here to make sure he doesnt do anything funny the place we arrived in is something that looks like a ritual area ornaments such as gold are used for the interior and its so gorgeous that it doesnt suit being in the underworld there is a carving on the wall of the trinity gods of olympus zeus poseidon and hades and it is carved to stand out then from the depths of the shrine a skeletonsama wearing vestments worn by priests hades approaches while bringing several grim reapers with him he sure has a disgusting aura around him the grim reapers who are with him seem to be quite formidable as well judging from the aura they are leaking they must be either toplevel grim reapers or ultimatelevel grim reapers though the ultimatelevel grim reaper from the other day pluto isnt here so
that is bugging me seeing hades the man next to me takes a step forwardit has been a while it is i maoulucifer from the underworld sirzechs at your service the god of the realm of the dead hadessama im very sorry for the sudden visit yes one of the members who came with me is sirzechs after i returned from the artificial dimension i told everything to this guy including about ophis and ise i know i wasnt in a position to be forgiven but i still said im sorry to sirzechs this guy listened to my details without changing his expression silently he didnt even blame me for it i was even prepared to get hit by you for making rias and ise end up like that thats how many sins i have committed after ordering his subordinates as countermeasure for the gigantic monsters which are progressing and the oldmaou faction members who are rampaging at each area sirzechs said this to me im planning to go to the realm of the dead i want you to come with me sirzechs predicted that hades would make his move during this chaos how should we handle hades who wont
even listen to us the answer for that is for the maou himself to visit hades and i also received new information regarding ise just before i also told sirzechs sirzechs was also relieved he must have been very worried eitherway if ophis is with him and ddraig is also safe he can comeback somehow he is the invincible oppai dragonsama after all the devil side has also started searching in the dimensional gap so sooner or later he will come back whats left is to make a new body for him putting his soul aside im not sure if putting back his sacred gear will work smoothly i just want to change him back with minimal negative factors hades laughs for you all to come here fafafafa i certainly didnt expect this though it seems you are pretty confident his strength is the real deal though he knows that he can beat us even if he were to fight against me and sirzechs michael also said he wanted to come with us but i stopped him because having the angelelder stepping foot in hell is a bit of a problem hades then looks at the person behind us so
who is that fake angel over there i can feel an abnormal presence from himthe one standing behind us is a youth wearing the robe of a priest and he has blonde hair and green eyes from his back 10 purewhite wings are growing out the youth made a simple introduction hello my name is dulio gesualdo brave saints joker im here as a guard for lucifersama and azazelsama though it doesnt seem like they need it though michaelsama said just in case its a job of an angel a job he seems very light hearted just like the rumours the weirdo joker dulio the possessor of zenith tempest and a brave saint who controls the sky the rumored trump card of the heavens huh i hear that the longinus within you can freely control the weather of the world fafafafa that michael i never expected him to send his joker here thats how much of a threat you are also outside the possessor of longinus canis lykaon that i brought here is on standby just in case something happens the bosses of the bats and crows and two longinuses dont you think its a bit of a bullying to
bring such people to an old guy like me look whos talking you have the power to take us even with these members so slash dog who is stationed outside is already known to him to be expected from godsama of the realm of the dead it might not be bad to talk to all of you while drinking tea but i will ask you what business do you have here you already know why how much do you have to irritate us to satisfy yourself sirzechs answers normally a few days ago there was an incident at the underworld which took place at the territory of glaysalabolas my sister her servants and azazel over here received an assault from the khaosbrigade at the hotel near the midclass devil promotion stadium ah that i have received the report about it and i heard that the governor and others were attacked by the grim reapersi heard that your sister and azazeldono were trying to get in touch with the uroboros ophis secretly so i had them investigate it all of the factions are thinking of having an alliance after all the relationship between the whole factions will crumble if there is
such treason like that and it will be even worse if this action was done by governor azazel who talks about peace more than anyone else so i wanted to know what is going through the mind of the governor i admire so i had my underlings look into it i told them to give you a small warning if such treason did happen hades explains while putting words of respect now and then in his speech his words make me feel ill i really want to pierce this guys neck with my spear of light this shit he said the things pluto was saying was a joke you are telling me that was the small warning you send that many grim reapers and also a legendary grim reaper he continues while touching his chin which doesnt have any flesh though it seems like it was my misunderstanding if you received any casualties then i will apologise if you want atonement then tell me i can grant you basically anything except my life speaking manners and attitude where he is talking down at us he must be doing it on purpose but it certainly is working to piss me off
since i was at that scene my anger is rising but there is a reason why i am not getting dragged into his words thats because there is someone here giving out intense pressure i never knew your calm expression would be this scary sirzechs you usually dont let me sense any of your aura at all but i can sense lots of aura coming from you listening to hades sirzechs nods once is that so so it was your misunderstanding i see i also came here because ive heard a rumour which doesnt sound that good you are getting into the main point aye sirzechs sirzechs questions once again hadessama i received a report that you are connected with khaosbrigade behind the scenes i hear that you are helping the herofaction and oldmaou faction i also heard that they used samael if this is true then your actions will be seen as a serious treason even if we are standing in different positions all the factions agreed not to have thatcome out i dont want to question your innocence but just for confirmation will you let us see how is the situation of the seal of samael we can
find out whether hades used samael by checking how long the seal has been used to seal samael if he is innocent then the seal should have been performed a very long time ago if he is guilty then the seal should have been undone recently if we can confirm that then we will get a reason to blame him it seemed like hades made a sigh at sirzechss question this is idiotic i am busy i dont have time to be accused of such things hades tries to leave just saying that hey hey hey this bastard ignores things which put him in a bad situation i try to go after him but sirzechs stops me with his hand i understand then i will stop questioning you but it is the truth that you are being accused so lets do one thing then i would like you to stay with us here until the monsters incidents settle in the underworld sirzechs makes a suggestion to make hades stay here an idea to have hades under the surveillence of the maou himself so hades wont be able to interfere with the underworld this is our last resort though we knew
it would come to this from the beginning i also suggested we seal hadess shrine until all the monsters are eliminated but sirzechs said that he wants to talk with him instead its not that he cant endure things but this is sirzechss kind personality which makes him do things to make casualties as low as possible hades stops and turns around you say something interesting lad yes how about this then i wont mind accepting that suggestion if your show me your true form i became speechless for a moment at hadess words this shittybastard came down to this huh hades continuesi heard rumours about it the reason why the devil named sirzechs became a being that is called lucifer the reason for which you have surpassed the beings called devils a moment of silence sirzechs nods very well if it will make you stay here then that is a very cheap deal but i suggest to have those around you back off they will definitely perish hou that would be interesting the ones around me arent only highlevel grim reapers but there are also ultimateclass grim reapers within them even so i dont think there are lies within
your words at sirzechs words the grim reapers around hades have even stronger hostility sirzechs takes his shirt off and tells me and dulio to back away are you really going to do it sirzechs while me and dulio watch sirzechs increases his demonic powers the demonic power of destruction emits from his body and his body starts to turn red then the whole shrine started to shake it must have shook because of sirzechss demonic powers this proves that the shrine which is made very solid is screeching violent cracks are made everywhere within the ritual area and that includes ceiling walls and the ground from these shakes not only the shrine but is the whole area around here shaking with sirzechss demonic powers sirzechss surroundings perish without leaving a single speck of dust due to the power of destruction emitting from him the moment a crimson aura envelops sirzechs the intense aura envelops this whole area the shaking stops then there was silence within the shrine what appeared in the middle was power of destruction in the shape of a human the new form of power of destruction looks at hades in this form the power of destruction
spreads without my command without any barrier of field it will make everything go back to nothingness it was fortunate that this shrine was made very strong it seems like this place will last longerthe new form of the power of destruction is none other than sirzechs himself so this is the true form of sirzechs are you telling me that insane quantity of power of destruction compressed itself into the form of a human but the quantity of aura i can feel with my skin from the amount of aura i can feel right now isnt it ten times more than that of the former lucifer when i was at the gremory residence sirzechs father current head of gremory said this to me governor azazel sometimes i wonder and think that my son is a different being to a devil and i sometimes wonder if it is okay to classify him as a devil that time i asked him by saying what do you mean by that the current head then said this while narrowing his eyes there is no doubt that he is a mutation of a devil why did that happen is there something in my blood
or is it a special trait inside the blood of bael we dont know anything about it except it is certain that sirzechs and ajuka are the only superdevils within the current underworld maybe it was their destiny to become a maou after all there wasnt any other position which would fit them thats how powerful sirzechs is i now know what you mean lordgremory i can understand why sirzechs was an ace in the battle against the formermaou government if someone like him who has unreal demonicpower is present then the sides will overturn and there were two devils with unreal powers sirzechs and ajuka it must have been natural that the antimaou faction at that time won though there is one more devil who you can call a superdevil though though he hid himself somewhere if he comes out then that will be very dangerous hahahaha looks like he doesnt need a guard behind me the joker dulio was making a sarcastic laugh yeah it will be natural to feel that way when you see this does this satisfy you hadesdonohades makes a laugh at sirzechss words fafafafa you monster i see you have greatly surpassed the former
lucifer you even greatly outclass the category of a maou no i can feel powers which make me doubt if i can even call you a devil what are you thats what i would like to know though its certain that it is a sudden mutation either way the current me can eliminate you fafafa doesnt sound like a joke at all if we fight then the realm of the dead will definitely perish yeah if it is the current sirzechs then that wont be a joke this miscalculation makes me very happy at worst i thought we had to handle hades by force but the current sirzechss power can accomplish that with ease geez ise and rias your brother is insane one grim reaper approaches hades the grim reaper whispers something to him hades who has received a report points his hands towards the fire positioned in the ritual area a vision appears within the fire what appears on the vision was a certain group rampaging against a very large army of grim reapers ora ora ora how much can you endure against my rod grim reaperssan its bikou who is spinning around his nyouibouruyi bang next to him
a gigantic golem gogmagog is blowing away an army of grim reaper with its gigantic arms then one of its arm turns into a machine gun i also saw kurokas and le fays magic attacks arthur is wielding his holyking sword and he eliminates hundreds of grim reapers the one who is moving in godspeed and tearing the grim reapers is fenrir its the vali team they showed themselves in the realm of the dead and started a battle against the grim reapers yeah i kinda knew this would happen theres no way they will stay quiet after being beaten if they were to seek revenge then they would be picking the herofaction oldmaou faction or hades as their prey they sure came at a good time ive never contacted them nor made a plan with them but good job dumbasses also the existence of fenrir who has the fangs that kill gods would also contribute to this matterthough i dont see vali in there since it is him he should be planning something is this your doing governor of crows hades asks with a very unpleasant voice yeah thats the reaction i wanted to see i wanted to see
that side of you i couldnt control myself and i said this to him while putting on a grin huh no idea the aura around hades changed colour to that of anger oh oh you seem to be quite pissed you will get yourself hurt if you look down on the vali team who are fully powered skeletonsama they are a gathering of monsters who have been fending off pursuits from all the factions you wouldnt be able to take down the members of the vali team unless you send all of your grim reapers you probably have to stay here and order them around to do so with this hades wont be able to interfere during the underworlds crisis he has no time to do nasty things to the underworld when the valiteam is rampaging in the realm of the dead and also when sirzechs is serious sirzechs agrees to my word yes thats why we can only have you remain here sirzechs lifts one of his fingers up one thing this is just my personal feeling thats why allow me to say it the personification of power of destruction glares at the god of the realm of the
dead with sharp eyes a hostility given by his glares makes your whole body freeze the god of the realm of the dead hades the evilintentions directed towards my sister rias and my brotherinlaw hyoudou issei will require your death i will have you prepared when we end up fighting i will eliminate you from this world and i will not hold back nor hesitate if there is one mistake hades made then that was to make this man furious no actually there are two mistakes i also grab a spear of light with my handskeleton godsama dont forget that im also pissed well its also my personal hatred towards you but let me say it dont make my students cry even while receiving our hostility directed at him hades doesnt show any sign of changing his presence well with this weve accomplished the case with hades i will leave the rest to you young devils now also come back already ise you will lose all the spotlight you knowlife1 alliance of young devils part 1 we the gremory group have returned from ajuka beelzebubs hideout and are in the gremory castle preparing to head out towards the capital after
a short time we reunite with irinasan and xenovia sorry we came late both of them are wearing their usual battle clothes xenovia is holding a weapon wrapped in a cloth the cloth is engraved with magical letters as well as the letters from heaven the weapon inside the cloth must be exdurandal which has just been repaired irinasan also has a new weapon on her hip i can sense a strong and abnormal aura from it it is most likely the result of the research the heavens were conducting that azazelsensei mentioned earlier buchou how is ise i heard most of the details from the people working here what did the maou beelzebub say yes he said ise isnt in the worst case scenario ophis and ddraig are with him so i want to contact him somehow yes well if it is him he will return as long as he is alive right about now he is probably yearning for buchou and fukubuchous breasts xenovia also believes in isekuns return but for him to be yearning for their breasts yes that seems very likely so what are we going to do now this time irinasan asks buchou buchou turns
on the large screen television what appears on the screen are the gigantic monsters that are rampaging in each capital of the underworld judging from the amount of time that has passed it wouldnt be weird for the monsters to have already arrived at the important locations but what appeared on the screens were devils and alliances from other factions putting up a good fight against the bandersnatch the reporter reports about it happily from a helicopter one of the bandersnatch is receiving critical damage from the warriors who came from the alliances several hours have passed since ajukabeelzebubsama developed the method of taking down the monsters and the battles are starting to overturn antimonsters that were created to be very hard ajuka beelzebubsama and his servants created magiccircle technique problems that work on the monsters and they told the people in the alliance who are fighting on the front lines ajukasama started creating the techniques when the monsters first appeared while being in contact with falbium asmodeussama i heard that he completed making it when we went to visit him at the human world buchou says that while watching the screen from the information i received falbium asmodeussama is
in charge of the battle strategy thanks to the two maous who used their intellects all of the bandersnatch are now stalled and receiving damage it is the gigantic monsters vs leviatan when the channel changed serafall leviathansama appears on the television i heard that she couldnt sit back while the underworld was in a crisis so she left the maou territory to start a fight with one of the bandersnatch on her own very thick ice appears on the screen its the favourite technique of serafall leviathansama the wasteland turned into a world of ice bandersnatch of course isnt safe from such an attack and more than half of its body is now frozen the demonicpower difference is way too large a demonicattack that can affect the land itself this is the power of maou leviathan on the other channel tanninsama and his servant dragons have just cornered one of the bandersnatch they are now receiving the technique that works on them there arent many people who can withstand his fire breath which is said to be at the same level as that of a maou hahaue5 please do your best on another channel a kyuubi6 shoots a flame
at a bandersnatch its yasakasan from kyoto the one on her back is the small priestess kunouchan they are rampaging while leading many youkai in battle looks like the youkai faction from kyoto came to help out during the crisis of the devils isekun will be happy if he learns of this from the information i received earlier the oldmaou factions who are rampaging throughout each city are now being pushed backah finally one of the bandersnatch has been stopped the shout of the reporter can be heard from the screen the first one to take down a bandersnatch is the alliance army led by emperor belial the humanoid bandersnatch is lying on the ground defeated most of its enormous body is destroyed and it seems as if its no longer capable of moving i can hear the roars of victory across the screen in this advantageous situation it seems like all the bandersnatch will be taken down within half a day the problem is the remaining problem would be jabberwocky who is heading towards the capital of the territory of maou i can hear a familiar voice coming from behind me when i turn around the valkyrie rosseweissesan is
standing there rossweisse i have returned riassan shes come back from northern europe then rossweissesan says it with a serious expression i heard about isekun earlier well he is the one who has such a large craving for riassan and akenosans breasts so he should be returning here very soon shes saying the same thing as xenovia isekun its possible that all of the girls in the gremory group might have that same opinion well so do i anyway if isekun and gasperkun return then the gremory group will be back together i thought that was a wish that wouldnt come true but now its different we can definitely have everyone together again theres no way that the gremory group could be separated that easily weve been through so much bloodshed together and im sure that wont be changing from now on either everyone knows that this group the occult research club is gathering once again and they all have confidence in this everyone its an emergency the one who came here in panic is ravelsan she went to bring us tea earlier but she never returned until now she then told us with a serious expression the sitri group
who were guarding the evacuating civilians hasstarted a battle against those from the khaos brigade that became the signal for the gremory team to head out part 2 the capital city of the maou territory in the underworld devil side lilith the area is roughly the same size as the capital city of japan tokyo in terms of culture it is no different and there are very tall buildings and public transport present it may be a bit different compared to other developed countries but it is definitely a city but that city is drawing into a crisis thats because the irregular gigantic monster jabberwocky is drawing near if it arrives the capital will receive a very devastating blow and the capital would become dead if the capital goes down there is no doubt that other areas throughout the underworld would also be affected right now the lucifer group grayfiasama and sirzechssamas other servants are taking jabberwocky on it is the group that is said to be the strongest among all devils right now they are evenly matched and even though they arent causing any critical damage to jabberwocky they are still succeeding in stalling it looking at their fight
from the news they are having an even flashier fight than serafallsama and they are stalling jabberwocky while also changing the area around it its my first time seeing them from a television but the demonicpowers released by grayfiasama are even more overwhelming than i imagined and they have so much destructive power that they are annihilating the land itself so this is the true form of the ultimate queen who is also the wife of maou sirzechs lucifer it might be natural for buchou to see her as her elder sister who she can respect but the monster who cant even be defeated by the lucifer group led by grayfiasama is the jabberwocky how much hatred does one need to create such a monster but i heard that thanks to the lucifer group the evacuation of the city is almost complete young devils such as the sitri group are being dispatched to confirm whether there is anyone who has been left behind i also heard that sairaorg bael is taking on the oldmaou faction devils who are rampaging in the capital we the gremory group and irinasan have just arrived in the northwest district of the capital using the
big magic circle located in the basement of gremory castle we left ravelsan in the gremory castle she was dragged into our battle in theartificial dimension the other day but she is a guest we cant have her getting involved in our battles we and ravelsan understand that although she seemed very upset that she wouldnt be of use to us and she still accepted our thoughts we appeared at the tallest building in the district when we arrived from the magic circle now we have to catch up to the sitri group then someone calls out to us eeveryone iim glad its gasperkun people from the fallen angel group told me that everyone would come here but i was lonely because no one was here gasperkun has teary eyes we are finally reunited with him the only one left is isekun when he returns the gremory group will be resurrected once again gasper im looking forward to seeing the results of your training buchou says that to gasperkun buthis eyes seem dark and the colour of his face isnt that good yyes i will do my best to live up to your expectations umm where is isesenpai gasperkun looks
around trying to find isekun did he not receive the information about isekun isekun is it happens as i was about to give him the details over there konekochan points in a certain direction when we look we see a huge black dragon wrapped in black flames rampaging thats sajikun we fly up into the sky after seeing that we arrive at the location where we saw sajikun in his dragonking form it has lots of tall buildings and we are at the road this place is surrounded by flames where buildings and roads are destroyedi can see the town that has turned into a sea of fire from up in the air its fortunate that we dont sense any presences around there are no cars moving on the roads and there is no one walking either it seems most of the evacuation here is finished gremory group i hear a familiar voice and when i turn around i see the girls from the sitri group protecting a bus that has lost one of its wheels there are many children inside the car how is the situation buchou asks the knight megurisan from the sitri group we encountered the hero
faction while we were traveling on this road they began to attack us immediately after they found out we were the sitri group the bus received a minor attack which stopped it from moving so we could only fight back and kaichou fukukaichou and genchan have megurisan says it with a voice mixed with a cry what happened to sajikun look at that rossweissesan points to the direction to the right we then see sajikun getting his throat grabbed by the huge man from the hero faction heracles on a street where there are many shops sajikuns body is covered in blood and it seems like he is about to lose consciousness we also see sonakaichou who is on the ground and shinrafukukaichou who is fighting against jeanne heracles throws sajikun away after finding him boring and then steps on sonakaichous back who is laying on the ground guu sonakaichou screams to step on a woman who is on the ground what an unforgivable action heracles laughs loudly what is this i was expecting more because you won the rating game match against the archduke agares is this itdont speak nonsense you just focused your aim on the bus filled
with children kaichou and saji couldnt give their all because they were protecting them you are the one who made them do that shinrafukukaichou says it with anger while crying her expression is that of anger and frustration for shinrafukukaichou to show such expressions she must be really frustrated and the reason for that is because heracles aimed at the bus filled with children he attacked kaichou and sajikun with such cowardly attacks i was filled with anger after hearing of such a cowardly act if isekun heard that he would go and hit heracles without any moment to spare the only enemies here are heracles and jeanne i dont see cao cao or georg anywhere are they acting separately jeanne makes a sigh after pushing back shinrafukukaichou with a holysword i did tell him that he shouldnt you know though i didnt stop heracles at all jeanne creates countless holyswords on the ground in order to destroy fukukaichous footpath jeanne attacks fukukaichou with her sword who then loses her balance i run to her immediately i close my distance and block her strike with gram can you stop already i say it with a low voice jeanne gets astonished
when she sees the weapon in my hand gram dont tell me siegfried is i have gram and the other swords siegfried had on my hips inside a sheath after i defeated him these demonic swords also accepted me as their new master i never thought i would become the owner of demonic swords like that i seriously cant predict what will happen when i am with this group heh that guy must be quite pathetic for losing against these guys heracles just laughs looks like they dont have that much passion for their comrades so the main members of the hero faction are continuously getting taken down we might end up being annihilated if we continue to get involved with the gremory groupanother voice the one that appears with the mist is georg the mist user continuously getting taken down perhaps the boy who possesses the annihilation maker can not fight anymore it seems like he was forced to do a reckless thing back in the artificial dimension by shalba beelzebub georg then says im sorry heracles jeanne the black flame of vritra over there was denser than i thought so it took a while to dispel it into
another dimension it has been a while since i made a dimension for dispel just like the legend says it certainly had an ability with a strong curse and grasping damn vritra ha even though he is still inexperienced you defeated one of the dragonkings as to be expected from a longinus possessor aye georg heracles praises him i see so they defeated sajikun by georg taking the control of the battle i can understand sajikun of the dragonking being defeated by this longinus possessor who also specialises in magic on top of that it seems like they attacked the bus filled with children i have gram in my right hand and a holydemonic sword in left hand and wielded two swords the offensive aura goes towards heracles and jeanne both of them dodge it easily but i get their guard down i pick up shinrafukukaichou quickly and go to where sonakaichou and sajikun are at you are fast a magic circle used for magic appears on georgs palm i wont let him use it i made the holydemonic sword disappear and then i make a command my knight troops dragonknight troops appear around me i command them to take
sonakaichou sajikun and shinrafukukaichou away yes this is good whats left now is georg releases a huge fireball a fire magic i hold onto gram with both my hands and cut the fireball in half with grams sharpness this is a piece of cake i dont want to admit it but in every aspects of durability destructive power and sharpness they are superior to the swords i create seeing my action georg makes a comment of admiration strong to save all your comrades while taking on three of us so this is the holydemonic sword user kiba yuuto you are a bit in theshadow of sekiryuutei but rias gremory certainly possesses a terrifying knight thank you for your complimentis that what i should be saying im okay with being the shadow isekun is the hero i only have to become the sword of rias gremory yes that would be enough for me the ones who get the spotlight on the stage should be my master buchou and my best friend isekun im just the sword nothing more nothing less are you okay asiasan starts healing kaichou and sajikun a green aura is emitted from her having her in the center
a healing aura which has a wide range because of asiasans personality it heals both allies and enemies but since there is quite a distance from the herofaction i dont have to worry about that even if they try to attack her me and my comrades will stop them a child was holding onto it very preciously the doll of oppaidragon ifi let the children get hurt i can never catch up to him ever again sajikun who is barely conscious says that while getting healed he is shedding tears of regret sajikun youendured this muchonly by seeing that tsubaki we will take care of them can i leave the evacuation of the children inside the bus to you buchou says it to shinrasenpai fukukaichou looks at us the enemies and the children but please fukukaichou we will pay them back for what they did to you we have inherited the feelings of you and sajikun i say that yes the thing sajikun wanted to protect is the same thing we wanted to protect we cant forgive the herofaction who attacked them we will finish them here kibakun yes i understandshinrafukukaichou replies like that this is good with this the
children will be safe whats left is for us to defeat them kibakun used the power of goodlooking guys on fukukaichousan you seriously cant talk bad about isekun irinasan is overreacting with joy well i will let it slide for now xenovia takes a step forward now then lets do it my durandal is reforged once again it wont be good if i dont rampage with it xenovia takes the cloth off of her weapon what appears is exdurandal which looks exactly the same and it should have been reforged by adding excalibur ruler on top of it i dont see any differences in the shape of it except the aura around it is completely different than before the silent aura of the holysword that has been compressed was now enveloping the blade in reality it is the hybrid of the trueexcalibur formation of all seven excalibur and durandal the specs must be overwhelming i also received something good as well irinasan draws the sword that she has on her hip oh my i didnt realise it until she drew the sword out the sword that irinasan is carrying isa holydemonic sword irinasan smiles when she sees my reaction yes
this is the mass produced holydemonic sword produced from the holydemonic sword kibakun gave the heavens during the time when the alliance was being formed between the three great powers this is one of the test types it received quite a lot of customisation so the angels can wield it it isnt as strong and it doesnt have as much variety as kibakuns but it is enough for an angel to wield so the heavens side has been creating such things because of the characteristic of the holydemonic sword resulting from the absence of god it can only be used away from the vatican and heaven but it certainly is a good support i feel like a parent who just witnessed the growth of their child it looks like my holydemonic sword is being useful to the alliance xenovia points her sword at jeannei had some debts to repay to siegfried but it cant be helped if kiba and the others defeated him so i will help irina instead with her payback irinasan agrees to xenovias aggressive words yes yes im going to have my payback for kyoto you are no good even if you are a person who inherited
the soul of a saint irinasan also copies xenovia and points her sword at jeanne i think they make a good team ara ara then can i also join in she probably has that so it will be better to have more people it seems like akenosan will also be taking on jeanne akenosan must have stepped in because of the concern regarding chaos drive we wont know what enhancement jeanne would get when she uses it its a good judgement to take her on with several people six wings appear from her back after the two bracelets on her wrist glow in gold its the fallenangel transformation from before akenosan said she needs the support of the bracelets to transform but she wants to be able to transform without it in the future the power sleeping within her must have awoken completely jeanne makes a smile full of confidence at the challenge she received from three of them hee so three people are going to be fighting me also the oneesan over there seems like she knows about that interesting balancebreak when she says it with a strong voice a dragon made from holyswords appears behind her its the
subspecies balance breaker of jeannes blade blacksmith it has a dense pressure like before shes not an opponent who you can have your guard down against even so xenovia makes her stance this exdurandal has the ability of all seven excaliburs if i master it i will obtain an even greater power its just like she says it has each of the seven excaliburs abilities in it if she gets used to it it will have high enough specs to fight against cao caos balancebreaker thats what i thought but xenovia then says it up front unfortunately im dumb even though i gained more techniques i wont be able to use them very well thats why i will be using thisxenovia swings the exdurandal a huge crater is made in the ground along with the violent sound of an explosion it will be enough with the destructive powers of excalibur and durandal declaration of absolute destructive powers xenovia can you also pay attention to using techniques since you are also a knight with the way she uses them it seems like she could perform better than me xenovia makes a displeased face after she realises i am looking at her
muu kiba you thought i was a power idiot just now didnt you but i have to say that the only one who specialises in techniques should be enough with just you thats why i will just aim for only destructive powers please hear me can you also pay attention to techniques our group is filled with powertypes and we lack techniquetypes its wrong for the formation of our party7 if i am the only techniquetype this is very serious the lack of techniques in the gremory group is very serious indeed i could only feel uneasy for the future games i should state this seriously to buchou next time that i want her to raise another technique type that is the man who goes through the most hardship kiba yuuto thank you konekochan i will try my best a bit longer then follow me then a devil an angel and a fallenangel i sure am popular jeanne says it with joy and goes on top of her dragon the dragon goes up the tall building nearby using its feet after its master lands on top of its back xenovia irinasan and akenosan spread their wings out and fly after
her a violent clash happens in the air immediately those three should have an advantage in their fight against jeanne so the only ones left are heracles and georg i then ask georg why did you target the bus actually why are you in the capital i couldnt understand the reason for targeting the children i didnt think they would just target that bus and why were they here in this city did they come to rob after the people were evacuated from here because of the monsters that sounds unlikelyi will answer the second question first its sight seeing cao cao said he wanted to see how far those gigantic monster can go with his own eyes georg answered the reason they came here is for sight seeing or an escort for cao cao who wanted to look around but cao cao himself isnt here was he watching like a vip from somewhere he sure is a creepy man like always then why did you target the bus i ask him once again georg just sighs we happened to encounter the bus by luck then we saw saji gennshirou of the vritra and sitrigroup riding on the bus they
also know our faces so we cant help it if we get into a fight right so it was just a unfortunate encounter then but heracles makes a provocative smile its also because i agitated him you know we met with that vritra by chance its lacking to only see the monster invasions so i said fight me if you dont want the children to get involved so like that the fight started you started a fightwith a foolish reason like that sajikun accepted to protect the children while i was getting filled up with anger i heard that the herofaction is a gathering of heroes who are seeking to fight against the abnormals but it looks like there was scum among them a man appears in front of us a gigantic lion covered in golden fur and the one bringing the lion with him is the man who has absolute power a pure embodiment of power itself the man who fought me xenovia rossweissesan and isekun and the one who awakened the truequeen with only his martial arts sairaorg buchou calls out the mans name yes it is the entrance of sairaorg bael part 3i cant remember what date
it was but azazelsensei made a certain comment if there is someone out of the young devils including riass group who can fight against ise head on and is further increasing his power then there is only one person sairaorg bael the man who almost defeated isekun and caused the awakening to truequeen he appears while bringing the huge lion regulus he takes a step forward while having regulus remain on a spot he just said one short sentence i will go sairaorg bael takes off his shirt his body which has been trained magnificently shows up the pure fighting spirit touki is emitting from his body i just finished taking down the oldmaou faction remnants who were making a ruckus at the capital then i saw a black dragon saji genshirou in the distance i only saw him in the video recorded in the game but i realised that it was him immediately and that he was fighting something great sairaorg bael looks at heracles heracles makes a smile of joy after seeing the fighting spirit of sairaorg bael the next heir to the house of bael huh i know you the talentless next heir who was born without
the power of destruction which is the trait of the house of bael i hear that you can only fight with your body even though you are a devil hahaha its my first time hearing of such an unreasonable devil sairaorg bael doesnt change his expression even with heracles taunt a small insult like this means nothing to him compared to the insults he has been receiving for half of the time he spent in his life the one who inherited the soul of the hero heracles yeah thats right baelsan sairaorg bael rejects heracles while approaching him slowly looks like it was my misunderstanding someone as weak as you cant possibly be a herohearing that heracles face changes his pride must have showed up after hearing that hee i heard you had a hitting contest with sekiryuutei what a loser if its a devil then its demonicpowers you can say that the embodiment of demonicpowers and supernatural phenomenon using demonicpowers is the way of the devils so what do we call you and sekiryuutei then no matter how much heracles taunts him sairaorg baels expression doesnt change but heracles taunts still continue i heard you have the sacred gear
with the nemean lion that was defeated by the original heracles its ironic that you met me then you cant beat me unless you use that you know sairaorg bael answers heracles with one sentence not using it ha i wont use the garment of the lion against the likes of you no matter how i look at you i cant think that you are stronger than sekiryuutei sairaorg bael just says that heracles laughs loudly after hearing that hahahaha there is nothing i cant blow up with my sacred gear even if you are covered in touki that is its nothing against my sacred gear heracles jumps up his hand is covered with a dangerous aura he grabs onto both of sairaorg baels arms and starts an explosive attack heracles sacred gears ability allows him to blow up things while attacking at the same time but sairaorg bael says it simply like this i see so this is it his expression doesnt change even as his flesh is ripped and blood begins to flow out heracles seems completely angry and the aura in both his hands increases hehehe you sure know how to talk then hows this he then
thrusts his fists against the road then the road itself explodes and envelops sairaorg baels whole bodysmoke dust and ash completely cover the surroundings the road where the two of them were standing is completely destroyed and has turned into rubble heracles makes a big laugh on top of the rubble hahahahahahahahaha see that he died without doing anything thats why devils who cant use demonic powers are defective what can you possibly do with only martial arts heracles stops his sentence there his expression changes to one of astonishment thats because there is a man standing in the middle of the road as if nothing happened sairaorg bael who only has minor wounds with blood coming out is still wearing the same expression is this it heracles backs down after seeing the touki of sairaorg bael which hasnt even decreased a bit dont underestimate me you shitty devil he says that but he isnt as confident as before sairaorg bael finally makes his move towards heracles while emitting strong pressure he is closing his distance from heracles step by step i was expecting a bit more because i heard you carry the soul of the hero heracles looks like
my expectations keep on being betrayed heracles makes a stance with both his hands but sairaorg bael disappears hes quick he appears right in front of heracles he appears in front of his opponent on purpose i can only be shocked by the way he fights his opponents its my turn don a heavy sharp and accurate fist gets thrusted into heracles stomach that single blow goes past heracles body and destroys the building behind him because of the destructive power he didnt expect his expression changes to that of confusion and then to that of extreme pain he kneels down on the ground and grabs his stomach with his hands he spits out blood from his mouth he must have received an intense pain which cant be described in words i know that because ive also received his punch before there is not a single person who can be unharmed after receiving that punch its obvious he received critical damage the situation changed with just a single punch rossweissesans magic couldnt even cause heracles critical damage but his punch does that easily sairaorg bael then says it while looking down on heracles whats wrong that hit just now was
just a normal punch the sekiryuutei who you made fun of didnt even flinch for a single moment from that punch you know hearing that heracles makes a creepy laugh he then stands up with an angry expression dont screw around with me you damn mere devil you dont have demonic powers you dont even use sacred gear with just a normal punch heracles whole body glows the light surrounding his body forms the shape of a missile its balancebreaker he shot those missiles in kyoto and made rossweissesan have a hard time a weapon which is everywhere on his body that has intense destructive powers you wont be able to defeat me while making a roar he shoots the missiles in every direction we also felt it would be dangerous so we made a stance to evade it many missiles hit various places in the city and violently destroyed many buildings roads and public property one of the missiles goes towards sairaorg bael head on hmph hit sairaorg bael didnt even dodge the missile created from the sacred gear and he just hit it away with a punch what kind of fist does he have he just hit the
missile away with ease once again i became shocked by the punching power of this person who is the next heir of the house of great king all the missiles directed at him are hit away with his fists themissiles that are hit away crash into buildings and roads one of the missiles shot is flying in the direction of where the children are this is bad if that hits but my worries ended there thats because rossweissesan stood in front of the children rossweissesan blocked the missile completely by having a defence magiccircle in front of her her shield which was broken through back in kyoto is now even more powerful this is a new defence magic i am a rook so i thought i should increase my defence which is the trait of a rook i learned many defence magics in my homeland by using my trait of defence and my magical attack i am still able to endure against balancebreakers that specialise in destructive power heracles your powers wont work against me anymore i will show you that i can block 10 times the power of that attack just now the reason rossweissesan returned to her homeland
was because she could increase her trait she increased her defence by learning powerful defence magic rossweissesan has once again increased her trait as a rook the gremory group is getting even more powerful isekun while i was getting happy with the power ups of my comrades i then saw the children lionsan do your best lion dont lose it was a cheer to sairaorg bael who is fighting against heracles sairaorg bael puts on an astonished face because he didnt expect this the children must know about sairaorg bael through the match against ise he then laughs happily fuhahahahahaha sairaorg baels touki increases even more those kids told me to do my best and not to lose this seriously feels good doesnt it hyoudou issei so this is the power you can receive from the children theres not even the slightest chance you can win now hero heracles dont get all happy because of the kids saying stuff to youuuuu you brainless greatkinga fist gets thrusted into the face of heracles who is yelling heracles kneels on the ground while having blood flow out from all the holes in his face what is itwith this punch the more he
gets hit by the greatking the more scared he gets its just a punch but that punch digs a hole through his body and soul its so deep that it gets carved deeply into his soul a person who cant even get cheers from the children shouldnt call himself a hero sairaorg bael looks at heracles with an expression filled with pressure heracles puts on a expression of despair as if he realised he cant win both physically and mentally but he gets something out from his pocket a pistol type injection and phoenix tear its chaos break there is a chance that the battle will turn the other way around if he uses that no sairaorg bael would be able to take him on if he puts on the balancebreaker but the increased destructive power would be able to destroy the entire landscape surrounding this place and he also has the phoenix tear we dont know how powerful heracles would get after he recovers and uses the chaos break ddamn you heracles says that while putting the tip of the injection to his neck but i can see that he is hesitant about it sairaorg bael questions him whats
wrong arent you going to use it judging from it it strengthens your body right if you want to use it then use it if you become stronger by using that then i will gladly accept that i will still surpass you even if you use that heracles has a frustrated face there is a bit of tears in his eyes because of frustration daaaaaaaaamn itttttttt he throws the chaos break and phoenix tear on the ground while howling with a cry he then goes towards sairaorg bael head onhe actually discarded the chaos break this is an unexpected turn of events sairaorg bael makes a stance for the first time after seeing his opponent looks like you regained your pride as a hero at the last moment not bad but sairaorg bael uses his left fist to hit away heracles punch and then covers his right fist with touki go down with this punch he hits him in his stomach a nice sound of a punch echoes throughout this area heracles goes down completely while losing consciousness i then remembered what isekun said he said this after the match against bael hey kiba sairaorgsan is really a mysterious person
i think it is foolish to hit him face to face and dodging his attacks would be the most appropriate thing even if i think like that in my head i realise that i am fighting against him head on thats the kind of person he is he makes you want to have a hitting contest with him and there is no reason behind that sairaorg baels fist brings back the pride of the scum who fell so low sairaorg bael who just defeated heracles looks great in my eyes right now part 4 sairaorg bael defeated heracles and akenosan and the others are currently taking on jeanne so the only enemy left now is georg though we certainly dont know when cao cao will show himself i can see intense holylighting and sacred aura exploding near the tall buildings it seems like the battle against jeanne is still going on the reason why the girls who have powered up havent returned yet is probably because jeanne used chaos break akenosan and the other two would have been able to defeat jeanne already if she was in her balancebreaker form the battle is lasting longer than i expected we have
quite the manpower if we also include sairaorg bael even if georg uses chaos break we still have a high chance of winning georg smiles after looking at the fallen heracles strong so this is the power of the current young devils sairaorg of the bael and the gremory group lead by rias gremory i met with you guys afew days ago but i never expected that you guys would have become even stronger at this rate the vampire and nekomata over there probably also have more power than our data says georg looks at konekochan and gasperkun well putting gasperkun aside konekochan didnt get any exceptional powerup since we left the artificialdimension her powerup will begin now i heard her sister kuroka is going to begin teaching her how to use youjutsu and senjutsu shes willing to be taught by her sister who she has a stiff relationship with so her determination must be very strong gasperkun turns blue after being looked at by georg gasper whats wrong buchou seems suspicious by the weird tension of her servant gasperkuns expression begins to break down and he eventually starts shedding tears what happened to gasperkun im sorry everyone ii i
couldnt get strongereven though i went to the grigori institute everyone gets shocked by gasperkuns confession he speaks while crying i wanted to get strongerso i could help everyone i was told that i cant get any stronger than this by the people at grigori i cant even protect a girl im a shame for the boys in the gremory group gasperkun breaks down crying so it was impossible for gasperkun to get stronger even at the grigori georg sighs out of boredom in response to gasperkun the late8 sekiryuutei wont be happy after seeing his kouhai9 in a pathetic condition like this gasperkun who hears that looks up front astonished the latesekiryuutei he looks around the surroundings and at us he still doesnt know the reason why isekun isnt herewhere is isesenpai isnt isesenpai not here because he went to stop the gigantic monster gasper ise is buchou tries to tell the truth to gasperkun who hasnt been informed yet but sairaorg bael looks at buchou and shakes his head buchou saw that and closed her lips so they arent going to tell the truth on purpose then what are sairaorg bael and buchou trying to do georg didnt
realise the reaction of the two kings and begins talking to gasperkun while smirking i see so you still dont know about it sekiryuutei died fighting against the oldmaou faction no there is no point in making up excuses now i guess he died fighting against us the chaos brigade most likely from receiving the poison of samael who is said to be the ultimate dragonslayer well we werent there to witness it so we dont have an accurate account but if sekiryuutei died then that must be the reason the herofaction still doesnt know that isekuns soul is wandering around the dimensional gap in that state normally dragons would die after receiving the poison of samael konekochan asiasan and rossweissesan realise that buchou isnt telling the truth on purpose of course like me they dont know the reason why no she probably isnt i begin to understand why she isnt telling the truth is sairaorg bael perhaps trying to awaken gasperkuns georg continues talking the more gasperkun listens to him the more his expression is changing to that of a dead person its painful to see my kouhai wearing an expression with such despair you dont have to worry
about it even that ophis and hakuryuukou vali were defeated by samael even sekiryuutei wont be able to survive against that curse georg chuckles after saying that isesenpaidied a single tear is shed from gasperkuns eye his whole body begins to shake and his eyes begin to get shady his thoughts must be filled with despair after hearing that the senpai whom he admired was killed he looks down and becomes silentgasperkun is experiencing the same feelings of despair that we were feeling until earlier today a moment of silence all of us couldnt endure seeing him in such a state and it happened as konekochan tried to approach him he starts to lift his shivering body up little by little he looks up as well gasperkun has an expression that is not found on a living person i realise that i can feel chills running down my back he opens his mouth and speaks a single word his voice is low and it sounds like a cursedie the moment after he says that the surroundings are completely covered in darkness the ground the sky the scenery everything is being enveloped by darkness its so dark and cold that even
the light has disappeared darkness is coming out of gasperkuns body and that is dyeing everything into black what is this georg becomes shocked by the sudden change and begins to look around darkness darkness darkness darkness the buildings that were there before vanished as if they were just a hallucination and everything except us turns into darkness its out of control or is it a balancebreaker no that isnt it the power of a vampire but this istotally on a different level even rossweissesan who specialises in magic is shocked at this scene its also my first time seeing an occurrence like this as well it must be different from balancebreaker what is this dimension that is covered in darkness in the territory that turned into darkness a weird humanoid appears and approaches georg it turns its head in a weird direction and begins shortening its distance from the mistuser by dragging its legs and rotating its shoulders its eyes are red very red eyes that are glowing very creepily i will kill you i will kill all of you till none of you are left its not gasperkuns voice this is a dangerous voice which includes all the
emotions of anger grudge and cursing sairaorg bael says it with his eyes open wide i thought he would change if he got pushed with the death of sekiryuutei thats because gasper vladi had the eyes of one with a past humiliation i thought that through pushing him we could cause the release of his powers that even grigori failed to unlock i couldnt believe that the organisation of that governor had failed to awaken his powers without doing anything its just like what he said its weird that the grigori who conducts so many experiments was unable to do anything about gasperkun just likesairaorg bael said he must have been awakening to something but had to return because there wasnt a catalyst to complete the awakening sairaorg bael then says this to buchou with serious eyes rias the power sleeping within gasper vladi was something that surpassed our imagination this is a one of a kind monster what kind of thing did you make into your servant the reason why the noble house of vampires the house of vladi ignored gasper wasnot because of forbidden balor view but because they knew about this power they discarded him from the
castle becausethey feared him buchou says it with a shivering voice gasperkun who turned into a black thingput his hand forward georg realises it and activates his magic circle but his magic circle gets eaten by darkness what is this its not magic its also not the power of a sacred gear how did you break my magic circle georg gets scared by gasperkuns actions and activates many offensive magic circle after stepping back many different spells with different attributes fall down on gasperkun even a very solidly built person will receive fatal damage if they receive that countless numbers of red eyes appear in the darkness and they make a mysterious glow then all the magic that was shot up in the air freezes its forbidden balor view he stopped the attacks easily with it and he made the eyes appear in various places the magical attacks which were frozen begin getting devoured by the darkness the one who is the most shocked about this is georg his face begins to change into that of one who is very scared the dark humanoid thing starts walking once again it has the presence and movements of a creature that doesnt
exist in the real world and it moves closer to georg georg then gathers mist into his hand the longinus dimension lost is he trying to defeat gasperkun with it he controls the mist to envelop gasperkun but once again his mists are devoured by the darkness around him devourdevour i have devoured it your magic and mist dont work i ate all of it his voice isnt the voice of the gasperkun we know we can think that he has turned into a completely different being even a hightier longinus cant stop gasperkun who became an endless darkness morethan that the mistuser georg cant even put up a fight against him the mutationpiece which was used on gasperkun i think i can understand the reason for it now he has this much power inside him in terms of potential abilities he must have been the highest in our group the match against bael changed him and this appeared with the shock of isekuns death and that form is in the shape of that darkness isekun perhaps the one who has the most potential for growth is gasperkun this is his appearance is on a level which surpasses our thoughts
hes not a devil or dragon i dont even know if we can classify him as a vampire either yes that is a completely different being georg releases all the magic attacks and mist abilities he can think of at gasperkun all of them get stopped by the eyes and then devoured by the darkness even though his attacks were erased he begins making a magic circle that is used to create barrier dimensions but it loses shape because it also gets devoured by the darkness the darkness around georg moves and starts to mold into the shape of beasts it looks like wolves gigantic birds and even dragons but none of them have a proper shape oneeyed wolves five winged birds two mouthed dragons spiders with more than ten legs all of them look like creatures that have surpassed the existing creatures these abnormal monsters gather around georg did gasperkun create them as well ku my mist my magics arent working what is he what on earth is he georgs expression is one of despair no matter how you look at it its gasperkuns complete victory no can we even call this a battle isnt he being attacked by
an existence that surpasses normal existences thats how overwhelming it is this is the true power of gyakun konekochan who can only stand there and watch is barely able to say that the change in her friend certainly surpassed many things ku i have to retreat at once georg gives up on trying to take on gasperkun whos powers and abilities have surpassed anyones thoughts and he makes a magic circle appear below his feethes trying to escape but it happened when his body was engulfed by the light of transportation a black flame appeared from his body this is i then look at sajikun he has regained his consciousness and is glaring at georg while lifting his upper body up i wont let you escape you guys killed my friend theres no way i will let you off the hook sajikun puts his hand forward with a deep voice the black flame around georg turns into the shape of an enormous snake and envelops him sajikuns black dragonkings flame its said that it will continue being attached until the opponents life has been completely drained georg takes out a small bottle phoenix tear from his pocket but the black
flame also devours the small bottle vritrascurse georg says that the curse which he thought he had already removed wasnt completely gone then the abnormal monsters made from darkness begin attacking him the very powerful magician who possesses a hightier longinus is devoured by the darkness in silence when the darkness cleared we had returned to the capital lilith where we had been before gasperkun is lying down georg is nowhere to be seen did he get devoured completely by the darkness i walk towards gasperkun and look at his face he is just sleeping peacefully i cant even sense the slightest bit of danger from him now he must have fainted after using that power buchou holds him in her arms and pats his hair gently so many things occurred that i now need to question the vampires but vampires hate devils i dont know if the house of vladi will answer me when i asked to speak with them previously they refused me vampires they take heed of classes even more than the devils and they classify between pure vampires and ones below them completely tomake it simpler there are basically no vampires who take care of their
comrades like the gremorys they also dont give an opportunity to the former humans like the current government of the devils does absolute pure blood aristocratic society the clan of the immortals the rulers of the night there are many strong people among them especially the day walkers who can move during the day there are a very limited number of ways to defeat them and the devils cant take them on easily i heard an interesting story when i returned to valhalla that a certain noble vampire house captured a longinus possessor and that battles between vampires began rossweissesan says that so something like that is happening many things are happening while the underworld is in danger that is true but you should also be careful with magicians from now on sonakaichou who woke up says that what do you mean buchou asks sonakaichou continues after fixing the position of her glasses the magicians principle of strength and talents among them georg who you just defeated is a topclass magician so it wont be weird for the magicians council to take an interest in your group for defeating him your group is already famous for being strong to begin
with the magicians the ones who use summoning spells make a name for themselves by making a contract with devils with power especially young devils who have bright futures will be summoned for negotiations famous devils already have a contract with someone or have high prices if they were to make contracts so there are magicians who make contracts with young devils that havent been touched yet in the near future they will definitely come and contact you magicians they are also a troublesome existence in their own ways though the relations between devils and magicians have existed since ancient times so we will be seen as a contract target by them then i felt it i felt a presence behind meara ara looks like heracles was defeated and also georg this is bad the one who appeared is jeanne she has wounds everywhere and she looks very tired shes holding something when i looked carefully shes holding onto a small boy hold on jeanne that isnt fair to hold a child as a hostage she certainly fooled us i never would have thought there was a parent and child who hadnt evacuated yet judging from it akenosan and the
others were at an advantage but jeanne escaped by taking the boy hostage we confront jeanne she points the blade of the holysword to the boys neck its not something which i a devil can say but thats a cowardly act such a coward sairaorg bael said what i was also thinking jeanne then laughs because she finds it funny its not something that devils can say right though it sounds like someone such as yourself who has strong principles the shishiou10 of the house of bael anyway i will have myself call cao cao you guys are too strong for me to just run away so this boy will be my hostage until cao cao comes ok jeanne says that it will certainly be hard if cao cao comes here it feels likely with sairaorg bael here but we still dont know if we can defeat that man with the holyspear ara you seem more quiet than i thought boy cant say anything because you are too scared jeanne says that after looking at the boy who she has hostage just like she said the boy seems like he isnt scared the boy then says it with a smile
nope im not scared at all because oppai dragon will be coming very soon his words didnt have any fear in them and he seems very relievedfufufu too bad boy oppai dragon died this big sisters friend defeated him thats why oppai dragon cant come here anymore jeanne says that but the boy hasnt lost his smile why how can you still smile like that even in this situation its okay i made a promise in my dream when i was sleeping because i was scared of the big monster he appeared in my dream dream he saw a dream about isekun the boy said happily and energetically he said he will come here soon so i shouldnt cry he said he will definitely return when we make a magic chant he then uses his index finger to draw a circle in the air i have to draw a circle like this and press the middle like this zoom zoom iyaan he said he will definitely return when i do this everyone else saw the same dream as well ferrerkun and tullaschan also saw the same dream as me the children in the other class also saw the same dream
everyone saw the same dream everyone saw the same dream all the children saw the same dream dream about isekun i was in doubt and the boy looks up the sky and sang the song is a song made for him and the children who love him there is an oppai loving dragon living in the edge of a certain country then it happened a sound was heard from the sky of the capital when i looked up a dimensional crack was seen in the sky then that appeared from the crack i felt that aura of his that i dearly missed this is certainly the return of the childrens herolife 0 a dream i hyoudou issei nodded at ddraigs question yeah i saw a weird dream when i was sleeping many children were crying when i asked them why they told me they were crying because they were scared of the big monsters thats why i told the children that i would appear when they draw a circle and press the middle by saying zoom zoom iyaaan ddraig sighs after hearing me for you to do such a posture when you hated it when other people did them i
couldnt help it i thought an act like that was needed to cheer up the children and when i did that the nervousness disappeared from the childrens faces oppai sure is amazing ddraig makes an even deeper sigh well im talking about what happened in my dream so dont let it get to you haa you are right so how is your new body ddraig asks me i just had my soul transferred to my new body that was taken out of the cocoon it felt weird seeing my body in front of me but i again realised that it is my body after i got my soul transferred into it there isnt the slightest change in my new body from my previous one my sense of touch is working when i make a grip hell yeah with this i can grope rias and akenosans oppai i began doing image training by moving my fingers aaah the rich oppai of rias and the elastic oppai of akenosan which sticks onto my hands remembering about them can easily refill my stomach ten times yes my body is working i have my armour on as well so what kind of change is
there compared to my previous body then appearance shape and certain parts are the same as that of a human you can continue your life normally like before but since the evilpieces are missing from your body you can say that you are a humanoid dragoneven though there was help from ophis you received your flesh from great red you can say that you are a small truedragon so in other words i am like great reds child on top of that uroboros power is added into it even in this state your basic physical abilities have improved a bit from before well you were originally crap to begin with so it only improved that much im sorry for originally being crap i was just an ordinary high school boy the merit of it is improvement of your physical abilities which i just stated and i cant predict what kind of growth you will be going through after having the power of truedragon and dragongod added to you also it is okay for you to move away from great red now wasnt my power already hard to predict anyway because of breastpower and stuff well that is true the demerit
is like i said before you lost many abilities because you no longer have the evilpieces within you that were the source of your abilities also the danger of dragonslayers has greatly increased since you have gained the powers of greatred and ophis those two demerits are certainly bad well for the evilpieces i can ask rias for them again but its also very frightening to learn that the damage ill receive from dragonslayers has increased as well it really is hard to describe that pain in words if possible i would desire never to feel such a pain ever again now what should we do from here then even if i stay the only thing here is the golems that have already stopped functioning gogmagog that are floating throughout the dimensional gap those golems were actually floating in the dimensional gap then it happened as i was thinking of a way to return to everyone i heard a familiar melody what isnt this look partner i looked up after ddraig urged me on the sky it was reflected the smiles of the children in the underworld begin appearing throughout the sky the children draw a circle and press the
middle they then sing that song very loudly and energeticallythere is an oppai loving dragon living in the edge of a certain country the dragon goes for a walk when the weather is good dragon dragon oppaidragon gropegrope sucksuck pafupafu there are so many types of oppai but he likes the big ones the best the oppaidragon also flies today in a edge of a certain town the oppaidragon was laughing even in a stormy day the oppaidragon becomes happy by pressing oppai dragon dragon oppaidragon clickclick zoomzoom iyaaan he has seen lots of oppai but he likes big ones the best oppaidragon also pushes today greatred is saying that he is reflecting the feelings of all the children in the underworld here all of are you serious so this song is from the children who are calling out to me im so happy that my chest is full everyone is calling out to me greatred represents dreams the dream one has the dream one saw the dream one imagined he is showing it to us maybe your strong wish to return home has made greatred appear by responding to your dream ddraig says that the one who represents dreams
so greatred appeared by responding to my wish and maybe greatred is showing this to usyeah but this is real the children are singing for me and it even reached here it has reached me i couldnt keep my tears from falling down when i saw the smiles of the children and heard their song weird the song i detested so much now it feels strong to me kukuku looks like im seriously breaking down now let it be ddraig this song is something which is very warm thats right i am an oppaidragon that lives in an edge of a certain country and flies to look for oppai both in shiny and rainy days while laughing thats because i love oppai i have to return to everyones side yeah lets go back partner can i ask you to do that greatred can you return this man to those childrens places ddraig asks the sekiryuushintei greatred makes a single loud howl then the space in front of us bends and a crack is made11 from there i can see a very large town i can sense a familiar aura from there judging from the colour of the sky that must
be the underworld yeah its an aura which makes my heart feel at peace my pals aura my important comrades aura and the aura of the woman i love i then said it to ophis next to me ophis im going to the place where i can return i see that makes me a bit jealous ophis seems lonely you dont need to feel lonely anymore right i then gave my hand to ophis you are coming with me ophis opens her eyes wide and seems astonished i said it with a smile you are friends with me right then come lets go together this moment the dragon which is said to be the strongest smiles ddraig and i are friends i will go together with you ophis and i took each others hand yes this is good this is okay lets go home shall we to the place we can return tolife1 crimson promise part 1 i went out of the dimensional gap along with greatred and i was shocked at what appeared in front of my eyes there is a gigantic monster in front of me its a humanoidtype but it seems like a chimera monster because it
is a mix of body parts from dragons lions and more and it is even bigger than greatred who i am currently riding on ah i realised it immediately that is the antimonster which was born from the annihilation maker in the dimensional gap thats the monster that bastard shalba created using a forbidden technique when i look afar i can see the town i see so this monster is heading there the curse shalba put inside the monsters is to make them destroy the cities of the underworld more like everything around it is destroyed countless numbers of craters are formed on the ground and everything around it such as buildings forests and mountains are destroyed this isnt the only monster created back in the artificial dimension if this thing is the only one here then that means the other ones are either already defeated or are currently destroying other towns i can only feel uneasy about this what a bastard that bastard shalba sure is a goodfornothing true maou i was right in beating him so what should i do about that monster then i then saw grayfiasan while i was sitting on greatred arara grayfiasan is she
fighting that monster along with the other people who have insane auras dont tell me those are sirzechsamas servants the lucifergroup if thats the case then it makes sense i can feel an overwhelming atmosphere and aura from them is the person wearing something which looks like shinsengumis haori 12 sirzechsamas knight ah enkusan the kirin is there as well they are all experienced guys they all have abnormal powers ddraig says that yeah dont tell me even those people are having a hard time against the monster no matter how i look at it the monster doesnt have any remarkable damage though it doesnt seem like they are having a hard time eitherputting that aside the monster has noticed us all six of its eyes are directed at us and it has begun showing hostility towards us its natural that this happened because greatred is also big what did you say are you seriously saying that huh ddraig is speaking to someone did something happen yeah greatred said i dont like that monster because it glared at me ii see so it gained the wrath of sekiryuushinnteisama it sure did glare at us i never thought greatred cared about
stuff like this he sounds like a delinquent high schooler is the reason why it likes to swim in the dimensional gap similar to the way yankees love to rampage on their bikes is it really a peaceful dragon anyway partner greatred is saying it will lend its powers so lets defeat that monster ddraig says something outrageous defeat it something that big and im included in it bbut how if the lucifergroup which includes grayfiasan cant defeat it then it would also be impossible for me even if im in the truequeen form you know sensei once made a comment that my power is comparable to highclass devils and higher my truequeen form is equal to sairaorgsan in his balancebreaker form the truth is i think i can even put up a good fight against ultimateclass devils but if the people from the lucifer group who are considered the strongest among devils cant beat that monster then it would be impossible for me as well i have a bad feeling about this impossible request then ophis says it it is okay ddraig and greatred should combine ddraigs current body it is kind of the same as the truedragon you
can combine ddraig is she talking about me i cant tell who she is referring to at times wait combine me and greatredcombiiiiiiiiiiine what do you mean are you telling me i can combine with him because my current body is a part of him something crazy like that cant possibly i couldnt tell whether ophis is being serious or just joking then greatreds body started to emit a very bright red aura its an amazing amount of light the red aura dyes the whole place red then my body began to get covered by that light as wellhm when i opened my eyes what appears right in front of me is a monster uwaa after being enveloped by the red lighthow come it makes a monster appear right in front of me waithuh i became doubtful after i looked at the monster in front of meits a monster which i have seen before but that monster should have been much bigger the monster in front of me is identical to the gigantic monster which glared at greatred it has sixeyes and it looks like a chimera did you regain consciousness partner i heard ddraigs voice yeah i have but
why is there a monster that is identical to the gigantic monster from before in fornt of me judging from the looks of it is it the same size as me no that monster is two heads taller than me of course it is thats because you became bigger i was astonished for a moment and became speechless at ddraigs words eh eh eeeh i look down at my feet there are countless buildings which look like miniature buildings there are forests and rivers it looks like a diorama set i look at my whole body its boosted gear scalemail theres no doubt about it when i turned around there is the town from before eh tthen i really am im actually a giaaaaaaaaaaaaaaant my words echo throughout the area of course what is this am i really in a gigantic balance breaker state ah theres grayfiasan and others they are looking at me they really are small at one glance grayfiasan only looks like a figure did i really turn big yeah thats right so you finally understand it greatred said that he will lend his power to you right this is what it means greatred made you into
its size just like ophis said by combining and thus you became super gigantic super giganticcombination shit what did i combine with a gigantic dragon for if i had to combine i wanted to combine with rias and akenosan goaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaathe monster in front of me made a roar and started heading towards my direction it came charging forward while destroying its surroundings with the quakes it makes damn it what should i do answer me ddraig it is the same method you can move your body like you usually do it seems like greatred allowed us to be in control of it just think that your body became bigger i see that really is easy to understand now we can get right into business i gave a right straight punch to the monster coming at me my punch nailed right into its face while making a sharp sound the monster trembles with that punch i thought it caused it a lot of damage because it moved its facebut instead it gathered dangerous fire around its mouth covered in sharp teeth is it trying to breathe fire partner if that fire goes back past us to the city there will be
casualties isnt evading it a bad idea i know that ddraig then if i cant dodge it then i will i put my right hand forward and made a stance to do dragonshot perfect timing i will show my technique which i have improved gobaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan a huge amount of fireballs are breathed out from it i cant predict how many casualties will be caused if that hits the city there are kids in the city so theres no way i can dodge it goooooooooo boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost i released my demonicpower which i have increased to the utmost level towards the fireball i then made a command just before the dragonshot and the fireball were about to collide beeeeeeeeend the dragonshot responded to my command and curved like a baseball fork ball here it is this time go upi put my righthand upwards the dragonshot which did a forkturn now goes upwards im imagining sirzechssamas techniques i have been practicing in secret after seeing that to control the dragonshot which i have shot out that is i made the dragonshot go below the fireball then make it go up
so i can push it up bang while making a loud collision my dragonshot lifted the fireball up into the sky the two enormous powers cut through the sky very high up in the sky both of them exploded because of the intense amount of power the whole sky was covered in the explosion due to the dragonshot and fireball taking each other out it creates a strong wind if it shot out the fireball at the city then it would have caused a disaster the whole city would have been in flames the monster then made a roar again and began charging at me again but its not something i should fear i have received a more dangerous and fearsome charge than that its nothing compared to the attack of that shishiou13 oryaaaaa i punched the face of the monster again i then push it forward after the punch i did a spin kick to the side of its head i still havent finished yet then its eyes glowed in a mysterious light its trying to release light from its eyes ddraig shouts so its a beam huh i twitched my body and dodged the light im a devil
so light is my weakness wait right now its a bit confusing whether im a devil or not either way since it seems dangerous im dodging it the six rays from its eyes went past me and hit directly behind me then doooooooooooooooooon along with a loud explosion the ground vibrates violently when i looked there is a chasm till the end of the ground and so much fire is coming out of it you must be joking the attack is so deadly that it altered the area itself the underworld will be annihilated if he keeps on using that partner i have good news from greatredwhat is it tell me quickly there is a finishing move hes saying you will definitely win if you use it alright i wanted to hear that but the problem is that this whole area will be destroyed if you use it here hes saying that the destructive power is insane are you serious if sekiryuushinteisama says that then it must be true if i have to use it i should throw the monster up and then use it right yeah thats the only way yeah so how should i do that that would
be the problem while i was thinking of a plan i made a conclusion after seeing someone its possible if it is that person i then speak to grayfiasan grayfiasan can you hear me it is i ise grayfiasan who heard me then flies towards me isesan then the gigantic sekiryuutei is you im glad you are safe yyes thank you very much but what is this gigantic form grayfiasan and the others look at me suspiciously but theres no time to explain it grayfiasan i will explain about this form afterwards theres something i would like you to do there is a way to defeat that monster please cooperate with me grayfiasan made the face of warrior after hearing me you look smart and beautiful riass oneesama let me hear it what should ino what should we do yes are you able to make that monster go up into the air if you can do that i can release a special attack grayfiasan smiles at my request which isnt even a proper plani see its a plan that is very easy to understand more than that your special attack sounds very heartening lets do it if i cant do
that then how can i call myself the queen of the lucifer group grayfiasan flies up after agreeing to my plan the amount and richness of the aura is something which is beyond ours the air is shaking and it feels like the temperature dropped grayfiasan then gives commands to her comrades soujisan please cut off jabberwockys leg grayfiasan gives the command to the samurai wearing a shinsengumis haori roger that grayfiadono the samurai shortened his distance from the monster hes fast isnt hefaster than kiba the samurai called souji puts his hand on the katana located on his hip there was a moment of silence by the time i realised it the monsters right leg had been cut off from its knee i couldnt even see him draw his sword but his movements are similar to the guy i know is he kibas master while i was thinking that grayfiasan and her other servants fly towards the monster a magiccircle is created below the monster which is falling down the leg which has been cut off is already regenerating disgusting tentacles are coming out of its wound and are trying to join with the foot that was cut off
and with such a high speed that is this monster will stand up again if we dont do something about it while it was happening it seems like the technique has been completed and the gigantic magic circle beneath the monster glows we will take it up now isesan grayfiasan shouts then the monster gets pushed up by the impact from the magiccircle yeah that guy is being blasted up into the sky now ddraig prepare for that special attack ou leave it to me ddraig responds to me immediately and the chestpart of the boostedgear scalemail slides open then a cannon appears this islonginus smasher its a taboo power which you are not supposed to attain ddraig says that with a low voice longinus smasher i think one of my comrades said i used it when i went into juggernautdrive they said i blasted off shalba in one hit with it well who cares if it can beat that monster then i will just blast it duuuuuuuuun a silent vibration an unbelievable amount of aura is gathering at the cannon on my chest amazing the amount of aura gathered isnt that of crimsonblaster is this the power of greatred
the monster high up in the air has just finished regenerating its leg it seems the charge finished just in time the monster which has been sent high in the air looked at me and it gets ready to blast light and fire from its eyes and mouth but im faster my target is that monster i wont miss it longinus smasheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer zudooooooooooooooooooooooon along with my shout a thick red aura is blasted from my chest the monster was about to blast its light and fire but greatreds aura envelops it along with its body the absolute power which dyed the whole sky in red the aura blasted from my chest stops when i check the skythe monster has been blasted away without a trace amazing so this is the power of sekiryuushintei i have only been saying the word amazing the whole time but this is amazing paaaaaaa then my body glowed red when i realised it my height has changed when i looked around the size of the surroundings have returned back to normal i can see the buildings and trees in their previous sizes then that means i reconfirm my own size ah its back to normal
my body has returned to its original size when i look up in the sky i see the gigantic red dragon greatred greatred is looking at me more like it is looking at ddraig when greatreds eyes glowed a bend is made in the sky is it trying to make a hole to the dimensionalgap the bend expanded and became large enough for greatred to go through i saw the sky of the dimensional gap through the hole greatred opens its mouth after looking at me once again i then hear greatreds voice for the first time zoom zoom iyaaan tthats impossible does greatred also have to say that seriously please forgive me ah it goes home back to the dimensional gap after saying that horrible zoom zoom iyaaan zoom zoom iyaaan greatred is still saying it even after it has gone through the hole repeatedly that is the greatred disappears into the hole while saying zoom zoom iyaaan it went home like that what the fuck is that i didnt hear it boku14 didnt hear anything moun what do you mean moun why did you say boku the more ddraigs speaking manners change the more he is running away
from reality zoom zoom iyaaan ophis who suddenly appeared next to me also says that what the hell why do legendary dragons and those who get involved with them love thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis i defeated the gigantic monster by combining with greatred but i can only scream at the horrible way i had my farewell with the sekiryuushintei part 2 comfortable i changed into my balancebreaker and im currently flying in the sky the one who is on my back is ophis she seems to be very comfortable riding on my back after i defeated the gigantic monster i left the remainder of the situation back there to grayfiasan and began heading to the city i sensed the presence of rias and the others while i was riding ongreatred they should be there if im not mistaken wait there are columns of smoke rising from various parts of the city from the sky i can see many buildings and roads that have been destroyed it seems like everyone was evacuated because i dont sense the presence of any people an evacuation order must have been issued in response to the huge monster that was heading here but there really arent any people
here tthen why are the buildings and roads destroyed the monster shouldnt have reached the city thanks to grayfiasan and the others maybe the remaining remnants of the oldmaou faction are causing destruction during this crisis or maybe its the herofaction i see he must be right that must be it its the organisation that shalba beelzebub belonged to im sure they must have caused this during the current ruckus to the west ophis who is on my back says that west ophis then answers me over there the ones called asia and irina are over there are you serious did she remember the presence of asia and irina well who cares ophissama sure is convenient i spread my dragon wings and head towards the direction ophis gave me after a few minutes of flying i began to sense familiar auras aaah theres no mistake about it it must be it i have only been away from them for a very short time but it feels very nostalgic at the location where there are many columns of smoke rising from i confirmed the presence of several shadows there they are rias asia akenosan konekochan kiba xenovia irina rossweissesan saji and
sonakaichou gyasukeis he unconscious ah sairaorgsan and that lion are there as well i dropped down in the middle of them after confirming it was them everyone also looked at me who is flying towards them i have finally arrived hyoudou issei i have just returnedi said it out loud to everyone i returned everyone huh thats weird dont i receive anything such as we are glad you are back or we were waiting for you i look around everyone seems dazzled hhmmmmm everyone looks as if they are being pinched by a fox ah jeanne is here as well herofaction heracles is also on the ground was everyone fighting the herofaction i dont see cao cao anywhere though jeanne is also looking at me with shock maybe they dont recognise it is you ddraig says that are you serious do things like that really happen tthen i will say something which i would usually say i open the mask of my helmet and showed my face then i said it with a smile umm oppai i have returned while riding on greatred the moment i said that ise isesan isekun isekun isesenpai ise isekun is that you isekun hyoudoukun
you were alive hyoudou rias asia akenosan kiba konekochan xenovia irina rossweissesan sonakaichou and saji call out my namehey hey hey hey do i really need to confirm myself by saying oppai my existence sure is a horrible thing like always i was in shock after reconfirming my existence then asia konekochan and akenosan came running towards me they then clung onto me while hugging me isesan isesan isesan isesan isesan senpai welcome home please dont leave me again i dont want to live in a world without you ever again arara everyone is crying so much yes im not crying i knew that the man i have chosen wont die as if you are crying im going to cry without holding back ueeeeeeeen xenovia and irina seem like they are crying too thank you for worrying about me you were safe just like i thought to be expected from you do you also have your body underneath the armour rossweissesan is both happy and shocked at my return well yes many things happened in the dimensional gap and my body is back to normal aaah i see i understood with rossweissesans comment i was thought to be dead thats
natural its the truth that my body was destroyed as a result of receiving samaels curse and only the evilpieces returned to everyones side even so i returned alive rias walks to me while crying she puts her hand on my cheek and then says it im glad you are backi can feel her warmth from her hand aaah this is it this is the warmth of the woman i fell in love with im glad my body has returned not touching the body of a woman is absolutely a no no more than that riass oppai have returned to their normal size i was worried because they shrank as a result of the bustpower that is able to heal my aura im so glad i really feel relieved of course the place where i belong is next to you and my comrades spank there was someone who hits me from behind when i turned around it was saji hes crying a lot uwaaaaaan you idioooooooot i i heard you died so i aaaah he even has a dripping nose i just felt like patting sajis head im sorry i am alive i thought it might be you when a
dragon that seemed like greatred appeared in the sky you sure are something sairaorgsan smiles at me by putting his hand up ah someones voice when i looked jeanne had a defenceless face on im sorry you were really defenceless when isekun showed up so i had myself rescue the boy kiba was carrying a child far away from here did something happen did jeanne take that child as a hostage uwa i didnt realise it my eyes then met with kibas who had just saved the child welcome back isekun thanks to you i was able to save this child to be expected from a hero im glad you havent changed though i never expected you would come back with greatred man he still has the refreshing smile of a goodlooking guy but im relieved if you were like that while i was gone then the gremory team must have been active while i was away jeanne then glares hard at mei never thought you would return alive from your fight with shalba you are truly terrifying sekiryuutei well thank you so what now are you going to take us on when i provoked her like that jeanne takes
out something which looks like a pistol and a small bottle is she trying to start a shooting battle no there is a needle on the tip of the pistol is it an injection the other small bottle must be phoenixs tear is she trying to heal herself isekun be careful that can power up the sacred gears ability by several levels kiba gave me an explanation like that i see so its an injection like that i dont know what its made from but it means jeanne will powerup if she uses that jeanne points the needle at her neck a second use of this will cut quite a lot off of ones life span but it looks like theres no other way than to use it after saying that she heals herself with the phoenixs tear and then injects the needle into her neck the next moment jeannes body gave a big pulse the pressure coming out from jeannes body increases and veins start to appear on her face i realise that shes going through a reckless powerup just from looking at it from what source did they make such a thing from jeanne laughs while making a
big shiver this is good my powers are increasing when she says that a large quantity of blades begin appearing from the ground its the holysword jeannes sacred gear is blade blacksmith the ability to make any sort of holysword using that she attained the balancebreaker to create a dragon but the thing she is trying to create isnt a dragon the holysword doesnt make a dragon but it instead covers her own body jeanne starts to get covered by the holyswords and what appears in front of me is a single large snake no jeannes upper body is growing out from the place where the snakes head should be her lowerbody turned into that of a gigantic snake she looks like the monster thats called lamia its a holysword version of that its troublesome when she gets into that state her offence defence and speed increase even more than the time when she used the dragonxenovia says that so xenovia has fought that jeanne did say that this is her second injection she must have fought xenovia just before then ufufu i dont like this appearance that much but its the truth that i have gotten stronger i will
have myself escape until cao cao gets here after saying that she gets ready to escape is she trying to escape no since it has gotten into a situation like this i wont let her escape i begin to imagine it in my head and get ready to use that attack i released the imagination from my head and opened a fantasy atmosphere now lets use this since i havent used it in a while bilingual i released my technique towards jeanne next is this question time hey jeannes oppaisan what are you going to do next jeannes oppai gave their answer to my question well im thinking of destroying the road so i can escape into the sewers ara her oppai are girlish and sound cuter than i thought they would wait shes trying to escape to the sewers i wont let you jeanne tries to move swiftly with her snake body she sticks a large holysword into the road but i move in front of her i then began activating my special move while making a stance to hit her from the side this move also needs imagination first i touch my opponents body and then i release
my imagination yes the thing i imagine is a naked body dress break while i call out the name of my special move i make a cool pose jeannes lower body which is made up of the holyswords begins to collapse as long as she is a woman there is no way for her to escape this move i also blow away her clothes the naked body of an oneesan i save it into my brain you are the worst i received a harsh comment from konekosama just like always impossiblei then released my last dragonshot at jeanne who became naked you borrowed ophiss powerand a part of greatreds flesh to revive your body the one who said that with an astonished voice isrossweissesan i did think you were alivebut i never thought you would survive by doing something as unimaginable as thatit far exceeded my imagination well i was also quite shocked when i woke up on top of greatred the power to attract the strong it truly is a scary thing if it can come this far i came here to look at the monster that was going to destroy the capital city lilith but i never thought
you would appear alongside greatred a new voice when i turned around cao cao was standing there just like always he is holding onto his spear and looking down at his fallen allies so youve surpassed them in a very short amount of time whats abnormal is the growth of the gremory group putting heracles aside jeanne should have used chaos break by looking at her she used it twice maybe there are demerits when you use it for a second time rather than worrying about his comrades he seems like he is evaluating why his comrades were defeated you can say that its just like him to do that everyone felt different when he showed up everyone here has either tasted or can tell just how strong he is his sights then move onto me theyre not the eyes of interest he had looked at me with during our last encounter theyre disturbing eyes where he is looking at me as if im something abnormal so you are telling me you have returned hyoudou issei from the information i got from the oldmaou faction shalba beelzebub was supposed to have an arrow covered in samaels blood with him yeah
i tasted that my body became useless but it seems like i got lucky because greatred just happened to be passing by i borrowed greatreds power to recreate my body though it was thanks to all my senpai and ophisall of the thought fragments of my senpais have vanished even though we had our farewells like thatim grateful to them with the many things that happened i had a hard time convincing them and i was always close to going berserk but we still had an understanding between us for a short time i wanted to talk to them even more hearing my words i thought he would reply sarcastically buthe had very serious eyes its my first time seeing such an expression from him unbelievable if you were to receive that poison then your chance of survival should have been zero and you are telling me you recreated your body with greatreds help and returned by yourself even meeting greatred isnt something that you can just refer to as luck hes wearing an expression that is saying he cant believe what happened and hes continuing to mumble to himself anyway he doesnt seem like hes going to attack us
anytime soon then this would be a good time i need to have her do that i then said to rias face to face rias please make me your servant once again yes right now my body doesnt have the evilpieces currently my body doesnt contain the evilpieces i had previously received from rias then that means i still havent returned completely yet i can only consider myself to have truly returned once i receive the evilpieces from the person whom i dearly love rias takes out the evilpieces from her pocket eight crimson pawn evilpieces rias directs the pawn pieces towards me the evilpieces make a bright glow in front of my chest and then enter my body silently riass lips then overlap with my lips i then hug rias i will never leave her side again im going to live on beside her from now on stay and live on together with me she says these warm words with a smile then i felt a crimson and hot nostalgic feeling within me i can feel the pulse of the evilpieces from within my body the power they give me yeah now its completed now i can fight as
hyoudou issei the pawn of the gremory groupyes i will stay and live on with rias my dream is to become the ultimate pawn i declare that very strongly yes im going to live on with this womanand my comrades im going to achieve happiness together with them after i got a familiar feeling back i banged onto my chest hard yes they stabilised within my body immediately to be expected from my evilpieces when i was ready to take on cao cao or anyone else a creepy wave appeared in front of me when i looked there black things appeared at a corner of the road then a weapon which seems like a scythe comes flying from it a robe with many ornaments a person who is wearing the mask of a clown appears i remember him the ultimatelevel grim reaper that assaulted us back in the dimensional gappluto it hasnt been that long since we last met everyone cao cao sighs at the appearance of the grim reaper pluto why are you here it seems like its an unexpected visit pluto then explains to cao cao its an order from hadessama he told me to capture ophis once
she appears no matter the cost his eyes move to ophis who is standing next to me this guy no is hades still after ophis she had her powers stolen and she isnt infinite anymore how much attachment does hades have to her i will be your opponent ultimatelevel grim reaper pluto then another new voice whos interfering this time wait i know this voice theres no way i will forget his voice there are only a few people who speak in such a battlefreak manner the one who comes down with wings of light between us cao cao and plutois that man covered in white armour like i thought you have returned hyoudou issei vali yes its vali man why are the guys who are against me popping up one by one are they planning to come and appear along with my returnwhile i had my head filled with all these confusing events vali says to pluto i wanted to take out my anger from back in the artificial dimension on someone i was having trouble deciding whether i should take it out on hades or the herofaction but i left hades to azazel bikou and the others i
was waiting for the herofaction to appear but the gremory group took them out then if this is the case the only one i can take out my anger on is you pluto vali says that up front he has his usual pokerface but i can see that there are signs of anger within his words this guy has lots of frustration within him right now pluto makes his stance at vali after spinning his scythe i hear that you sent fenrir to hadessamas place i received the message just before coming here the fang that is able to kill a god is truly a serious threat weve truly received a terrifying assault we captured fenrir for such occasions its a dangerous thought were you hoping to fight the gods from each of the factions if we dont have a negotiation tool like that we wont be able to take on god head on right very well but for me to take you on who is the true descendant of the lucifer and also someone who is the hakuryuukou i really dont know what will happen even though ive lived for such a long time it feels like my soul
will go even higher if i defeat you he accepted the challenge so its hakuryuukou vs the legendary grim reaper vali then says it after changing his helmet to its usual state it seems like hyoudou issei convinced the past hosts of the heavenlydragons but im different don vali then gets enveloped in an insane amount of aura tthis guy is he going to get serious right from the start hes emitting out an insane amount of aura to the surroundingsi will show you the other form of juggernaut drive where ive completely sealed off the thoughts of the past possessors wings of light spread from his body and they are emitting demonicpowers the purewhite armour is enveloped by very bright lights then from each of the jewels i the one to awaken am the hakuryuukou who will take the law down to the darkness the shallow thoughts of past hakuryuukou are flowing into me from the jewels what we strengthen is the height of the heavenlydragon the path we go is the road of the domination of the hakuryuukou we stop the infinite and devour the dream these people dont have any grudge or hatred and they are filled
with an overwhelming pure fighting will did they come to understand each other through fighting i walk the road of domination with infinite destruction and by piercing through the imaginary dream i shall become a pure emperor of the dragon i shall have you obey the silverwhite illusions and the perfect evilways juggernaut over drive the one who appears in front of us is covered in silverwhite armour and is emitting an amount of aura so enormous that he looks like he came from a completely different world he hasnt even touched anything yet things around him like the vehicles and public property are being squashed the aura coming from his body is enough to crush down the surroundings i realised it as soon as i saw it yes that this guy is truly a monster the thoughts of past possessors who i went through a lot to convince and the juggernautdrive that i have thrown away due to it putting my life in danger this guy turned both things into his own power with only his talent and he sublimated it and this guys is my rival hehe he is insane i realise it once again that maybe i
have promised a showdown with someone truly insaneempireo juggernaut over drive it is similar but different to juggernaut drive an enhanced form which only i can use you shall taste this strength with your own body the one who goes slashing at vali who just said that is pluto he moves very fast while creating an afterimage and wielding his red scythe pluto is a strong foe who was able to fight on par with sensei you cant let your guard down against him crack in front of me the sound of metal breaking echoes thats because vali broke plutos scythe with his fist quite easily he broke that evil scythe with only one hit pluto seems shocked but pluto receives an uppercut to his jaw while making a loud sound plutos body gets lifted high up into the air vali directs his right hand towards pluto and he closes his palm compress compression divider divide divide divide divide divide divide divide divide divide divide divide divide divide plutos body which is lifted high upstarts to get compressed in length then next by width then again by length next by next plutos body gets halved something like this such power
like this pluto screams as if he cant believe what is happening to him vali then says it without any mercy perish the grim reaper whose body became so small that i cant see it with my eyes starts to lose his body to nothingness while having the air vibrate the grim reaper perishes and that was the last of that grim reapervali who changed back to his usual balancebreaker from silverwhite armour is breathing hard but he defeated that grim reaper without allowing him to do anything by looking at it that form drains him a lot but its certain that he killed pluto in an instant so this is the answer vali got from juggernautdrive at this point it is clearly much more powerful than my truequeen form that guy vali is getting even more powerful even my comrades became speechless at valis strength though sairaorgsan is smiling with joy twoheavenly dragons are truly terrifying the one who approaches us while saying that is cao cao vali i was right to not allow you to use juggernautdrive back in the artificial dimension vali gets such remarks from cao cao but he breathes out juggernautdrive excels in terms of
destruction but it comes with danger to your life and the risk of going out of control the form i just showed you minimised that as much as possible but whats different from juggernaut drive is that it can be strengthened even more cao cao your greatest failure is that you didnt kill me when you had a chance cao cao became silent at valis words cao cao then looks at me i want to confirm hyoudou issei what are you even if he asks me that i am just me while i was thinking hard cao cao twitches his neck like i thought it really is weird no matter how much i think about it it is hard to qualify you when you returned by your own powers you are no longer a heavenlydragon but you also dont fit in the truedragon or dragongod category thats why who actually are you then wont oppai dragon be just fine i couldnt be bothered so i answered him like that he shows a dumbface for a moment but he laughs and nods immediately i see yes thats easy to understand after confirming that he points his spear towards usso what should
we do now will the one who will play with me be hyoudou issei or vali or sairaorg bael or will you come at me all at once no taking on all of you will be impossible it would be reckless if i take on three longinuses what provoking words no matter how strong he is he wouldnt last if he were to take on vali and sairaorgsan as well especially after seeing vali just now he doesnt have a chance to win vali approaches me and says it with a small voice his seven treasures you know up to four of them right cao caos ability huh yeah the one which seals womens abilities the one which destroys weapons the one which transfers attacks and the one which transfers his opponents i saw that in the battle a few days ago if i take him on he wont be able to use the one which seals womens abilities so i only need to be alert of six of his abilities the other three abilities are the following to allow him to fly the ability to create many doubles like kiba yuutos blade blacksmith balancebreaker and the last one is
his sphere which focuses heavily on destruction i see the one which allows him to fly the one similar to kibas and the one sphere with great destruction power roger that but i never thought he would explain it to me anyway i will give you my thanks so it would be up to me now huh suddenly it became a situation where i have to take him on while thinking that i took a step seeing that cao cao smiles happily so my opponent will be the sekiryuutei i see and the others arent moving knowing that like he said everyone confirms the battle between me and cao cao and are acknowledging that yeah i have a huge debt to pay him yeah i cant calm myself until i pay you backthere is a part of me where i cant accept that i lost against him without even having a chance to display my truequeen form while sensing my will to fight he starts to tap his spear on his shoulder interesting that time i finished it by aiming at triainas weak point but this time i will take you on when you are using your full power turn
into the crimson armour of course i will be using it lets go ddraig ou our opponent is the ultimate longinus once again if you cant beat him here then you wont be able to call yourself the sekiryuutei of course while emitting an enormous amount of aura from my body i start to say the chant i the one to awaken am the sekiryuutei who holds up the truth of the king uphigh my senpais who answered this chant are no longer here holding the infinite hope and indestructible dream walking the road of righteousness i will become the emperor of the crimson dragon but im not alone i have my comrades who look over my fights with warm eyes and i will lead you to the path of heaven glowing in deeptruecrimson light cardinal crimson full drive my armours colour changes to crimson and its shape changes as well promoting to truequeen is completed the evilpieces feel good as well no wonder theyre my evilpieces i was able to use this form immediately after my return my truequeen is still unstable but i have to do it while seeing my change he also makes the ring and seven
orbs appear around him his balancebreaker sure is quiet like always its so silent that it is creepy hatsutei ratana cao cao flies up after putting his orb below his feet so thats the ability that allows him to fly i spread my dragon wings and also fly into the airboost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost i released the dragonshot up into the sky where there are many tall buildings lined up i wanted to show him a even larger one but he made one of his orbs come near me he made a spiral appear in front of it and it sucks in my attack thats the ability to send an attack to another location so hes planning to release that attack elsewhere while i was staying on high alerta spiral is created below me and the dragonshot comes out through it wow i dodged it and shot out another block of demonicpower boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost this time its the scattered type i shoot them out at random gahapatei ratana cao cao made one of the orbs go in front
of him and it starts to grow then several humanoidtype things appears its one of the abilities vali explained earlier it certainly is similar to kibas balancebreaker where he can command the soldiers he creates so its basically soldiers being created from the orb those creations perish after getting hit by my dragonshot so he used them as a shield during the attacking and defending that just took place cao cao vanished where is he when i was trying to locate him a spear comes towards me from the side i somehow dodge it while only allowing it to graze my armour a bit but the armour plate covering my stomach is destroyed in the process but there is no damage to my physical body you you are using the same ability as kiba also theres not much difference between your ability and kibas who you previously made a fool out of even your creations cant use your techniques either i cant believe you were even able to make fun of him back in the artificial dimension he defeated kibas ability with ease but in my eyes kibas ability is superior than the one cao cao just showed cao cao
laughs at my argumenthahahaha maybe so but i told you didnt i that my abilities still need tuning and that they arent complete yet thats the reason i took an interest in kiba yuutos ability back then though his ability was still at the same level as mine so i lost interest in it immediately also my ability is a bit different from kiba yuutos ability well that depends on how i use it from now on so thats how it was then this guys ability will become a pain after he finishes tuning it oh man seriously taking on you who defeated azazlsensei sure is a pain governor azazel huh certainly i defeated him in the battle back then but if we fight again i will most likely not win so easily whys that his fighting was overwhelming the part where he dodged senseis attack and then immediately impaled his spear into sensei has been burnt deeply into my brain i still cant believe sensei lost thats what i thought but cao cao says words which i never could have anticipated theres no way i can look down on that governor those scientisttype warriors will research their opponent until
their battle strategy is flawless for the next time they fight them for guys like me who will be taken down with a single heavy blow those type of opponents are truly frightening thats why i realised the governors strength in our first fight and defeated him in my second fight against him but the third time will be dangerous for me its just like cao cao says theres no way that sensei will stay quiet after being taken down if this guy and sensei fight again it will be a close match cao cao then makes his stance after spinning his spear now lets resume our battle ah again cao cao begins to disappear and then reappear since im battling him in the sky above the city i need to be alert of whats beneath me as well it certainly does get me on my nerves this time he appears behind me i was able to dodge it up in the airbut hes seriously appearing in unexpected places shit he suddenly appears as if he just got transported from nowhere transportation oh yeah one of his orb had a ability to allow him to transport to any place he
choses so he can use it on himself man it sure has lots of tricks just like rias saidback then each orb has the same shape and size so i wont know which ability it has until he uses it just like now he can use it as a combo so he has many varieties with which to attack me the power of his spear is already very scary to begin with but his other abilities are hard to take care off for someone dumb like me fighting an extended battle against him is unfavorable he probably has a phoenix tear with him as well but there is a way to defeat him its also because i will win if just one of my attacks hit him but i thought of a plan back in the dimensional gap after losing to him i need to make him put his guard down even though i thought like that my battle with him is extremely intense no matter what sort of attack i use he either evades it using his orbs or he just blocks it i already have my hands full with evading the holyspear which suddenly appears from all directions
even if i change the direction of the dragonshot i shoot out i cant even make him blink also the soldiers created from one of his orbs appear by instant transportation so no matter how much distance i have with him i dont have time to fix my position star sonic booster even if i close my distance with at extremly high speed he either runs away by teleportation or he buys time to evade it by using the soldiers as his shield solid impact booster even if i somehow close my distance and give him a hit with a lot of destructive power he just evades it by using the abilities of his orbs my punch which misses him gets stuck on a building and the building collapses immediately im sorry to whoever the owner of the building is oh yeah he understands the weakpoint of armour type sacred gears he evaded the attacks of sensei and vali when they attacked him at the same time so it would be natural for my attacks not to reach him at all because armourtypes have extreme power during their attacks aura gathers at certain parts so he said its easy to
predict the attacks even if you know that with your brain actually responding to the movements shows that he is insanely strong also his right eye which is a medusas eye he can change anything to stone with it my armour also has many parts that have been turned to stone everytime that happens i destroy those parts and have them fixed luckily it hasnt turned my physical body to stone maybe its his fightingstyle to not let his opponents regain their footing for even a instant buildings around us are destroyed because of me and cao cao im glad there is no one here no it isnt good it feels like i will get yelled at afterwards anyway i will apologise as much as they want me to as long as i can defeat cao cao but im getting pushed back little by little the way my armour is getting destroyed is getting worse he starts to get a grasp of my attack style in this form what a fearsome guy for him to move around this much even though he is a techniquetype he easily surpasses kiba even if i want to use crimsonblaster i need a bit
of charging time and that may become fatal against this guy for a powertype such as me my compatibility against him is the worst then i felt something when i spread my wings to that direction a single ray of crimson aura hits me and replenishes my aura i then saw rias on a building far away who shot the oppaibeam to me aaaah rias you made the size of your oppai smaller again for me riass love for me feels very supportive the power i received from the woman i love there isnt any power stronger than this i even sensed her thoughts without even planning about this rias and i must be connected deeply from our hearts it sure makes me happy the beam from a breast that i heard rumours about i see you couple are really terrifying cao cao says that while laughing this bastard he laughed at riass oppaibeam i wont forgive him taste this boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost boost i transferred the power to the fire within my stomach and i brewed a huge flame of fire the fire of a dragon widerange attack the
whole sky gets dyed with my fire my opponent is a human even if i cant hit him directly it will give him a huge amount of damage if he gets burnt by it with this he wont be able to defe zabaaaaaaaaaaaanthe holyspear releases enormous amount of light and it eradicates my flames oh yeah vali did mention it that cao cao is able to release intense light if he wanted to he then swings his spear to the sides from his stance oh crap i evade it by flying up high but the huge wave from the holyspear split the building and the building behind it in half and they collapse the wave pierces through to other buildings and many of them collapse so many buildings collapse just from him swinging his holyspear with power in it if a devil like me receives that rather than my body getting split in half it will perish before that can even happens cao cao then says it with a smile of joy hahahaha amazing so this is the rumored truequeen my attacks cant even give you a clean hit but your attacks arent hitting me either it truly gives me
chills i will be finished if i receive your attack but my attacks dont show any signs of hitting him if you are saying that then please get hit by one of my attacks it will end with that right he wields his spear while spinning it i dodge the slash coming beneath me and i dodge the slash above me be stepping back then a orb appears on the tip of his spear his smile then got stronger comparing you to vali you are still lacking parinaaya ratana the orb comes flying towards my stomach i then gathered the aura on both my arms and shaped it into a thick arm the power of rook i will block it with this i receive the attack by having my arms crossed the moment it hits me an unbelievable amount of impact goes through my arms to my whole body so its even useless with the power of rook i then realised it immediately its the orb which focuses on destructive power bbut i never thought it had this much attack power i fly back because of the impact craaaaaaaaaaaash i went crashing towards the window of a building i even
went crashing through until reaching the walls of the building and then eventually passing through the building even the next building also the building after that and again crashing through walls of buildings i crashed through so manybuildings that it became stupid to continue counting them and eventually i crashed violently into one of the walls of a certain building and it stopped gough from the pain i have on my stomach i spit out things from inside my stomach it was vomits of blood i received this much pain from a single attack putting my organs aside did a couple of bones get broken my armour is basically destroyed from that attack just now even my arms which i had made thick with the power of rook are destroyed both my arms are paralyzed so they cant move properly so that attack just now is the one which concentrates on destructive power but why didnt he use that before does it take time to use it or are there restrictions on how many times he can use it it should be one of them its weird that he hadnt used such an attack until now he could have easily
defeated me if he included that attack numerous times during his combos because he used it this late there is a high possibility that it has a few requirements for its use hehehe since i have been fighting so many strong foes even an idiot like myself is able to think about that it sure isnt easy being a sekiryuutei hmm i then realised the place where i currently am the one that falls near my hand is the doll of switchprincess when i look around this is a toy store where it has so many dolls lining up because i entered by crashing through the window the collision made the dolls fall down this is with this i took a certain doll with my shaking hands i then thought of something looking at switchprincess doll in my hand the seven treasures i just used is also incomplete the ability is also unclear right now im having it concentrate on heavy destruction power but it overlaps with the ability that destroys weapons it would be good if i can think of a good ability i cant give it an ability that is too farfetched so are you done already so
this is the limit of you who has used the crimson armour huh cao cao says that and appears he entered through the broken window hey tell me if you fight vali in the form he used before will you win no the form vali used to kill pluto instantly it wouldnt be an exaggeration if i were to call him a superdevil so it will be impossible forme to beat him as well its a simple difference in power and power output he can take me down just by using power alone hearing that i felt relieved geez its not like me to worry about my rival but yeah that guy wont lose to this guy the one who will beat him head on will be me only me but i need to overcome this obstacle somehow kukuku i couldnt hold myself back from laughing whats funny cao cao asks me with doubt its the same as back then yes that time when i had a one on one battle with raiser this circumstances and situation in that match i also hit my limit at the last moment and was put in a tough spot but even so i
was still able to fight hey cao cao i have also fought by aiming for my opponents weakness to protect the girl i liked and to take her back by using my small brain to the fullest what are you saying i dont get what you are trying to say i dont think you have gone crazy are you planning to do something that time the only thing i had left was the dragons power which i had a bit of that situation is no different from this situation i show the switchprincess doll to him the one i just picked up earlier there is a trick on this doll and the oppai part can be shot out rias became astonished when the testtype doll arrived at our house sirzechssama thought of this doll and what about it i then took out a single bullet from my pocket its the one i picked up from the dimensional gap i retrieved this from a golem floating in the dimensional gap a bullet from the antimonster machine gun i found in the gogmagog that had stopped moving it was supposed to have been made a long time ago but it has asimilar
shape to that of the bullets of the current era maybe the power of creation that humans possess is similar to that of a god now i said that while loading the bullet on the oppai of the switchprincess doll i then transferred the power of the sekiryuutei to it transfer while transferring the power i pushed the button on the doll then the bullet placed on the oppai part of the doll increases its speed when it gets shot from it and flies towards cao cao have you gone mad cao cao hits the bullet easily with his holyspear then the bullet which was hit away breaks and releases a liquid from it the liquid then goes on cao caos face to his right eye cao cao wipes his eye after receiving it what is thisliquid while wiping it his body goes through a change gough cao cao spits something out of his mouth blood guha he suddenly begins to suffer and gets on his knees his body is shivering he got down on the floor with his legs and hands on the floor and realises it after he vomits out more blood tthis is uguwaaaaaaaa right now he
must be going through a pain that you cant even describe in words the pain is so insane that he shouldnt be able to endure it i stood up with my arms and legs which have returned to normal and i then said it to cao cao who is on the floor its samaels blood the one shalba used against me hearing me cao cao opens his eyes wide i continue explaining i had the blood of samael get taken out of my body while i was having my body recreated i then thought about it while having samaels blood bedisposed of wasnt the curse god gave to samael the one where he placed his hatred towards dragons and snakes like that my eye my medusas eye his eye has already been crushed with samaels poison and so much blood is coming out of it yeah medusa is a monster with hair made of snakes right then maybe you who had her eyes transplanted into yourself will receive the same effect from samaels blood thats why i thought about this back in the dimensional gap then i had ophis transfer samaels blood into the bullet i found in gogmagog yes
i used my small brain to the maximum to find a way to defeat this guy back in the dimensional gap but if i was to fight this guy anytime soon then i needed to have a plan against him while i was thinking that we went past gogmagog which was floating in the dimensional gap and i remembered my fight against raiser gough haahaa fufufu i never thought you would use such a method cao cao laughs to himself while going through intense pain i was also on the verge of death since im a dragon but also a devil even if you are the descendant of a hero and have the ultimate spear you are a human can a human like yourself withstand that curse most likely not my body has already stopped functioning phoenixs tear will have no effect onsamaels curse so the reason why i lost is because im a human fuhahahaha for me who has been researching my opponents weaknessesto turn out like this its the most sarcastic thing ever even though he is going through intense pain he laughs to himself yeah your weakness isthat you are a human cao cao shouldnt be able
to fight now his balancebreaker has vanished already the power i could sense from the holyspear before has vanished it is my winfor me to win using a doll of rias and with the switchprincesss oppai missile zoom zoom iyaaan switchprincesss doll made a sound like that hahahaha it sure is like me i blurted out laughing because i found it funny hey the past hosts zoom zoom iyaaan sure is amazing no wonder you guys became crazy about it then i will use truth idea wwhat did he say i became astonished at what cao cao just said he grabs the holyspear with his trembling hands and makes a stance and starts to speak spear the true holyspear which pierces through god suck the ambition of a king of domination sleeping within me and pierce through the gap of blessing and destruction you announce the will and turn into a glow along with cao caos chant the tip of the spear opens and magnificent amounts of light start glowing out from it maybe it will be bad to let him release this much amount of light anymore than this i mean what will happen from senseis talk whats sealed
inside that spear is something like the will of god who has passed away vali said it is similar but very different to juggernaut drive i dont know what it is about but juggernautdrive is the embodiment of destruction that gets out of control it seems like truth idea will also cause huge destruction to this city if released should i increase my guard or should i use the power of knight to escape from here when i was choosing my option the light from the spear gradually starts to weaken the tip of the spear which was wideopened returned back to normal cao cao saw that he became speechless and shocked for this guy who had been showing so much confidence until now to be like this then does that mean cao cao then explains as if he is answering my doubt its notactivating so thats what happened after all i was a bit prepared myself when i saw the huge amount of light but what i can feel from the spear isnt that much of a threat more like isnt the holy power weakening then caocao made an expression as if he got his answer after sensing something
from his spear i see so that is your will so you have picked sekiryuuteis dream over my ambition i dont understand even a bit of what he just said but does it mean the spear wont be powering up now so you received the curse cao cao the one who appears saying that isvali he came through the broken window and he looks down on cao cao who is on the floor hey vali your rival is the best i wont hand him over to you cao cao why did truth idea fail you used it just before right i sensed it when i was coming towards this building vali asks him i also want to know that vali then opened his ears to cao caos words truth idea is related to the will of the god from the bible the will of the deceased god sucks the ambition of the holder of this spear and by responding to how strong the opponent is it creates many effects and miracles that can be something with absolute power to destroy the opponentor a blessing to the opponent to capture their hearts but the answer the truth idea gave to sekiryuutei
is silence then it means that sekiryuutei won this match and this spear wants to see hyoudou isseis dream over mine the god of the bible acknowledged me as the winner the god liked my dream over cao caos vali then smiles in amusement after hearing that so that holyspear chose hyoudou issei and not cao cao thats why i told you remember that you should take down me and hyoudou issei before we become out of control and this is the result an end which just seems dull like i thought the person who has the right to defeat the sekiryuutei who turned into a crimson colour is me cao cao laughs at himself hearing valii wanted to defeat him can you stop saying homo stuff between guys its nothing but disgusting i feel sick because lately strong foesespecially guys look at me with keen eyes i want to be popular amongst girls i wont be happy if i get popular with muscular guys yeah thats right i will be the one defeating hyoudou issei my friend sure is very popular and the ones coming in now are sairaorgsan and kiba now the number of guys in here has
increased once again i hate this atmosphere it truly is hard to breath in here and all of them are looking at me with passionate eyes nooooooooooooooooooooo rias asia akenosan konekochan xenovia irina rossweissesan ravel please save me twoheavenly dragons king of lions holydemonic sword certainly this is a bad situation for me more like i would be killed at this rate maybe i was already cornered by the time we lost leornado no maybe laying our fingers on you meant our loss like i thought maybe it would have been better to use samaelon not ophisbut greatred i never thought that the encounter with the gremory group and our choicemeant as our flag to lose even though hes laughing at himself he is starting to lose breath not only is he saying something that i cant understand but the colour of his face is turning bad he wont be able to hold in samaels curse like how vali did using his demonicpowers so his condition will just get worse then a familiar mist surrounds us then a person appears from the mist lets return cao cao the one who appears next to cao cao is georg who is very
torn hes missing one of his eyes and one of his arms his leftleg is coloured in black and he is not in a proper condition georg cao cao wedid have many miscalculations but we werent wrong excepthe takes cao caos hand and activates the transportation magiccircle he then looks at us i wont let you escape everyone except vali goes towards them but the holyspear releases a bright light and we couldnt move our body and use our eyes for a moment so he still had this much power in him we will be eliminated if we get involved with the twoheavenly dragons just like shalba and the others you are right georg while getting his body burnt with the holy power sairaorgsans fist cuts through the air they are no longer there we were a second late because we had our eyes become useless for a moment from the bright light they left after just saying that part 3 i let them escape at the crucial moment i can only close my mouth to myself for being nave while i was feeling down sairaorgsan pats my head dont feel down its your victory looking at their conditions both
of them wont be able to fight for a while no they wont be able to fight as how they used to anymore from their wounds sairaorgsan says that i wont know how much effect samaels poison will have on him but even myself who is both a dragon and a devil had my body destroyed easily from it so nothing good will be waiting for him after this vali then says it while looking at me if you got in contact with greatred then before challenging that sekiryuushintei i need to finish my battle with you first so a declaration of battle already huh its just like him yeah bring it i will become even stronger and defeat you but be careful while many will fear you there will be more coming after your life thats what it means to get in contact with the truedragon and dragongod that sure is scary well if they will be coming after my life then i just need to overcome themeven if anything comes to me i will just continue walking ahead for my dream to become a highclass devil and become a haremking and i also want to become the king
in the rating game as well hearing my declaration he smiles with enjoyment ddraig will you be resting for a while yeah maybe so or maybe im sorry albion albion and ddraig are talking to each other what are they talking about then i sensed another person coming here the one who enters through the door is the man in the clothing of a gentleman arthur vali everyone is here like we planned we made a rampage i see vali turns around arthur then looks at kiba kiba yuuto it seems like you are the most worthy opponent that i have been searching for with my holyking sword collbrande the time when vali has his battle with hyoudou issei i will also seek a battle with you until then i hope we both dont get involved in anything unfortunate saying that vali and arthur left kiba is also smiling at the challenge he received from arthur somehow did this guy become stronger while i was away he even has the demonicswords that belonged to siegfried on his hips did you defeat siegfried i ask kiba while pointing at the demonicswords on his hips eh oh this well many thing happened
siegfried was defeated by all of us oh is that so but he received the demonicswords now i also have my servants waiting for me i will leave then sairaorgsan walks towards the window sairaorgsan thank you very much sairaorgsan waved his hand at my gratitude he jumps off from the window he left stylishly from the window just like sairaorgsani will also go and call everyone isekun you rest here kiba also jumps from the window saying that im by myself now when i was thinking about looking around the shop until everyone gets here partner that was a good fight for you to also start fighting not just with your power but also with your brain you still lack in many departments butit was still a good fight ddraig praises me what is it all of a sudden no you should be fine with this you seem a bit unenergetic i can hear his voice being cut off something like this has never happened before looks like i used too many things to revive your body i will lose my consciousness very soon wwhat do you mean whats happening why didnt you tell me then the conversation between
you and albion just before is a farewell you are lying you are joking right wait hold on a second dont worry i will make sure you can use the boosted gear even without me thats why im glad i was able to see a good fightat the end ddraigs voice starts to get cut off even more and his voice is becoming small and weak wait i stilli still cant do anything without you you can you haveyourcomrades i amno longerneeded his words are getting cut off no this is too much i need you you are my partner lets stay together forever we are a sekiryuutei together we had beendoing stuff together at school at home against kokabiel my firstencounter with vali during the camp at the mountains during the summer against the sitri group against loki even at kyoto and the match against bael my tears arent stopping i have so many tears running from eyes and i even have snot coming down from my nose the things that are coming to my head are the memories i had with ddraigand i couldnt do anything about it for you to die because of restoring my bodyi dont

should be here soon yeah it finally finished my midclass promotion test that is the test which was long and hard finally finished no the test hasnt finished until i go home lets go home ophis this timewith everyone i will return home to the sekiryuuteis house ophis made an adorable smiley face yeah she isnt the boss of the terrorists after all she is just a dragon who is strong and lonely then i remembered something what should i do about my school midyear exams i finally fell into despairazazel part 1 the tension in this scene calmed down when i azazel received the news that the alliance was able to defeat bandersnatch and jabberwocky we had been glaring at hades the whole time just looking at the face of this skeleton bastard makes me want to puke sirzechs made his power of destruction aura disappear when he heard about our victory and he reverted back to his usual form well maybe the other form might be his trueform though the anger that could be seen from his aura decreased a lot when he heard that ise had returned well i also felt the same way geez he sure
did come back in an insane way apparently the terror caused by the oldmaou faction is mostly taken care off as well the underworld also avoided the worst case scenario and the vali team vanished long before i received the report they sure are magnificent at escaping as always i also had slash dog leave we probably dont need him now anyway we were fortunate that we werent reduced to eliminating hades no matter if this guy is an embodiment of evil he still is the god of the realm of the dead even if he is rotten if we had terminated him it would have a great effect on all the factions of the world then when we were about to return home after making our complaint and telling hades about the current situation one of the grim reapers came to make a report to hades hadessama the majority of the grim reapers within the shrinehave been frozen is this your doing joker hades eye sockets glow in a dangerous colour dulio himself just made a sigh and is massaging his shoulders well i would get scolded by michaelsama if i dont at least do this i was thinking
of freezing any suspicious grim reaperssan but i couldnt be bothered so i froze most of them within the shrine im sorry i have bad habits anyway amen he sure has an aloof personality and words but hes definitely strong this dulio who is the trump card of the heaven has a bad mouth but his power is overwhelming its insane that he froze the grim reapers within the shrine zenith tempest the toptier longinus that can control weather and control any sort of attribute with the way he uses it hesable to be in control during appropriate situations since it turns out like this even inside a building maybe he has a good compatibility for fighting against cao cao im sure he would have the advantage in the fight anyways we were able to stop hades from interfering this is a big result this skeleton definitely was planning on it since he doesnt have any flesh on him its hard to read his expressions but i can tell hes quite unhappy by looking at his facial bones well we will definitely question you a lot about the incident with samael okay since we were able to capture the main
members of the herofaction alive i said that to hades yes the gremory group encountered the hero faction i sure cant believe the fateful encounters they have whether its good or bad but this time that was a good thing thanks to that we were able to capture heracles and jeanne i will question them very slowly theres nothing better than witnesses who are alive but hades couldnt reply back to my words sirzechs speaks before we leave hadesdono we will take our leave here im very sorry for the sudden visit sirzechs apologised politely he then says this with an intense pressure but i will still say this there will be no next time next time i will eliminate you this maou says it while releasing something crazy hades laughs with joy after hearing that fafafafa you show me good eyes yes i will remember that very well well i dont want to come back here either i blurted out my true thoughts by accident seriously dont ever do this again skeletongod of the realm of the dead part 2 sirzechs calls out my name when we reached the gate that connects the realm of the dead and the
underworldazazel he put on a formal face what is it why so formal lately there are things which i think quite often about that the generation of maou such as myself and ajuka is coming to an end hmm that sounds interesting i kept quiet and sirzechs continues the biggest reason why we became a maou was due to our powers they are special devils who were born with insane power who dont carry the blood of maou thats the current yondaimaou after the big war between the three great powers several devils like those were born sirzechs put on a sad face while making a grip no matter how strong you are there are things you cant do as oneindividual it will give birth to ones that rebel yeah the current government defeated the old government with power and changed the underworld and the ones who stood on the front were powerful devils like sirzechs and the other current yondaimaou as a result the devils that were driven away became jealous of sirzechs power and cursed him the basic and simple reason for the current coup dtat but you know azazel there are huge things which are different from
the power of a oneindividual and that exists in the current underworld what is that thats the power of a circlegroup my sister rias and my brotherinlaw isekun were born with that even if there is a limit to the power of oneindividual the power which gathers around them circlegroup makes the powers and bonds to something certain as a result they break any limits and walls and continue to grow that not only applies to rias and isekun sairaorg who wasnt born with the power of destruction and who has a dream gained faithful comrades by believing in his ideals that is also the power of a circlegroup maybe vali will also fit in the category of circle around him comrades are gathering naturally i see the power of a circle huhsirzechs ise has even attracted ophis now many beings wont be able to ignore him yes i can say the same to vali who has surpassed juggernaut drive the infinite dragon god and the twoheavenly dragon and the dragonkings which gather around them like i thought the ones who will be controlling the flow of the world and powers are dragons yes dragons are the embodiment of power
and even humans have symbolised the power of dragons since ancient times no matter what they do a strong dragon attracts strong ones where will ise and vali go i still havent witnessed it ah i will be leaving here then there are things i need to report to michaelsama the joker dulio made a simple farewell to us while moving his angel wings then see ya it was fun today circle circle he flied off while making a circle with both hands above his head so he had a bit of a funny side to him huh wait so he was listening to our discussion casually huh i made a sigh while looking at dulio flying away now i will need to find a new job then sirzechs narrowed his eyes hearing me so thats how it will turn out yeah having ophis meet with ise because of my personal thoughts is something i wont be able to avoid responsibility for iwill resign from the governor post no matter how you think about it having ophis meet ise in secret from all the other factions is a violation of the alliance its natural for me to get the blame
if i stay as the governor of the grigori any longer than this it wont look good on those working under me and it will cause trouble for them and the ones who have been helping the terrorists within our groupthe majority of them have been capturedthe traitors of our organisation are vali and those working in interim posts especially a group of toplevel fallenangels had been giving out information to them those guys have been captured and we have most of them being judged well there were those who escaped thanks to that the top people in our organisation have been reduced the number of natural born fallenangels have also decreased the numbers of leaders have decreased where it is possible to count them now as compared to long time ago and most of the ones that remained are scientists types like sahariel benemune and tamiel the vicegovernor is also that type of guy looks like it will be the end for my organisation when i said that sirzechs made a very sad face the heaven also captured and passed judgement on the traitors and the ones who escaped turned into fallenangels and escaped to the khaosbrigade huh well
its a miracle that they didnt turn into fallenangels while they were helping them those highlevel angels that is i heard that there is a hole in all the systems in the heaven due to the absence of god they must have used that looks like there arent any perfect places after all the devils will also have more quarrels with the oldmaou factions from now on as well since the ones who determined that this incident wont succeed hid themselves straight away they sure are strong guys but with this incident quite a number of strong foes from the oldmaou faction have been eliminated they will stay quiet and hide themselves unless something big happens wont the fallenangels increase their numbers like the heavens system for the brave saints sirzechs asks me i shook my head its okay villainous angelssama like us are already numerous enough with just us this isnt just my opinion the remaining leaders have the same opinion we all think that there is no point in increasing our organisation any more then it already is because the three great powers are in an alliance its enough if we can stabilise the current situation wellif the
angels above the sky ever fall down then we will welcome them any time but the grigorisazazels achievement to bring ophis to our side is a big truth its something which wont be weird to be recorded in history azazel and the one who made that happen is none other thanyou sir dont say sir to me now its embarrassing but you know what sirzechs im a boss who leads the villains even if i get recorded in the bible i shouldnt be recorded in the history of the underworld the ones who will be recorded in the history of the underworld are enough with you rias and ise im okay with being the boss of the fallenangels azazel dont put on a sad face like that i will be troubled if you put on such a face i then said it with a naughty smile while scratching my cheek dont worry its just my title which would be changed i will always be me and i will also retire from fighting on the frontline thanks to you and michael i made lots of good students i can spend the rest of my life looking after them it will be
okay for me not to fight if ise the gremorygroup vali and his team are present hearing that sirzechs blurts out laughing as if he finds it funny you suddenly started acting like an old person even if i look like you i am old you know i existed before you were born so you should make me look good lad yeah i will say that i will do that then just as a look sirzechs sure knows how to talk well anyway this incident is finished now maybe i should go for an onsenhotspring trip to atami or isu taking the idiots with me the news about the fallenangel organisation the grigori governorazazel resignation from his post was sent to all the factions he leaves behind many meritorious deeds and battle achievements but the vip of all the factions passes on the legacy of him instructing the two heavenly dragons the current sekiryuutei who shows irregular growth andhero you look pathetic cao cao you prepared so much but did the plans of the herofaction fail due to betrayal or due to something unexpected you even had three toptier longinuses get crushed well if it isnt sakrasama i never thought
you would come down to this world the sacred gear possessors who achieved balance breaker and longinuses are out of function and you georg and leonardo cant be active anymore right what are you going to do i will rebuild it the new ophis will be born so i will create a new khaos brigade by having that as the center of it but because of this incident we have lost quite a lot of man power for a short while i will be hiding myself do you really think that your face right now doesnt say that your face is that of someone who had their soul crushed you got crushed by the twoheavenly dragons right samaels poison even if you do cure it it will leave an aftereffect you know you are just a human after all being crushed by the twoheavenly dragons huh i wont deny it you sure look pathetic so what did you want to become after all a hero a man of valour or a villain no did you become greedy and want to become all of them for me who was born as a descendant of a hero while also being the possessor
of the ultimate spear this was the only path available for me the only option where i had to fight against the superiorbeings hahahahahahahahahaha shitty bratkun listen to the words of god that arent so nice okay then people like you who usually have bclass powers but get sclass powers when serious are quite common the problem is crazy guys who have bclass powers in usual times and when they are serious but gets sssclass powers when they need to finish it these guys are the most troublesome in a battle where we could definitely win they reverse it with unknown things you tasted that yourself right yeah that sekiryuutei is that type of guy if you want to win against types like sekiryuutei then you have to show enough power where you can alter destiny itself after all your peer longinus possessors are that sekiryuutei and hakuryuukou maybe you were born in the wrong era next i next hahaha there isnt a next time you end here you know that you are worthless after being rejected by that spear and receiving the curse where you cant move anymore what are you going to do with me nothing much you
will be sent to the realm of the dead along with georg and leonardo hades is really unpleasant right now so you guys can cheer him up you can wait for the spiders web to come down there but i will be taking all of your longinuses for me to take it from you guys in the balancebreaker state it sure makes me happy that tears will be flowing out from my eyes ze you sure are a horrible god who were the ones who were trying to control me and the other gods from the shadows well you just basically received your punishment for it i will give your holyspear back to you if you can come back from the realm of the dead since you are a hero you should be able do such things after all the sekiryuutei did do something similar you knownew life a few days after the ruckus ended in the underworld we were told something outrageous from sensei at the club room you were removed from the post of governor are you serious eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh yes the news about azazelsensei being removed from his post the reason is because he made us meet with
ophis sensei makes a sigh while digging his earhole you are noisy it cant be helped i made ophis come here without telling those noisy bunch tthen what is your current status when i asked him he twitches his neck hmm something like the supervisor of this area which is one of the important locations for the three great powers alliance my position in the grigori is as an advisor of special technology so hes a supervisor and an advisor for technology haaa his position seems like it has changed but it hasnt changed from a governor to a supervisor konekochan says that well thats the gist of it shemhaza became the governor of grigori barakiel is the vicegovernor man i feel better those positions suit hard headed people like them with this i can concentrate on my hobbies huh he has an even more frank expression than before did removing him from his post give him more freedom that sounds like it uwaaaaah shemhazasan barakielsan please do something about this person i suggest to have him sealed away before he does something maybe you should think of putting him in cocytus hes definitely on a level of samael for
being sealed away sensei was all hyped but he then took out three certificates the result for the midclass promotion test was released just before in place of sirzechs who is busy i will announce the results are you serious the result is already out we didnt receive any notification beforehand and we are going to get the results now first of all kiba you passed congratulations you are a midclass devil from today you will receive a call about the awarding ceremony sometime soon i will give you the certificate now uwaa he started without giving us a chance to be ready for it and kiba passes thank you i will gladly accept kiba receives the certificate and bows his head down aaah my friend became a midclass devil right in front of my eyes next is akeno you also passed now you are a midclass devil i told barakiel beforehand and he started mancrying the moment he heard it geez tousama thank you very much i will gladly accept it akenosan takes the certificate with a red face akenosan also became a midclass devil safely and the last remaining one it must be mine lastly ise yyes ii
feel nervous apart from the practicals i dont have that much confidence for the written test but it doesnt mean i did bad in it either sensei didnt care about how i was feeling and just gave me the result you also passed congratulations its the birth of a midclass devil sekiryuutei i did it yyeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i raised both my hands up and yelled from today i am a midclass devil yeah im so happy i somehow got promoted midclass devil im a midclass devil from today on with this i have gotten a step closer to becoming a haremking no i should have gotten ten steps closercongratulations congrats congratulations well this should be something we all expected but congratulations its natural because i was your manager but congratulations asia xenovia irina konekochan and ravel congratulate me thank you everyone im glad i reincarnated into a devil i was so happy that i was crying but sensei points his finger at me well you are an idiot who was able to return from such a dangerous situation by yourself did you know that your feat of how you returned is being spoken about by the people standing in very high
social positions after all the antifactions of the current maoufaction have started to fear you wwhy is that of course they would you wont die even if you get killed theres nothing more fearsome than this right not only did you not die from samaels poison but you came back from the dimensional gap by receiving a new body with greatreds power how crazy are you you are really weird not only your brain but also your existence it certainly was a repetition of weird events but for me to be feared by the toppeople in the devil society the situation is getting so big that im confused about whats going on in the underworld it is broadcasted that i took down jabberwocky fighting alongside the lucifer group and greatred who came by coincidence the fact that i combined with greatred isnt told to the public well your power to attract strong foes is so insane that it can basically attract anything so thats why you guys should be the ones to defeat the guys who are doing bad stuff around the world that way both i and sirzechs will be able to relax thats what sensei says seriously that
would be too much im fed up with fighting strong people i want to have a life where i can do erotic stuff with the girls in this club im not seeking for a life where i would be fightingum sensei what happened to the khaos brigade more specifically the herofaction after that their leader cao cao received samaels curse from my attack im sure nothing good is happening to him now but its that cao cao we are talking about maybe he has healed himself by finding a cure also because of hades and the oldmaou faction their main forces were taken down so the attacks on important locations by the herofaction has stopped as well also thanks to you guys we were able to capture their main members alive and they are being interrogated as we speak the longinus possessors such as cao caoprobably arent in a good situation either the wounds they received are ones which cant be healed with phoenix tears and twilighthealing but the heaven has found out that their longinus havent vanished so theres the thought that they might still be alive sensei answers me heracles and jeanne are captured in the underworld the
longinus possessors such as cao cao georg and leonardo can not fight anymore due to their wounds but their longinuses havent vanished two exact longinuses can not exist at the same time and if i recalled correctly if the possessors die the longinuses will move to new hostswas it its the same as my sacred gear and if they havent vanished then that means the possibility of cao cao and the others being alive is high but to sensei it didnt seem like it added up is there a possibility of them being stolen away if the longinus possessors such as cao cao have serious injuries then it wont be weird if there are people who would try to steal their longinus that organisation has so many factions that it seems they have serious quarrels amongst one another rias says that i see you can also look at it like that the grigori has already created the technology where they can remove the sacred gear from the host and keep it away or also transfer it to another person such a method should have been known to the khaos brigade due to the traitors amongst the grigori who went to
their side so its possible to think that the longinus from those guys who have serious injuries have been taken away sensei nods at riass comment yeah a possibility like that might arise if that happens then i hope it wont turn into the worst scenario that i have thought ofsensei had a very serious expression just what is he thinking inside his head sensei then laughs well their biggest mistake was to lay their fingers on you guys and they got beaten instead so the herofactions mistake was to lay their hands on you guys who have abnormal growth rates its like those teachings where you will receive a curse when you touch gods that you shouldnt touch or in this case a devil who shouldnt be messed around with dont say it as if we are some sharp knives from our perspective we just fought back because they attacked us right everyone i asked everyone yes the grudge we have towards them for attacking us during the school trip is big im michaelsamas ace i will beat them to pieces if they attack us again xenovia and irina agree with what i said see we crush them if
they attack this is the unavoidable rule of the gremory lately i also received a few grateful but scary words from konekosama lately i started to think that they come to me so i can gather points to become a highclass devil if we fight with the current members then it would be better if the enemies are stronger rossweissesan sure has a nice brain which allows her to adapt quickly but it isnt as good as you say sensei makes a big laugh after hearing everyones responses to be expected from the gremory group this certainly will turn into a legend soon something like you wont be able to come back alive if you touch them rias made a sigh at senseis joke we arent a curse or an evil spirit dont say it in a weird way ufufu but if they assault us then we have no choice but to crush them even though akenosans smiling she shows the expression of an s sensei continuesbut the khaos brigade is still active we can judge that their biggest faction the oldmaou faction and the second biggest faction the hero faction have stalled as a result of losing their leaders
we have finished punishing most of the traitors among the alliance but there are still those that are against us the bunch who have been hiding in the shadows of the two factions will also arise if i remember correctly theres a faction of magicians right dont tell me they will also assault us this only makes me feel more insecure the power of the heavenly dragon seriously is no joke sensei then looks at the corner of the room well their former boss is with us anyway we also look at where sensei is looking ophis is there she followed me to the school club room when her eyes met with mine she says this im friends with ddraig yeah i feel honoured having a dragongod say that but im not ddraig i have a name which is hyoudou issei my friends call me ise i understand ise arara she answered immediately she sure gets things right away when you talk to her she became really attached to me to the point where she follows me everywhere and when i return to my room shes already sitting in there she copies what the other girls do by looking at
them and she takes interest in everything so the girls have fun playing with her so there is always someone who can play with her what is this feeling something similar to an animal something like how dogs and cats are attached to a person or more precisely being attached to uroboros yes that would be okay to call me that should be fine sensei then says it after looking at the discussion between me and ophis ill tell you now ise but even if you become a highclass devil in the future you wont be able to make ophis your servant you know the reason even if i dont explain it right yes because ophis isnt here rightyes ophis is here right now but thats not how it was told to the public normally it would be something forbidden for ophis to be here but it seems like ophiss power that was stolen by cao cao became the current ophis of the khaos brigade well even they wont be able to say something like our boss ophis has disappeared which will put them in a disadvantage sensei continues she was someone who was a boss of the terrorists even
if she came to our side it would be bad if people in the underworld found out about it thats why we had many seals placed on her to have her the power of a dragon which is a bit strong well the fact is that godclass were not subjected to be reincarnated using the evilpieces it seemed like it was possible for halfgods like valkyries though so she has to be considerably weakened because she had her power sucked away by samael though she was stronger than most and she saved me back in the dimensional gap that alone made me think that ophis is my comrade if there are people targeting her i would protect her at all costs ophis did so much for me but for me to be a midclass devil i need to refresh my brain for a bit it will take more time for me to get used to it what will happen to ophiss power that was stolen by the khaos brigade thats something which bothers us kiba says that hes right ophiss power which was stolen using samael cao cao said he would use that to create the new ophis but what
would happen if the herofaction who was planning that is gone sensei then says including me people who know about that have different opinions except we all have the same opinion that currently their plan is still progressing no matter if its in a different form we might see that soon be prepared prepared huh looks like well get mixed up in things like that again i was having my head filled with all these thoughts then rias changes the subject its important to be prepared for things that might come at us anytime but i have three things i need to take care off first is gasper rias then looks at gasper gasper gets all nervous is it about that story i heard i wasnt there so i dont know anything about it but itseemed like gasper snapped when he heard a false story about me dying as a result he seemed to have beaten georg overwhelmingly using monstrous powers that georg he overwhelmed georg who possesses the hightier longinus dimension lost and who also uses magic when i ask those who witnessed it they all just say it was overwhelming gasper himself hasnt changed and hes still a
boy who likes to dress as a girl rias continues i was quiet about it due to many circumstances but i think it would be a good time to ask them about that power what do you mean by that rias nods at my question house of vladi no i will get in touch with the vampire clan if we dont take measures to properly grasp gaspers power not only gasper but all of us will also be harmed iim sorry ii never knew i had such power i thought my only problem was these eyes gasper says that while being scared he didnt have any memory of the events that took place while he had changed into that form he also didnt know about it a hidden power which had been there all along it seems like it isnt a sacred gear though rias thinks the reason why gasper was thrown out of his house is due to that the vampires are also having a huge quarrel amongst themselves their world is closed to the outside but thats also the reason why i hope nothing serious is going on sensei says it while making a sigh are you serious
so the vampires are also in a mess i dont want to get involved with them but it isnt good to leave gaspers power alone either it wont be good if we dont make it clear looks like we have no choice but to go im sorry for making problems but i dont want to see people from my house gasper lost his words he doesnt want to see his family huh well it cant be helped if he doesnt want to see them since they shunned him and then discarded him then he was taken down by a vampirehunter while he waswandering around and then saved by rias i didnt ask him the details but he also has complicated issues akenosan then says it while putting her hands on her chin along with the issue of gasperkun another one is about the magicians correct are you talking about the relations with magicians that are written down in books i ask a pact from a magician even i heard of that devils who respond to magicians summons its quite popular that it even appears in normal books rias nods yes magicians summon devils and they make a pact along with
a price we just lend our powers when necessary the ritual is a bit different from the one where we grant the wish of normal humans its normal for the famous devils to be summoned but young devils also receive such offers then does that mean we will also get offers rias nods at my question sensei continues while drinking tea yesterday the magician council announced the rating of young devils including your generation to all the magicians in the world to them it will be a win for someone to make a pact with the young devils first especially the gremory group who have a high rating starting from rias who is the younger sister of a maou there is ise who is the sekiryuutei kiba of the holydemonic sword akeno the holylightning priestess and the daughter of barakiel xenovia of the durandal and such you guys will receive lots of offers you know choose which magician you will make pacts with wisely okay if you choose someone worthless then it will lower your ratings are you serious so those things are also a part of a devils job huh then will i also receive an offering from a
magician gufufufu it might be good to be summoned by a very erotic magician woman then there was someone knocking my head while i was thinking erotic stuff its rias rias then asks me by the way ise do you remember what you promised me before the test thats the last thing that i need to take care off riass cheeks are a bit red yeah i remember that promise very well rias lets go on a date next weekend she shows a big smile to my words yes i will be looking forward to it my lovely ise yeah first is a date with her that will definitely be fun i will think about other stuff afterwards while i was thinking about it xenovia points to herself after buchou go on a date with me next ise ah not fair im next right i also want to go on a date with isekun even irina asks hauu me too i will also go on a date then me too even asia and konekochan me too let me enjoy japan more and i it might be fun to have a date with isekun to find bargain sales even ravel ophis
and rossweissesan araara then i will have a date with him on top of the bed after he finishes with everyone are you serious akenosan that truly is a very interesting thing aaah then maybe i should also get a date with him then umm then so will i eh is everyone going with the flow tthen me too even sensei kiba and gasper seriously spare me the guys rias pulls my sleeve and then hugs onto me im first right iseafterword our ise who was saved by attracting legendary beings hes a man who wont die even if killed when i realised it kibakyun became the main of volume 12 it couldnt be helped since ise was absent in the first half but even so kiba worked hard believing in ise to be expected from a heroine no i meant to be expected from a male of the gremory group the guys did very well kiba gasper sirzechs azazel sairaorg vali and saji showed strenuous effort volume 12 indeed smelled like man even i who wrote this reflected on my mistake by saying ah crap there isnt much girls well the guys are also popular so it should be
okay but it will be sad if the girls dont put a show so from next volume it will return back to normal even though it was underworlds crisis i apologise for not conveying it to the readers very well the main reason was due to ises dead or alive situation and his return scene and the story furthered away from monsters rampaging in each area after all the gremory group didnt fight them directly i finished it by making the monsters appear on television so if i can do sidesstory from the pursuit squad then i would like to fill it in with it volume 12 was the crisis of gremory group rather than the underworld now about the chapters for the story first chapter is volume 1 and 2 is the sekiryuuteis awakening chapter second chapter is from volume 3 to 6 and is birth of chichiryuutei chapter and the third chapter is from volume 7 to 12 the the hero oppai dragon chapter so the chapters name are getting worse and the fourth chapter will be the legend of oppai dragon and his lively companions chapter just like the name says it will be about oppai dragon
and his lively companions gremory group others rampaging i already planned on how the last volume will end quite some time ago and whats left is for the story to pick some stuff and keep on writing the relation with each heroine will still progress so please keep up with them for a bit longer im hoping i can continue to reveal the secret about gaspers power in fourth chapter the truth is the majority of the flow for third chapter plot has been discussed with the main editor about the time when volume 5 was releasedabout 3 years ago the big plot of loki appearance then beingtargeted by herofaction during the school trip then having a game with sairaorg then ises dead or alive unknown stategt resurrection was just as i was plannedthough the shortstory came in between what wasnt in the plan is ophis joining when the editor and i saw the volume 5 illustration of ophis drawn by miyamasan we fell in love with her and thought lets make her join the group i didnt originally have ophis to be the last boss anyway so i made her remain as a mascot so she will be active
as mascot from now on as well even if this was the climax of third chapter there was too much power up influenza sirzechs shows his true form ise combines with greatred vali kills pluto in a second and so many crazy thing happened in the past few volumes either the power up or their possibility has been pointed so im thinking about doing that from now starting from ises hakuryuukou power and also about asia and koneko xenovia also needs to learn how to fight not only using her power right and ises truedragon form super gigantic balancebreaker is a special form for this volume only i made it as a form which would be fitting for the climax of third chapter and the secondpart of two volume story and also azazelsenseis resignation he ended up taking responsibility for this incident but the one who contributed to ise and the group is him now also about the enemies cao caokun who was defeated by ise this volume his habits turned into his defeat he also ended up being hated from truth idea georg also let his guard down and was defeated by gasper they made a good example that
nothing good will happen if you get involved with the gremory group led by rias i was always thinking to have the herofaction defeated in the idea of they have the fighting style of human but lost due to being a human which is their weakness i never thought he would be defeated with a toy though so the khaos brigade will need to reorganise their organisation now the gathering of human herofaction who used many things for their own deeds didnt think about the selfishness of a god thats why no matter what they do they are always just human but khaos brigade is an enemy organisation throughout this series so they will also continue to appear from now on as well also i didnt explain it in the story but the balancebreaker ability of annihilation maker which created the bandersnatch and jabberwocky is subspecies and is called the bandersnatch and jabberwocky just like a toptier longinus it has the ability to destroy the world the name kind of overlaps with the sacred gear mirror alice that tsubaki shinra has but there are no connectionsthere are still unsolved plot the truth is the expansion of the whole world has
stopped around volume 7 and the story entered the part where it goes into the settings in details from the next new chapter the magicians and vampires that have been mentioned from before will be appearing i will reveal them in dxd original way the reason for the magic explanation in the third chapter is for the preparation for the fourth chapter oh and kibas swordmaster is sirzechss knight and he is none other than the captain of the shinsengumis firstdivision okita souji i had his setting around volume 4 but i didnt have the chance for him to appear but he finally makes his appearance this volume hes one of the best swordsman in the underworld he used 2 knight pieces hes the keyman why rias took interest in japan the weird knowledge of samurai is also his naughty habits it seems like many characters are appearing but most of them either disappear from the plot like many characters in this volume or they are onetime characters only so i think its okay to not remember other characters besides the main ones basically the main ones got involved in many problem with other groups since the second chapter and
it has the style where they solve the problems and get involved with groups led by the boss character now for the thanks miyama zerosama the main editor hsama subeditor bsama thank your very much for not only helping out in the light novel but also the anime also thank you to mishima hirojisensei hiroichisensei and dragon age editorial department for the manga i will depend on your cooperation from now as well now from the next volume it will be the start of the fourth chapter thats how i would like to do it but volume 13 would be a interval and be collections of short stories im planning to include short stories such as raisers return and about magical leviatan which has popped up the main story there will also be a new written one to be included as well and on top of that volume 13 which is collection of shortstories will have a limited edition which will come with anime bluray its a special where it will concentrate on rias and ises relation who have started to live together and could be considered as episode 13 of the anime the truth is i have written the
